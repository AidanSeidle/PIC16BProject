You open the game and finish your 3000 word essay that's due tomorrow while it loads you into the main menu. You pray they fed the server hamsters today as you queue for a game. You pick Octane cause you like running around fast, not cause he's on drugs. Your teammates pick Caustic and Wraith. It's another TTV Wraith. The champion squad is a pred and 2 master players. The game begins and your caustic spends all game on his own trapping buildings, while you run around juiced up looking for loot and killing anyone in your way. You get jumped by a squad because footstep audio doesn't exist and you couldn't hear them coming. TTV Wraith goes down. You clutch a 1v3 because mastiff is balanced. Meanwhile, your Caustic is setting up traps outside the zone. You collect your Wraith's banner and try to respawn them but they leave with 0.2s left on the timer. You're in awe that this one stayed that long. Someone sees you next to the respawn beacon and kills you. They then immediately get 3rd partied while a far off 4th squad member misses all his kraber shots on them. The predator player shows up out of nowhere and wipes everyone in one sweep, dropping another 4k 20 bomb in the process. Your caustic dies to zone. You're back in the main menu and a random level 500 is waiting there for you in your party. They complain about not having heirlooms despite playing since season 1 but the dude that started last week has 2. You queue for another game. You get disconnected because two server hamsters passed out from hunger. Code: leaf. You wait to load back into the main menu and queue once more, cause you know it's worth going through it all again just to take another glance at Loba's thick ass.

I am 41 years old and probably one of the oldest players on Apex Legends servers. I have to say I enjoy this game a lot. I have been playing FPS games since the original Doom, and I played Unreal Tournament (UT) and Quake 3 a lot when they were launched on 1999. To me, UT is the greatest, and I played every iteration since then. However, lately I think Epic (UT developer) have gone for kid-friendly stuff with Fortnite to milk them and lost hardcore people like me in the process. In comes APEX LEGENDS.
This is the sci-fi themed Battle Royale that I have been looking for. Excellent fight dynamics, very good character differentiation, good (but few) maps, great ping system and teamplay. I am married with children and still try to play a few games every night since I found this gem. And best part, it is FREE!! You should definitely give it a try."

I've always disliked traditional BR games as they're often unfair, rng focused and camper friendly. However, the difference about Apex is that here you won't be raging at a sniper kid that killed you from 1000m away hiding in a building like Battlefield or PUBG, instead you'll be raging at the sweaty TTV Wraith doing parkour in front of your face with a shotgun while you don't hit a single bullet.

This is the only BR that rewards aggressive playstyle, discourages camping and has a movement-based skill gap. And probably the only one worth putting time into to git gud."

Wanted to wait until 1000 hours to write anything, though admittedly I knew for the last ~500 where this was going to end up. I LOVE this game at its core. The actual game loop, the gamePLAY - wonderful stuff. Would literally never get old IF the matchmaking were...different(?) Stop me if you've heard this one before...

To preface this, I want to address the point delusional EA worshipers constantly throw back at my particular critique, before anyone even says it this time: Not everyone has the will, let alone desire, to browse Reddit forums in an effort to find similarly skilled randoms to play with in order to simulate a balanced matchmaking system. People on the internet are weird + I'm not a social butterfly. Sifting through all that ♥♥♥♥ is not for me and I don't think that's a reasonable expectation to have of your playerbase.

What I WANT to do is play with my actual friends, who have historically been willing, to their credit, to endure many sessions with me. Those sessions typically involve(d) them being instantly one-clipped to start an engagement by players they NEVER should've been facing in pubs, let alone ranked, and leaving me to attempt to 1v2/3, again, MOST of the time. I'm historically a 2-ish KD player at my best; I'm solid at the game, but I'm simply not capable of consistently beating Master and Predator-tier 3-stacks who populate our lobbies, especially not in a numbers disadvantage. But that's how it goes. Matchmaking sees my relatively functional skill level, ignores my friends' substantially lower skill potential, and away we go for 12 straight crushing defeats before someone decides this is a waste of time. And I can't fault them! It is absolutely a waste of time to just get steamrolled over and over and over because the game used your twitching corpse to fill ultra-high MMR lobbies instead of offering any kind of balanced experience. And imagine how much worse it is for my friends who are already weak players, trying to come back after extended breaks from the game. Forget about it.

I've been on hiatus from Apex for the better part of a calendar year now, but every once in a while I get the urge to jump back in, thinking SURELY this time it'll be different. I read the other day a post from EA/Respawn (whatever) from the beginning of 2022 describing the ""previous"" matchmaking system in detail (which I never expected them to ever do) and going pretty vaguely through their alleged plans to rework and revamp said system. They even admitted that the longstanding format, as everyone suspected, was simply matching the entire party to the best player's skill level for the purpose of finding an ""appropriate"" lobby. But supposedly their preliminary testing data for this new approach supported a more *gasp* balanced matchmaking experience for the majority of skill levels, and they intended to phase out the ""highest skill"" matchmaking that had made the game so cancerous for so long. I figured, ♥♥♥♥, this was almost a year ago! Surely by NOW it's fully implemented and I can actually rally the lads once more for the ultimate revenge round! Finally I can quench my thirst for this awesome but unplayable game! Then I browse the Steam discussions and some Reddit threads. By all accounts the matchmaking is worse than ever before, with all evidence pointing to some unannounced matchmaking change taking place over the summer. This is the overwhelming consensus online, even factoring out the people who are obviously just irrationally mad or calling everyone a cheater. I firmly believe based on my thousand hours in this game that the cheaters, while they totally do exist, are almost all hanging out in high-level ranked games. It's not common to find cheaters in pubs. However, I can totally understand how newer/less competent players would automatically assume they're facing cheaters when they're getting insta-beamed by players who should NEVER HAVE BEEN IN THEIR LOBBIES.

It's really, really sad to waste a game like this because of something so seemingly fixable. At least from a layman's perspective, why not just matchmake based on the AVERAGE skill level of your team? In our case, that would, in theory, largely squeeze out the top-1% players while also allowing in some people closer to my friends' level. They'd still have a challenge, but it'd be so much fairer for them. I would have a mixed experience, but much better chance of carrying a fight against a slightly stronger team if necessary. Let me be clear in that I do not by any means expect to be able to like, pub-stomp the way Preds do for views or some ♥♥♥♥. I want a challenge that my friends can REASONABLY hold up against, at least SOME of the time. And don't give me that goofy BS about the playerbase being too small to support the kind of solution I'm describing. There's over 120,000 people playing on Steam as I write this on a random Tuesday.

It just sucks. This is far and away my favorite PvP game of all time. I would play it daily if I could, even working full time. I would find time for this game. I would even spend money on skins and ♥♥♥♥, knowing full well that EA is evil and doesn't deserve a penny from me. The game is that freakin' good. In theory. But I gotta stop lying to myself every few months just to be immediately disappointed each time I try to go back. When I mention Apex at this point my friends just laugh and then we return to reality. This game is unplayable. Each season has brought with it some kinda new bugs to exploit or server instability or poor map rotation, etc. But the unfair matchmaking has been the one glaring constant for seemingly the entirety of Apex's existence outside of maybe the beta run, during which I was too bad at the game to notice any critical nuances. But yeah, the community feedback loudly confirms this. Glancing up, I see the recent reviews on Steam have been crap. Shocking. Yet here we are, again, as always. Perhaps EA's market research suggests that they shouldn't fix this problem for some disgusting micro-transaction-related reason. Honestly, at this point, I HOPE the reason is something outwardly malicious like that, if only to confirm that they have a vested interest in NOT fixing anything. Because otherwise there's just truly no excuse. RIP this game."

Apex was a truly amazing game. It helped me have an outlet, as well as something to play with my best friend. I had so much fun with it, I made the questionable financial decision to invest into the game for awesome weapon and legend skins. After 510 hours, and a decent financial commitment and interest, I wasn't able to play as things where getting busy with work. In that time frame, my EA account was hacked by someone (Not Steam, but EA. The thing I'm not using to play). I'm unsure of what that person did, but whatever it was, was enough for me to be banned for violating user agreement. Despite the EA support seeing the suspicious login activity, and acknowledging my account being hacked, they still decided to stand by the ban. So here I am, 510 hours in, and unless I want to spend 5 months going through legal issues, this is the end of Apex for me. I'm sure someone reading this would say I could just create another EA account, but why would I invest any more of my time into a game, where the very people who are supposed to support you when something happens, are punishing you for it. EA will not get a single dollar from me ever again, and I will pass the message anywhere I can, Overall, don't buy this game, and certainly don't spend any money on it, 'cause it could be gone in an instant."

out of all the BRs i've played extensively (PUBG, Warzone, Apex, Danger Zone, Fortnite) this is the one that i actually continue to enjoy. Warzone is way too sweaty, PUBG's the engine lag is too unforgivable, Fortnite is too goofy, and Danger Zone has too little to offer.

The movement mechanics in Apex are super fun and you can take the game as casually or as seriously as you want and the community is fairly decent regardless.

The legends are quite varied but not overly oppressive and the skill is mostly around movement and gun mechanics that is mostly the same for all characters meaning you don't feel locked out of your style of game play the way games like Overwatch can. And that skill ceiling is insanely high, developers are constantly adding content again, and games queue up very quickly so it doesn't get boring.

if you tried Apex when it first came out and then left you should give it another shot - i did the same and was surprised how much richer and fun the experience is in 2021 when i came back for the end of Season 7."

If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie.

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

EDIT: This review did not age well. Mobile got sacrificed at the EA altar and its lifeblood was squeezed into the dry, starving mouths of PC and console. As a result, we now have TDM, character class overhauls, a much better firing range, etc... I'm actually very pleasantly surprised. Let's hope EA doesn't yank on Respawn's leash and let them keep on improving the game.

Respawn's gunplay and movement are simply unmatched. No other game on the market except for maybe Call of Duty has guns that sound, feel, and look as good as the guns in Apex. It simply feels really nice to shoot things in Apex. It's truly the best of what the FPS genre has to offer. However, here's a big and stinky but: EA. These two letters, when put next to each other, strike fear into the hearts of five generations of gamers. The game is currently riddled with bugs, hackers, a scan-dominated meta, stale game modes, piss-poor matchmaking, and more. What does EA make respawn focus on instead? Pumping out more skins and collection events. This season is the most egregious one so far in this regard, with recolored skins littering the shop and events. Meanwhile, Mobile has 3 more legends than us, a highly - and I mean HIGHLY - requested team deathmatch mode, and tons of other cool features that the console/PC versions can only have wet dreams about. Thank you EA. You truly have the reverse Midas touch, where everything you touch turns into piles of doodoo."

I want to continue to love this game, the controls, movement & weapons are excellent and overall gameplay is super enjoyable... but the matchmaking will ensure you're never actually having fun. It's a sweatfest nightmare now. You'll be paired against absurdly high level people so far above your rank and skillset you'll question if the matchmaking is genuinely broken.

It also seems most of the OG devs have left Respawn (including the main map designer) as evidenced by (in part) the complete and utter lack of communication between the studio and community. Storm Point + Broken Moon are poorly designed snorefests that throw almost all their POIs on the very outside edge that are immediately consumed by the ring with vast expanses of nothing towards the middle. Patch notes no longer have any explanation as to why what was done and where, something done in most major previous updates.

This all leaves out the game's absurdly greedy prices for skins + events and etc. Don't buy them, seriously. $20+ for a single skin is ludicrous. And as of now (April of 2023) there have been six collection events since the start of the year. SIX."

With over 900+ hours on apex on origin and 400+ hours on steam, I can confidently say that I wouldn't recommend this game to newer players. With the amount of smurfs, highly skilled players posing as level 2 wraiths, running around in low level lobbies this game is not friendly to the casual newbies. Even as a prestige level 112, theres nothing more sad than seeing a level 25 pathfinder mow you down with hipfire hemlock shots from an angle that even a predator would cry at. Now I know most of you will say ""thats just a skill issue"" but when its in every single match, it gets quite annoying. Another issue is apex's skill based match making, the concept is simple, you get in matches with people who play on the same skill level as you. However, apex just throws players into matches as quickly as possible without regards to skill level.
I hope this review is helpful.
sincerely, a concerned player."

♦️ Apex Legends
Apex Legends is one of the best ‘feeling’ fps games on the market, everything is tight from the looting, to movement, the gunplay, and so much more. Being one of the few games standing after the battle royal craze, Apex Legends proves it is here to stay.

Monetization
→ Like most F2P games nowadays you should expect a real money cash shop. And for some skins in Apex you should expect to deal a pretty penny. Along with the typical battle pass, there is always something to try and catch your next paycheck. There are a fair bit of cosmetics to earn for no money spent, albeit with a large grind attached. Most weapon cosmetics are beautifully detailed, along with a ton of variety in customizing your own unique playercard.

Gunplay
→ Gunplay in Apex Legends is near perfect for any FPS game period. With 24 weapons available to choose from, each feeling as great to use as the last. Every gun in Apex is deadly if wielded correctly, this is because each gun feels skillful and is a joy to shoot. There is just a feeling of having the shooting in this game just ‘click’, and once it does you’ll never look at another FPS the same. The variety of recoil patterns, enjoyable to master bullet drop, etc. all combine to provide the core of Apex’s masterfully crafted gunplay. When you lose a fight in this game it doesn’t feel cheap, it feels warranted you know the mistakes you made. If there is one word to describe the feeling of gunplay in Apex Legends it is skill.

→ One major facet of gameplay to note, is that Apex Legends offer a respawning option for fallen teammates. This means that no team is out of contention unless completely wiped, as one person surviving a tough fight could lead to an impressive comeback. This is another beloved feature of mine that worked its way into Apex. As the worst part of any battle royal is dying and having to watch your teammate sneak his way into the top 5 for 20 minutes.

→ Apex offers trios and duos for unranked and duos ranked. It also has skill based matchmaking so you should encounter more players around similar skill levels to yours. Besides that, Apex tends to have a lot of variety in adding limited time modes to change up the pace. Ranging from solos, to snipers & shotgun, and many holiday themed events.

→ Arguably one of the most popular aspects of Apex Legends is its movement system, and how fluid it feels to traverse the map. Mastering the gunplay is only one half of the battle, the best players are able to zip through the map in tandem with near perfect aim. The default sprinting being relatively quick to begin with, with sliding down slopes to gain momentum, being able to climb walls for a couple seconds, are the basis of the movement system. Using all these aspects together have you looking at that boring street with a couple buildings and instead seeing a jungle gym of speed. Just line in the gunplay, after hours of experience it just ‘clicks’ and traversing the map turns into a sort of dance.

→ A battle royal is only as good as the loot it provides, and Apex legends is no exception to this rule. Like I said with 24 weapons to find, countless grenade types, attachments, med/shields there is useful gear to be found around every corner. As stated above, every weapon is capable in the right hands so finding a ‘bad’ starting weapon isn’t the death sentence it can be in other games of the genre. The first couple minutes of a hot drop, is almost like a randomized deathmatch: Where the best team that utilizes abilities, teamwork, and aim to reign supreme.

→ Not only are you searching for your favorite loadout throughout the match, you are trying to find attachments to enhance your gun. Now, previously I never really liked finding attachments in battle royals. But in Apex Legends finding the lowest quality attachments still feels rewarding and noticeable to use. So, it really lengthens the looting process instead of finding your complete loadout 5 minutes into the 30 minute match. Which might sound bad on paper, but in action it works extremely well. Almost eliminating the down time of teams camping buildings, and instead encourages constant looting extending into the late game.

→ There are also tons of grendes to find that offer that edge to turn that 2v3 fight slightly to your favor. In other battle royals grenades almost feel like a party trick, a real shot in the dark. But in Apex Legends using the wide variety of grande effects is top priority to ensure survival. From smoke grenades, to firewalls, sticky, explosive there is a lot to play around with. So managing your inventory with a healthy supply of ammo and the right amount of grenades is crucial. Then adding in the different types of armor and meds to carry, leads to inventory management being a key skill as well.

→ With this newest release of season 7 there are now 15 playable champions to choose from. Each offering a completely different playstyle, all with their unique advantages and disadvantages. It is refreshing to see that no two champions seem alike, which makes finding the perfect champion for you a treat. From Pathfinder’s grapple hook to help swing across maps, Wattson’s ability to anchor down tight corridors, Crypto’s drone for intel, and that's not even scratching the surface. Each champion offers a unique passive, tactical ability, and ultimate allowing for impressive synergy with teamwork.

→ There are two maps currently in Apex, Kings Canyon and World’s Edge: With the new map Olympus being released today! While they are by no means spectacular, they do serve their purpose and provide great scenarios for encounters to take place. Both are filled with key landmarks, that have you reminiscing of battles old and new. There is a real focal point on elevation in Apex Legends, which has you keeping in mind of possible locations of enemies at all times. If there is one thing to take away from Apex Legends map design, is to always have the high ground.

→ Despite Apex Legends stealth drop back in 2019, the visuals still hold up today with other games in the genre. Apex Legends has a futuristic look with a little unique twist from Respawns doing. At first glance the visual style might seem generic, but soon you will see all the original love poured into Apex’s unique art direction. Running this game with max settings at 1440p is a real treat even in 2020 standards.

→ The sound quality of Apex is also on par with its visuals, each gun has a distinct sound allowing you to easily tell what you’re up against. From the Kraber to RE-45 each gun has a satisfying . The real win in the sound design, is the top notch directional sound. In other games you find yourself locking in on sounds holding a corner, only to be fooled by him coming from the opposite end. Whether you’re in a building, 200m away, or right under them the ability to locate enemies by sound in Apex is unmatched.

Apex Legends is hands down one of the best battle royal experiences provided today. There are many advanced systems in play that all combine in orchestration to make for the wonderfully unique experience that is Apex Legends. Please do yourself a favor if you like BRs, tight gunplay, and titanfall style movement this might be your new bread and butter. Apex Legends is an play especially considering the barrier of entry, that is being free to play."

I can't say it's a good game, mostly due to the vast majority of its player base trying to get under your skin to make you as angry as they are.
I don't blame them. This game is so flawed in many aspects, and no amount of perks will ever fix that.
Take it from me. You could spend your time doing much better things, like learning to cook Bucatini with mushrooms & sausage.

Hell, let me teach you how:

You'll need:
-1 lb Bucatini pasta
-1/2 lb Italian sausage, casings removed
-8 oz sliced mushrooms
-1/2 onion, chopped
-2 cloves garlic, minced
-1/2 cup dry white wine
-1 cup chicken or vegetable broth
-1/2 cup heavy cream
-1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
-2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley
-2 tbsp olive oil
-Salt and pepper, to taste

1. Cook the Bucatini pasta in a large pot of salted boiling water until it's al dente. Drain and set aside.

2. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the Italian sausage and cook for 8–10 minutes, breaking it up into small pieces with a wooden spoon, until it's browned and fully cooked. Remove the sausage from the skillet and set it aside.

3. In the same skillet, sauté sliced mushrooms, chopped onions, and minced garlic for 3–4 minutes, until the mushrooms are tender.

3. Pour dry white wine into the skillet and cook for 1–2 minutes, until the liquid has reduced by half.

4. Add chicken or vegetable broth to the skillet and bring it to a simmer. Let the mixture cook for 5–7 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened slightly.

5. Stir in the cooked sausage, heavy cream, and grated Parmesan cheese until the cheese has melted, and the sauce is creamy.

6. Season the sauce with salt and pepper to taste.

7. Divide the cooked Bucatini pasta onto serving plates and spoon the mushroom and sausage sauce over the top. Garnish with chopped parsley and additional Parmesan cheese, if desired.

You're done! Go prepare some nice pasta and impress your friends."

Game-play :

- Its awesome if you have a good PC with decent graphics card installed otherwise god can help.
- Characters are great and I like their voices. :D.
- Best when you communicate and play with friends otherwise randoms will either make you mad or make you hero.
- You will find less people who actually talks if u are random.
- You will feel great when you actually win which is like <5% of your total game-play.
- Various game modes are there where you can switch which will make you busy.
- If you play regularly you will find various new events, which if you play will surely give you various in-game items guaranteed.


- If you are rich just buy the related character and get going.
- If you are fond of skins you either need to buy coins or wait and grind and wait for the skins to pop-up from apex packs.
- There are new events and characters which get released at every quarter, which you need to but for 950 coins, which either you need to buy or grind.


-Whenever there is any big update, there are lots of server issues specifically in Singapore ones which I play.
- There are also many bugs which comes up sometime like not able to connect to server, server crashes, visibility issues in games ans so on which are many times known or either random.
- Also, apart from the anti cheat, there are also hackers which are difficult sometimes but surely are there.
- And last but not the least, ranking system is a joke. I find player on level 3-4 destroying player who are in level 200 or so, hence that I think need to be fixed as there are lots of smurfs and throwers in games who sometime just sit idle in game and ultimately we loose.


- Apart from all the issues and experience I have, I have to say its a very good competitive game and I surely get lost inside while playing which is worth. So a big thumps up for that.


Anyways thanks for reading my review, I am still playing it and love it everyday. Cheers!!!"

Easily one of the best games ruined by bad management and run by a very greedy, short sighted publisher.

Pros:
- Excellent Movement.
- Satisfying gun play. Huge variety of guns of all types - Shotguns, SMGs, Pistols, Snipers, ARs. And they all are very good.
- Map sizes are excellent, not too big and empty and not too small either. Games are quick and no down time in the middle portion.
- New legends and weapons added every season.
- Maps are changed/updated every season keeping things fresh.
- Seasons are 3 months long offering plenty of time to complete battle pass.
- Completing a battle pass gives you enough coins to purchase the following season's battle pass (you only need to buy once if you wanted).
- Also recently started offering more free rewards with mid season events etc.
- You also get lots of free packs, just for playing and levelling your account.

Cons:
- Easily the worst servers in any of the major Multiplayer games out there ( 20 tick servers ! PUBG has 60 and Valorant has 128 tick servers !)
- Almost non-existent anti-cheat. (Some regions are unplayable because there are so many cheaters. Even worse they have barely done anything to fix this issue in years. They literally have one guy manually reviewing clips and banning people ! )
- Cosmetics are overpriced. One legendary Skin for a gun or legend will cost you $18.
- In Game audio is very broken, you can have entire teams land on you and not make a sound. Audio seems to be in a queue of some sort. You may be busy fighting one team and as soon as you are done you will notice another team in your face that you did not hear coming.
- Communication is terrible from the studio in general. All you hear is ""we are working on it"" etc.
- Also unnecessary drama as some of the devs seem to get involved with the community via twitter, resulting in arguments and other nonsense which is not needed, including trolling players via patch notes or tweets.
- Updates almost always cause issues for at least a few hours. Game becomes unplayable or you can't even get into a game.

- SBMM (Skill Based Match Making) or more accurately EOMM (Engagement Optimised Match Making) : When you log in to play your first game of the day you will be given an easier lobby to make you feel really good at the game. You will get plenty of kills and maybe even win the game. This gives you a good boost and you will keep playing. You will then be matched with harder and harder opponents and you will constantly die. You will also be matched with team mates of much lower skill than yours and much higher skilled enemies. On top of this you will also be matched with pre-made squads while you are playing solo with randoms (this is something they said early on that randoms will not be matched with pre-made teams). Eventually after you have been losing constantly and getting destroyed by better players you will once again be given an easier lobby just to not put you off completely and that you return again to keep playing. This system is designed to keep you playing the game ! There is no sense of fairness in the matchmaking. People are not matched on skill but based on the fact that you might stop playing. This was added or tweaked somewhere in Season 3 and been noticeable since. The devs as you can expect deny its existence (EOMM), while many people including myself have done tests to check this out.

The main reason why I can't recommend this game to new players is because I don't see things changing or improving. After waiting patiently for seasons I have realised they are good at stringing you along making false promises while slowly sneaking in more and more greedy tactics to squeeze more money out of you. Of course its optional and you don't have to spend anything but the money invested is not going into improving the user experience. Cheaters are still rampant, servers are held together by spit and chewing gum and each update brings new issues which takes them weeks to fix.

At the end of the day this is the analogy I can give for Apex Legends : Think of an amazing recipe, lots of fresh ingredients, high quality meat, lovely kitchen but they use gutter water and rusted broken pots to prepare it in."

The game is great.

I kindly wish to raise your awareness to people trying to cheat you out of your steam points: The following comment is copy and paste from a lot of reviews on steam. People do that to trick you into giving you steam points (the steam currency) by posting something to appeal to your human compassionate aspect thereby ripping you off because it is all ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, lies and deceipt.

""I am a 52 year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my son, who is now 16. My son recently started Dinkum and in less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, did the tutorial but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."""

It's absolutely impossible to enjoy Apex Legends!

The Good
Honestly, the core gameplay of Apex Legends has to be one of the best games out right now. The weapons, the characters, the movement mechanics, everything is deep and enjoyable. If it's all you look at, and when they truly feel balanced, it really is a great game at it's core, but it's potential is just ruined by terrible choices of the dev team.

The Bad
Horrific match making, there is no such thing as casual play. I can't understand it, what am I even playing? I'm a dad, I play a couple hours a week of video games, I just want to hop on with some buddies and get some kills and have a little fun, NOT ALLOWED! You will play against the sweatiest try-hards imaginable EVERY GAME, no breaks.

It's brutal, but not in the fun grinding haha brutal kind of way, more in the draining you of life almost immediately kind of way. If you play regular lobbies, you play against the top 1% multi-thousand kills players, you play ranked, you still play against those same guys! What's the point of either one, I just want to play against players around my skill level, I don't want to just get headshoted back to back by a triple-take from miles away.

I don't want to spend 10 minutes looting and looting with no-mic randoms just to be rolled and not even fire my weapon by a full masters squad in pubs. I don't want to get to end game with 10 teams alive and half of them are just rats in the most disgusting rat spots and I just have to wait til final circle and throw a 50/50 shot at who gets a down first. The game has deteriorated to such a point that you have to do the most boring stuff to win, or you die immediately from a third party every gun fight.

There's so much ugly about this game, the toxic player base, the hacking, the over-powered legends and weapons on release to sell skins, the overpriced store items, the audio, the list is endless.

Some of my favorite streamers, and yours', play this game and even for them it's a brutal grind but sometimes it's impressive what they can achieve and it makes it look like fun. The reality is very far from that, those guys play 8-10 hours every day for years to get that good. Playing this game for the first time, or even casually is absolutely impossible. A great potential game is ruined by its own awful match making decisions."

Apex Legends was the first Battle Royale game I put more than 1 hour into. Normally I don't play these types of games - they're just not something I personally enjoy all too much, but Apex Legends was different since a lot of my friends are really into this game so I was able to semi-consistently have someone to play with which is amazing. Putting in almost 20 hours, I feel confident enough to say I've formed an opinion about it, so this review is just that.

Do I think Apex Legends is good?
Honestly...yes. I do. I didn't expect it but I've been so far enjoying Apex Legends quite a bit. There are gripes I have with the game, but overall if someone asked me whether they should give this game a shot or not - my answer would be a solid yes. If that's enough to convince you - good, hope you go on to enjoy the game. For the rest who want to hear more - read on.

Gameplay:
There are a lot of aspects about Apex Legends that I enjoy when talking about gameplay. So let's break them down point by point.

- Gun play
The guns in Apex are satisfying to use. Most of them have really controllable recoil and the way they sound is just incredibly satisfying. If I had to compare it to anything, oddly enough I'd choose to compare it to TF2 - the gun play is rock-solid and seeing a really solid 60 damage, for example, is enough to give you that dopamine kick that lets you say ""hey I died but I had fun"".
Not everything is perfect though - one of my least favorite mechanics in any first-person shooter is bullet drop-off and Apex has that. I can understand why - for the sake of balance so that someone with an SMG can't just snipe across the map, but even at mid-range it just feels clunky and annoying.
On top of that some guns just feel kind of pointless. Prime examples for me would be most Energy Weapons and most Shotguns - their fire rate is usually abysmal and and take more precision to use. While this would be good in a tactical shooter in Counter-Strike or something, in a fast-paced battle-royale like Apex I just don't think they work very well and they aren't anywhere near as appealing as a Sniper Rifle or an LMG. I now understand why there's memes about shotguns in this game being bad - it's because they just really don't fit in with the way this game wants you to play it.
To clarify - I'm not saying they're useless, I'm just saying that other options will get you results faster & more efficiently.

-
This game's abilities to a newcomer like myself are really daunting and I feel like they aren't integrated into gameplay properly. It's the one thing that I dislike about this game being that you have no idea what you're getting yourself into or what you are able to do as a new legend, making me instead play an entire game without using my ability once.
But perhaps that could be seen as a good thing, as abilities are meant to be a situational thing you can use once in a while to either escape a sticky situation or get an edge on your opponent. But this left me feeling like some legends are more useful than others. Most of the time I end up playing Bloodhound & Lifeline because they're conceptually super simple and easy to grasp, whereas characters like Wraith are difficult to understand when their abilities are applicable or not.
Overall though, I appreciate that this game doesn't make it so you to use abilities to win but instead treats them as something you use if you need it.

-
I love this game's movement mechanics. Being based on the Source engine of all things it's no wonder this game has really satisfying movement mechanics. Moving around, flying off of a jump tower or just sliding down a slope feels and during fights - movement can either be the make or break of an encounter.
The only complaint in regards to movement I have concern a specific legend - Pathfinder & his standard grapple ability. Depth perception will be your worst enemy and you will be constantly fighting with the game on what is considered the appropriate distance away to initiate a grapple. Once you get the hang of it it's super satisfying but does it feel awkward initially.

This is a free-to-play game, it's natural that it has some monetization in it so that the developers can earn money from the product they've created. The one thing that has me pretty skeptical about this game is its publisher - EA - the worst possible one. Given this fact, how's the monetization in this game? Honestly I'm incredibly mixed on it. Lemme go into detail why.

-
The DLC is stupidly overpriced for what it offers & the Steam reviews reflect that. $30 to unlock every single hero is honestly a stupid price & the other DLC definitely barely offer anything worthwhile to the consumer. Honestly I'm hardly surprised that this is a thing given the publisher but it's just a shame altogether - I'd personally avoid the DLC if I were you unless it goes on a 50+% off sale at some point, if ever.

-
I think the lootbox system in Apex is pretty okay. I'm not condoning them being in here but their inclusion in this game is inoffensive at best. Apex Legends lootboxes offer 100% cosmetic items only of varying rarity with items ranging from crafting materials to use in the shop to weapon/character skins. From what I've gathered they don't do limited-time lootbox drops so they're avoiding making the consumer feel FOMO which is a welcome addition. In other words they're there if you want them but you can absolutely skip them if you do not with to engage with them at all and I really appreciate that.

-
This is one thing I actively dislike about this game's monetization system, purely because it just clickbaits you constantly with stuff like ""Reach Level 25 to unlock this skin"", only for you to reach Level 25 and the game tells you ""buy premium to get this skin!"", at which point I just wanna tell the game to ♥♥♥♥ off. The battle pass challenges themselves are fine but the rewards are underwhelming and the game keeps trying to drag you into buying the premium Battle Pass & I actively dislike that.

How are the other aspects of the game?

-
For being developed on the Source engine it surprises me how much they were able to accomplish using it. The game looks great. Not outstanding or stunning, but still visually appealing and eye-catching.
Some gripes would be that the game tends to struggle with loading graphics on time so often I found myself staring at insanely low res textures, only for them to slowly fade into the higher quality ones. It's not that big of a deal as it usually happened either during a loading screen or the character selection screen but still something I noticed regardless.

The sound & music of Apex is good. The guns sound great & the hitsounds are perfectly satisfying.
The music isn't anything outstanding - nothing that sticks in my mind so I don't really have much to comment. Great to have in the background during non-crucial situations but definitely something you can freely mute & forget about.
The voice acting is okay. Does the job & the actors do a good job portraying the character they need to.

I think the game could use some work in this department. I frequently notice random frame drops & also mentioned the texture-loading thing, but as a whole - the game doesn't seem to struggle maintaining a playable framerate, it's just that it likes to dip every so often and it is annoying.

There are more things I wanna talk about but I have to cut it due to the Steam character limit. Overall, Apex Legends surprised me being that it's satisfyingly fun, looks great but the monetization system & optimization could use some work. If you were on the fence about trying it - you should try it and see if you like it."

Apex is one of those games that I have to gaslight myself into playing. ""its not that bad"" ""this season is gonna be so much better"" ""the audio is fixed"" ""the SBMM is the best in any BR"" But as soon as i queue up into a game I find myself spending the next 45 minutes debating my own existence on this earth. The audio is trash, theres no point in playing against controller players, every season and event is a money grab, there is rarely any quality of life improvements, SBMM is actually worse than dog water, and you're miserable if you solo in any game mode. But, for some reason, like a toxic ex, ill be crawling right back trying to re-kindle the flame of enjoyment I once had when I played the game only to be absolutely disappointed then I'll go play Battlebit."
