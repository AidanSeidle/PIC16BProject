I won't give this a thumbs down because I did enjoy it. However $30AUD for about 3 hours of gameplay is pretty steep. I am hoping that there will be more content released."

It's so satisfying!

I really liked it, it's a beautiful, cute game but the playtime is just around 4 hours so i don't think it is worth the price, so I would suggest to buy it in a sale :("

It's a cute and relaxing game but it was surprisingly short. I feel like it ended abruptly.

Would be worth waiting and buying it on sale(more than 50% off) because it's pretty expensive imo for the amount of playtime you get.

I have 4.3 hours on here but I did go through a second time for achievements, so it's even shorter than that.

Apparently there's no intention of adding anymore to the game too which just pushes the fact that you should wait until a decent amount of money is off the game before you purchase it."

Great game but I wish there was a free-play mode with randomized rooms to unpack. As-is, the game feels a bit lacking in content. The story is cute and fun, but when I was through with it, I just felt disappointed, like there should have been more.

I'd say this game was worth the price if finishing the story unlocked some other game play modes or something, but it just... ends. And the replay value isn't very high. Once the story is done, that's just kinda it. No reason to leave it on your device, just uninstall and download something else.

Hopefully the devs add something more to this because the gameplay itself is great.

I'd only recommend getting it on a decent sale at this point because it's a very short a one-and-done right now."

Definitely a relaxing game, however 20$+ for barely 2-3 hours of gameplay is very overpriced. I wish there was more to it, especially since among the very few levels, some only have a room or two.

I'd love to see more levels in the future, or even unpack for a whole new family. Basically, this game needs more content before it's worth the price."
unpacking,Recommended,3.0,"Posted: November 2, 2021
The game took less than 3 hours to complete. I've been following the game for years so it's a little disappointing to be finished all the content in one little sitting.

Otherwise a great game. Very relaxing. Wonderful music.

I really hope that the game will be expanded."

The biggest negative to this game: far too short.
Unpacking is relaxing and fun, and tells a sweet story - nothing wild or huge, just the path of one person's life as they move. I enjoyed seeing what objects carried over through the years and what items got left behind or replaced. It was heartwarming to see how the person grew and what she achieved by looking through her things. I was a little disappointed that there was only this one story, however. Around 7 places to unpack, of varying lengths/difficulties, and then the game is over.

I received this game as a gift, but i do think $20 is a high price point for the 4 hours of game play. If the story struck a huge note with me or if there were different difficulties or things i could improve for replay, i might change my tune, but as it stands, after 4 hours i have seen what there is to see in this game. I would love if there were more levels, maybe based around a different person, or even if steam workshop could make custom levels or items so that players could create their own stories.

TL;DR : fun game, i recommend buying on sale."

Introduction:
Unpacking is a casual, very cosy little game that has you placing items about your in-game house. To describe it, it is actually very hard to make it sound interesting, and yet it is. I played the entire game in one sitting and wished there was more at the end. It’s a small gem – very cute, very casual, and very relaxing.


X Steep price for playtime. About 4 hours, for $15/£15. I’d wait for a sale.
X Short.
X Not particularly replayable.


+ Cute graphical style.
+ Achievements that are easy to get.
+ Nice background story.
+ Relaxing.
+ Easy to play.
+ Doesn’t require powerful hardware.

Unpacking has a very cute graphical style that is hard to place. Everything is made of pixels (I know that’s true literally but… you know what I mean). It is soft on the eyes, with a gentle colour palette and interesting environments. Rooms are probably tidier than anyone’s actually is in real life, but I soon saw to that.

I really enjoyed the visual style of this game. I think, like so much else about it, ‘cosy’ is an apt description. The only small flaw I could mention is that on some rare occasions, I couldn’t tell what an item was, and because everything is designed in ‘pixels’, zooming in didn’t help. This is not a massive issue though, I worked out what the items were in the end anyway. I only went around all of the rooms waiting for the game to accept a location placement for them…

The game works as if items are placed on an invisible grid of sorts. It is not restrictive at all, and so not a downside, but movement and placement of items isn’t completely ‘free’. They have to snap to positions on surfaces. Some of these items can only go on certain surfaces and the game will alert you to this after you have unpacked everything, but in the main you are free to place anything where you like, and so you are free to approach the gameplay as you like. Some will make everything neat, and take their time about it, while others only care about keeping the bed clear so they can go to sleep that night, even if you would have to be a contortionist to get through all the rubbish on the floor to get there.

As you progress in the game, your living spaces get bigger and so you no longer unpack in just one room. It expands to a whole house. You can cycle through scenes with buttons on the far sides of the screen, but there’s also a floor plan you can pull up from a button at the top that shows you all the rooms on that floor. If it’s a big house, it’s easier to do that, and I appreciate they added this feature.

The gameplay is relaxing, and though the process of unpacking is repetitive in as far as clicking and dragging items across a screen, it is made engaging both by the variety of items, the changing locations, and the background story. Some objects can be interacted with too, often triggering achievements. This adds a nice layer of intrigue beyond just making rooms look tidy. Unpacking never felt boring to play.

Unpacking is actually quite good at environmental storytelling. More than being just a game where you unpack boxes, if you pay attention to the items that you unpack and the varying houses you do it in, you slowly observe a story unfolding. It is surprising how real the story felt, too, despite the lack of dialogue or characters in the game. Each room you unpack becomes a snapshot in time of a person’s life, and as the game plays on you start to get a feeling for this person’s highs and lows as you can observe the behind the scenes of their story. This was an unexpected but very rich addition to the game, I felt.

The music in the game is quite retro, I think. Some of the tracks are quite acoustic and have a light-hearted, summery ethos about them, while others are a little more upbeat. If you have ever played visual novels, certainly those with a romantic plot, the music reminded me a bit of that. I really enjoyed the soundtrack to this game, it set the cosy atmosphere off well.

Some items in game make noises, such as the microwave, when you interact with them. Placing things on surfaces and opening cupboards and similar such actions triggers sound effects too. On the whole, they’re quite minimal, but it really did have me feeling like I was at home alone on a summer afternoon, joyfully unpacking and settling into my new house. It was a lot more stress-free than the real thing…

For those that enjoy unpacking, but who have nowhere to go, this is the perfect game for you. It removes the discomfort of jetlag, the terror of finding spiders have set up a hotel in your house while you’ve been away, and the annoyance of having mess all over the floors for days on end, and instead substitutes it with all the best there is in unpacking – a small window of time where you can let your mind wonder and happily place your belongings aesthetically around your home.

Unpacking is a simple game that is fairly short. The price is a little steep and there’s not much replay value, but it still manages to have a strong sense of atmosphere tell a nice story while offering relaxing and fun gameplay. I would wait for a sale to make it better value, but otherwise I highly recommend this game.

I am playing this game from Ukraine during the war time. I had to leave Kyiv, but my apartment back there is still decorated for Christmas. Also, right before war, my friend visited and we rearranged my shelves to look better. It was such a healing experience. I don't know why but unpacking someone's happy life helps to keep myself sane. It is... soothing. Comforting. Thank you."

A lovely game made by lovely people. The game play is relaxing, the music is great, and the art style is adorable.
There is however, one very large problem with the game. Its length.
I grapple with this issue a lot in gaming, artist should be able to charge what they see fit for their work and good art, even if small, should be worth it. But, the reality of it is that $20 can go much father and get you much much more on this platform, even from indie devs. The team can and should charge what they want, but after I realized after 3 hours I'd seen all there was to see, I can't lie, I was a bit let down. If there was more free content planned on the way I would be more understanding, but after some digging on the community page, the devs have flat out said that there isn't.

Long and short of it is, they should be able to charge what they want, but the shortness of the game, in MY opinion, paired with its price seems a bit unreasonable. Outside of that it is still a good game.
However, Games that have more to do and are cheaper on steam, by similar sized to even smaller teams are aplenty.
Grab this one on sale or if they lower the price. Or pay up. It's up to you."

This game is very adorable. I loved the bits and pieces that made the storytelling experience much more fun. The only issue is that for ~$20, there aren't many levels... I would love an update of another person's life, or the character getting older, etc.

unpacking,Recommended,3.4,"Posted: November 5, 2021
Harder to recommend but I do
The graphics are beautiful and the sound design and music aren't bad either.
I had a good time playing but as many others have pointed out it's quite short for the price with little to no replay value. Perhaps more game modes (like room design, competitive score based modes, an infinite or sandbox mode where you just unpack as much as you can into a set space, even just some extra levels, etc.) would lend it more longevity.

Having finished it I'm still not sure what some of the items were and it can be potentially irritating trying to figure out where things need to go at the end of a level when you don't know what they are so some item names/descriptions would be a handy addition if you hover over the item or once you've picked it up.

If you're looking for a zen experience you can lose yourself in that's not too long this is not a bad choice but I'd be inclined to wait for it to go on sale as it's quite pricey for what it is."

Overall I think Unpacking is a good game. It has a very cozy atmosphere and tells a sweet story, with an appealing art style and chill music. If you are looking for something not too challenging but still a logic puzzle of sorts to play after a day that's been just too demanding, Unpacking would fit the bill quite well.

My one big issue, same as many others have already said, is the price for the amount of content that is here. As of this review, I'm just under 4 hours of playtime, and I've already completed the game and unlocked every achievement, despite playing at a fairly relaxed pace. I would suggest getting this game on sale (ideally 50% off or better) if you are at all interested in it."
unpacking,Not Recommended,8.7,"Posted: November 20, 2021
Tl;dr: Wait for this game to go on sale.

The only reason I don't recommend this game is because it's extremely overpriced for what you get. It's very relaxing and it tells a heartfelt story of someone growing up and discovering themselves. But it costs twice as much as it should.

I completed the game in 3.5 hours then spent some time rewatching what I'd done to get to the 4.3 hours of play mark. There is little to no replay value, either, as it always tells the same story with the same items. I wish it had an endless/sandbox mode where it randomized items and room layouts, or let us choose the furniture or aesthetic of the items. As is, I enjoyed it, but feel I could have spent my money better elsewhere."
unpacking,Not Recommended,4.7,"Posted: June 5
This is a cute and enjoyable experience. It's nice to see the different ways people tackle a common task and something that would normally be a chore is turned into a fun and nearly exciting little game with its fun music and charming art style. For the 3 hours that it lasted, it was definitely interesting to unbox someone's life and perceive a story through their belongings.

However, this game is unfortunately overpriced. While I can always appreciate smaller developers joining the scene, it is also important to know how much an experience is worth. While captivating and intriguing, this game also offers minimal repeatability and does not provide an unforgettable time. The most notable feature of this game is the fact that it is unique, but would otherwise quickly lose it's charm the more that it is explored; especially as a genre.

I do recommend this game as it can be very fun for a marginally definite group of people, but for myself do I not believe it to be worth the amount I paid or the experience it provided. That being said, cool game!"

While the complaints of the game being rather short for the price do have some merit (taking my time to unpack each level and getting all of the achievements took a little under 4 hours), I still wouldn't trade this experience for the world. As advertised, this is a very zen puzzle game that has just enough 'puzzle' to keep it interesting while being more than 'zen' enough to make it a non-frustrating experience. While I very much enjoyed the gameplay aspect - the feeling of everything getting put in its place is just absolutely amazing beyond description - as well as the fantastically relaxing soundtrack, I was surprised by how much the storytelling aspect actually blew me away. Just all in all an absolutely fantastic experience, with a soft and sweet ending that genuinely made me cry, and I will undoubtedly be booting this up in the future to find new ways to unpack the rooms and relax in the future."

First and foremost... I think you may need a box of tissues - maybe. I certainly bawled my eyes out, maybe because it was in a way daunting at times thinking of actually being the person cramming yourself into someone else's tiny living space you now share... and then moving on... I cried hardest at the end, like a relieved, happy cry. It's so good. I am not normally one to write reviews but I think it's especially important for a tinier game like this.
You'll probably spend a few hours in this and maybe see some new things in someone's house you don't recognise, running from room to room trying to figure out ""why the hell did that go on top of the fridge?"". You won't mind, though. Please give this game a chance. It's ""environmental storytelling"" at a level you can interact with and be a part of. Lots of little fun things to look at and see what comes along each time.

All in all, I absolutely recommend this game. Perfect, bite-sized, and absolutely perfect for someone like me struggling to usually find more than 30 minutes for a game these days!! I had a blast!!!"

This game has become a relaxing escape for me. Whenever I'm having a bad day, I can replay this game over again. I'll put things away differently then before, and discover new hidden things.

On one hand the story the game tells through subtext feels sweet and complete. But on the other hand I can't say that I wouldn't love to see more content for a game like this. I could honestly probably play so many more hours if this game was expanded.

For example - it would've been wonderful to see the devs tell other people's stories too - with new locations, storage challenges, new items to unbox for the different personalities, hobbies, and styles - plus some new achievement stickers to go with it. For some reason - the idea of designing your own space and curating your own clothes and items also sounds like a hypothetically appealing addition to this game. But at the same time that kind of just sounds like I'm describing The Sims 4 Build & Buy mode - so maybe scratch that last idea.

It's just so satisfying, the devs have really itched a part of my psyche with this game, I don't know why but moving these 2D pixel art objects around a room is so calming. So I can't help but feel a bit disappointed that there won't be any new content for this wonderful game. But I still enjoyed the experience of playing it, and will no doubt play it again and again.

I've begun to feel like there could be a tiny little hole in the market for another game to come a long and create a similar experience that is more expansive. But even if that does happen, there will always be something special about Unpacking for me - it's charm is unforgettable imo.

While I personally would say it was worth the $20 I spent on it, some may not feel the same way - especially if there isn't as much replay-ability for them as there is for me. Cause the initial play through is rather short after all. So if your unsure I'd say wait till it's on sale."

I have not finished the game yet, but I was rooting for this young girl to get confident in her art.
As I was progressing through the years, seeing the place for her diploma being under her bed, having no desk to work or no real space for her really live killed me. I'm in 2015 now, you go girl, you're doing great, you got this. Your diploma is where is has to be, right on the wall, I'm glad it's there for people to see that you worked hard.

I know it's a game, but art is something that is often considered as a hobby and not a work, when you look at a piece of art for 3 seconds before going to the next, you don't see the hours poured in the piece, even less the years of work for this art to even exist.
Don't speak to an artist telling them they are gifted, like one day, they got ""art"" as superpower. They worked really hard for you to see that picture, read that book, watch that short, etc. Art is a work and deserve as much consideration as any other.

So for those who read this, I'm going to give you a challenge. When you'll have a look at a picture, don't scroll down quickly, give it at least 10 seconds and a like. If you're crazy, even share the art and make a comment. Those are what fuel the artists in confidence, this is what anybody practicing art needs along a huge cup of coffee.

This is such a nice little indie game, but seriously why such an expensive price tag? I got it 30% off (cheapest sale to date), and got only 5 hours of play time taking my sweet, sweet time. Game is honestly perfect at what it's trying to do and the environmental storytelling is cute, but jeez it's hard to justify such a steep price for such a short game.

This game is the masterclass of environmental storytelling. No I'm not kidding.

Unpacking is a charming, relaxing puzzle game.
Each level has the same goal, in a different location, you just moved in, and need to unpack and place your stuff. There is no time limit, just a homey soundtrack and the sounds of opening boxes and placing your items.
The puzzle aspect comes into play once you placed everything. The game wants certain items in certain places to complete a level. But this can also be disabled in the option, so you can place everything where you feel it’s best suited.
Through the different locations, which are separated by a couple of years each, and the items you unpack, Unpacking tries to tell its story and makes you think about what is happening in the life of the person you unpack the boxes for.
A perfect game, for when you just want to relax and calm down a for a bit :)"

The game is very relaxing, but it's extremely overpriced.

I have bought this game on sale, because I have heard how relaxing that game is and I thought with my anxiety disorder it might be a good idea to try it out. And in fact it did help me relax and it was fun to unpack the belongings of the person whose life you are following, to learn a bit about their life and story from childhood all the way into adulthood.
However I have finished this game in only a bit over 3 hours, where I did rather often not pay attention to the game due to having to leave my computer for a bit, and for a game that on sale still had cost me 12€ and has absolutely no replayability whatsoever, I genuinely feel like I have wasted my money a bit. I have paid less for games that had more gameplay to offer.

But the price aside, the game itself is very nice. As mentioned it is incredibly relaxing in my personal opinion, with some nice music and very pretty visuals. In general the art style is really sweet and the story you get to see is very heartfelt. Also you can place everything almost everywhere that you want, which makes it interesting to see the way other people unpacked everything.

So all in all, I can certainly recommend the game if you are after something very relaxing and super sweet. But simply not at that price, even when on sale."

Unpacking one’s belongings after moving to a new place could be a stressful operation, but it could also be a zen-like, nostalgic moment: you see your life condensed in a box, you reminisce upon the memories that each item brings up and you assign a new home on a shelf or in a drawer for each of these memory shards. Unpacking manages to capture these feelings perfectly, conveying a relaxing and evocative experience, and delivering a subtle and emotional story that is told solely through its gameplay and environment, without words.

Unpacking 
A Screenshot of Unpacking
By: 🍒 Lilly (🌸◠‿◠)

Each of the 8 levels in Unpacking represents a different stage in life and different living quarters to decorate. They spawn over a period of 21 years, starting from early childhood when the faceless protagonist first received her own room and ending in adulthood as a fully accomplished woman. As you pull the items one by one out of the boxes that are stacked in every room and find places for each of them, her life slowly unravels before your eyes: an ever growing collection of stuffed toys, a framed diploma here, an award later, some profession-related items that suggest an artistic career, or others that indicate the relationship status in that specific period of her life etc.

Apart from some specific cases, the objects are not interactive, and clicking them also doesn’t produce any text prompts but they subtly convey what happened in the time period between two sequential levels. I would normally think that reading a few carefully chosen words reflecting the thoughts triggered by picking up a certain item would be an enhancement to the gameplay, yet in it's vastly more satisfying to discover all the little details by yourself, and to assemble the whole picture from these pieces of information, like a jigsaw puzzle.


To some degree, the items have determined places or particular types of locations and after all the items are placed down, the ones with an incorrect positioning are highlighted with a red border. Rearranging things so that they fit in the spaces allocated is part of the gameplay and it also brings more realism to the game. For example, you don't know beforehand how many clothing objects you'll have to place in the wardrobe and how many available hangers there are, or how many books a certain collection has, therefore in the end you'll likely need to move some of the items around. For those that prefer more flexibility, the strict positioning of the items can be turned off from the option menu yet this diminishes the puzzle aspect of the game.

Aside from the obviously gorgeous pixel graphics and the chill, tranquil gameplay, the feature I liked the most in the game was the ability to watch a replay of a level at high speed, with all the movements I made while solving it. Additionally, this can then be exported into a gif or a video.


is not only a very relaxing game, but also a wholesome one and overall an extremely satisfying experience, especially for people like me, who enjoy living in an orderly environment. My only complaint about the game is that the asking price of $20 is too high for the 3-4h of fun that it offers - it would be great if more levels are added in the future and included in the same price, yet at the moment there’s no information about that. It does have some replayability value if you reset the levels, although replaying them does not bring anything new to the game. features Steam-integrated achievements, the majority of which are awarded for doing things a bit differently than what you’d expect, yet still extremely trivial to obtain (by placing some of the objects in some peculiar locations)."

I am super loving this game.
Already hooked, and am on the 4th level so far.
I love the cute pixel aesthetic, and it feels really calming to just choose where you want to place things, and in the end design the room the way you want it.
Only issue so far is some items are confusing where they can go; on the third level I couldn't hang my towel up in the Bathroom on an empty towel rack with the others, and instead had to place it in my wardrobe?? Same with my apron that I also put in the wardrobe instead of the Kitchen.
Played this while taking a break from studying for end of year exams, and it's super relaxing to play. Looking forward to playing this more after I finish them!
In the end, what the Devs have made here is a super fantastic and fun game, and I can't wait to see how well this game does in the future. Glad that my fellow Australians are in the limelight from this one."

I bought this game when it was on sale and it's a cute game with a charming story. It's relaxing to play, sorting items and building a home while watching someone's life play out but the game is EXTREMELY short. There's only so many different places the game lets you put items, so the replay value is limited and I believe 20$ is FAR to much to be asking for a game like this. I completed the entire game (100% completion with all achievements) in less than 4.5 hours. If you really want to play this game I would recommend buying it while it's on sale.

Not a bad game overall, but overpriced for how little game there actually is."

The game that proves unpacking can be a moving experience.

So what’s there to do in Unpacking? Unpack. Simple as that. Each level tasks the player with taking a series of boxes and emptying their contents, positioning them one-by-one in appropriate places around each room. These tasks start out simple, with the player needing to unpack only an individual room, and slowly progress into larger areas spanning an entire household. This is simple and flawless gameplay at its finest, one that developer self-describes as “zen block-fitting puzzle”. But it’s so much more than that.

The key gameplay concept of Unpacking is one that is innately human: moving house. Each room is initially bare, devoid of any sort of homeliness. Piece by piece, the player removes an item at a time from each box and can position them in any spot around each room. Although it might be entertaining to put a stuffed toy on the toilet (toylet?) or hide a Gameboy under your pillow, every item has its appropriate place to call home. During the level you’ll be given the freedom to place items wherever you wish, but upon unpacking all the items the player may be prompted that some don’t quite align with the room’s aesthetic. So you’d better put that toilet roll where it belongs, and make sure to move all those dirty cups out of your bedroom while you’re at it.

Zen is exactly the perfect descriptor for this style of gameplay. There is no time limit, no pressure, and really very little element of stress or challenge. Players may proceed at their own pace, taking time to appreciate their surroundings, slotting each new item into their new home. This slow-paced gameplay becomes especially important when admiring the game’s stunning visuals, which hold an impressive amount of detail and are full of clever references and nods to pop culture.

Story

Taking a back seat in Unpacking, much of the story is left up to the interpretation of the player. Cleverly presented across a series of levels, the player experiences a lifetime of unpacking from childhood bedrooms through to independent adulthood. Each stage begins with the year in which it is occurs, setting the scene for the gameplay that follows. Once completed, a photograph of the completed room is taken and lovingly stuck into to a photo album with a short comment explaining the situation.

Although the presentation of Unpacking’s story is done in such a minimalist style, Witch Beam manage to expertly convey a convincing sense of raw human emotion. I can’t go into significant detail in discussing the story that unfolds, but there are moments where this game will make you feel deep sadness, conflicting regret, and an overwhelming sense of joy. There are many elements of the game that I’m sure that players will be able to relate to their own experiences of moving house, as there are many themes that resonate with what it means to be human.

Visuals

Realism and pixel art harmoniously unite in Unpacking, which offers a detailed and vibrant pixel art aesthetic that is among some of the best to date. Don’t expect the blocky 8-bit or 16-bit pixel art that many other indie games lean towards; this is pixel art that imitates real life. From the designs of houses and rooms all the way down to its smallest contents, the visuals of Unpacking are not only highly-detailed and realistic, but carry an underlying charm to every item that is delicately moved out of its box.

If you consider yourself a geek, the art in Unpacking will appeal to you on so many levels. Rooms are crammed with electronics, Monster Manuals, lovingly-crafted miniatures, and even half-finished cosplay outfits that adorn mannequins. Throughout every minute of gameplay I found myself needing to stop and admire the intricate details, like deliberately-crafted videogame consoles, game and DVD cases that perfectly capture real-life cover art, adorable sets of plush toys, and even the beauty of the simplest day-to-day items like toiletries and stationary. Items may even change as they are brought along to several locations, becoming worn or weathered over time like an old mouse pad or a treasured stuffed toy.

Audio

Pixel art calls for chiptunes, but just like Unpacking’s incorporation of realism in its visuals, so too does it add real life to its music through the use of many instruments. The core foundation of the soundtrack is a chill synth with chiptunes to carry the melody, harmoniously interwoven with a mix of acoustic guitar, funky bass, and even some solemn piano for the game’s more poignant moments. Gorgeous tunes from Canadian-Australian composer, Jeff Van Dyck, set the mood for the rest of the game.

But it’s not just the music of Unpacking that will delight your eardrums, there are minute details throughout to impress any audiophile. For example, picking up and placing every single item in the game is accompanied by a unique sound effect depending on the object and surface on which it is placed. There’s a great degree of detail to the sound design – even to the point of hearing game discs rattle in their case when placed on a shelf, or the satisfying thud of a book laid face down. Environmental cues too remind you clearly that the game is taking place in subtropical Australia, with background chattering of Rainbow Lorrikeets and whistling of Honey Eaters while leaves calmly rustle in the wind. So satisfying.

Extras

Outside of the main game, which will take approximately 4 hours to complete, the game has some extra content to keep players coming back for more. Each level has some hidden secrets when placing an item in a peculiar or perfect spot – doing so will reward the player with a sticker and an achievement. These stickers can be used in the game’s photo mode, where the player is given access to all sorts of filters and adjustments to showcase that game’s beautiful art. I spent quite a bit of time in the photo mode, which can produce some pictures that are truly wallpaper-worthy.

Conclusion

There are few games I’ve played that I can say are truly beautiful, heart-warming and touching, but Unpacking is all that and so much more. Such a simple gameplay concept not only manages in itself to be incredibly entertaining and strangely satisfying, but when combined with detailed pixel art and themes of human emotion, manages to become almost poetic. Even the simplest moments of the game have the ability overwhelm the player with joy and happiness. This gameplay is one that could have great impact – I’d personally love to see it applied to different situations, like those less fortunate who have been driven out of home for reasons beyond their control.

Witch Beam have created a game unlike any other I’ve played, and if you are a human with a heart, I implore you to experience it as well. Unpacking truly is a moving game in every sense of the word.

So, why should you play it?
- Simple, elegant, and satisfying gameplay.
- Stunning and detailed pixel art.
- Plenty of clever pop-culture references.
- Deeply emotional story despite minimal dialogue.
- Impressive attention-to-detail through audio design.

But why shouldn’t you play it?
- Players looking for a lengthy experience may be dissatisfied.
- You’ve only ever lived in one place and have never had to unpack.

Yes, it costs 20 moneys and there are games that will run you for a lot longer than Unpacking for that price. But do those games let you organize underwear by colour? Do they let you organize books by size? Do they let you put all your man's clothes under the bed while you take over his wardrobe? ♥♥♥♥ up his colour coded kitchen with your ugly appliances? I don't think so. If this game isn't for you, it's just not for you, go spend those 20 moneys on an anime girl on a gacha or something. This game is for ME.

Absolutely lovely style and game play is cute. I did really feel like I got to know the character. However, the reason I cannot recommend this game is because it lasted only 3 hours!

Cute art and story, however, I finished it in under 3 hours. Which for me is NOT worth $20. If it were a mediocre game I'd pay $4.99, but since it's cute I'd still say they're charging double what it's worth. Feels like a robbery honestly.

Ignore playtime. I played it in offline mode.

Many will scoff at the $20 price tag but I can see the love and devotion put in the game. Sound design and pixel design isn't easy, even in this day and age. The developers put in a crazy amount of sound effects so that putting items in various areas spots makes a different sound. I would certainly hope the $20 contributes to paying the developers, sound artists, and graphic artists a a good wage for their effort in this.

The game is charming and relaxing. The only complaint that I have about the game is that it's short. I certainly would love to see more, as in a different story with different items or something similar to that. The game can be a little finicky when it comes to the placement of different items but it's not hard to figure it out where it needs to go. But sometimes it can feel like it's a bit of a puzzle game to ensure that you're arranging things properly so that everything has its place.

If you're a stickler for organization, there's certainly a chance that you're playing the game a lot longer than average, but it will certainly tickle your categorizing/organizing fancy.

If you enjoy incredible pixel art, this game is for you.
If you're looking for something relaxing and laid back, this game is for you.
If you like organizing and arranging, this game is for you.

To me, it's worth the price. Especially if it means that there's an opportunity for more of this game or a sequel or something. I just want more of this!

All in all 8.5/10"

I love the concept, and most of the game play is reasonably enjoyable. What super ruined it for me though is how certain items need to be placed in very specific rooms or places in rooms..

That journal? No, you can't place it on the shelf or desktop, it must go IN THE DRAWER.
That small trashcan? No, that can't go in the bathroom, that's supposed to be in the bedroom..
That game/movie case? No, you can't put that on the coffee table, that needs to go on the shelf!
That laundry basket? No, you need to move it ONE SPACE CLOSER TO THE LAUNDRY ROOM CLOSET THING.

As soon as I realized the game was gonna tell me where certain things had to go and I wasn't really quite as free to place things how I wanted, the rest of the levels became a slog to quickly place things wherever they were probably wanted to I could get the little ""this needs to be placed somewhere else"" outline so I could finish the level."
