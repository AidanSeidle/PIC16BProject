I genuinely enjoy the game, but I feel that it is morally incorrect to recommend the game to others and downright evil to recommend the game to friends. The game itself is fun, and the skills and combat can feel very satisfying. Each of the many jobs offers a different play-style so players have some options with how they want to interact with the game.

The problem is that the game feels fun and inviting at first, but as soon as you start thinking ""Wow, I like this character, I wanna see how far I can go with it,"" Nexon has already won.

First, you have to get a character from level 1 to level 200. This will take a few days at first, but each character you do this with will take a shorter amount of time to reach level 200. If the first climb to level 200 already felt too grindy, I recommend stopping immediately because it will get much, much worse.

Each of the different jobs have a special skill called a ""Link Skill."" For some job, these link skills have only 2 levels. Getting level 1 in a link skill requires getting the character to level 70, and getting level 2 in a link skill requires getting the character to level 120. Some characters have a third level to their link skill which is gained at level 210.

Link skills are special in that they can be transferred or ""linked"" to another one of your characters in the same world. The character that the link skill comes from always has that link skill active whether it's linked to another character or not.

So if there is more than one job that you enjoy, you can have those characters give each other some link skills to make them a bit stronger. You may swap out link skills among your many characters up to 10 times per day, but after changing out a particular link skill 3 times, you have to spend some in-game currency if you want to swap that skill another 1 to 7 times.

Another mechanic of the game is called ""Legion."" You're given a special board called the Legion board, which looks like, and is, a large grid. You're also given a number called your legion rank. Your legion rank is equal to the combined total of all your levels on each character in a particular world. As you level up a character, its levels are added to your legion rank. Additionally, at certain level thresholds, you are given a ""legion block"" that represents that particular character. These blocks look like and work similarly to Tetris pieces.

These blocks can occupy a number of spaces on the legion board depending on the character's level. At level 60 a block can occupy one space, at level 100 a block can occupy two spaces, at level 140 a block can occupy three spaces, at level 200 a block can occupy four spaces, and at level 250 a block can occupy five spaces.

The legion board has spaces that grant stats when legion blocks are placed on them. So, for example, if you place a block with a size of 3 in the ""Str"" or ""Strength"" region of the board, each of your characters on that world will gain a flat +3 str or strength to their stats. Additionally, each character provides its own legion bonus that also depends on the number of spaces that it takes up on the board. For example, a Hero class will give a flat +10, +20, +40, +80, and +100 strength at levels 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively.

""Flat"" means that the stats gained aren't affected by any other modifiers.

Each of these legion ""bonuses"" that a particular character provides can only be gained once. So if you get two Hero classes to 100, the strength bonuses from that particular class won't stack and will only be counted once.

So now that I've taken the time to explain Link Skills and Legion, why should these systems matter with whether or not the game should be played?

Here's the problem: Reaching ""endgame"" or somewhere close to it in this game essentially means getting every possible class to either level 200 or level 210. Level 200 when the character has a level 2 link skill, and level 210 when the character has a level 3 link skill. This is to get every character to provide at four spaces minimum on the legion board while also getting every link skill to its maximum level.

Levels 200+ are usually considered to be where ""real game"" starts nowadays, and pushing just a single character from 200 to 250 takes considerable effort, to the point where getting a level 5 legion block with every character could be considered a lifetime achievement.

Getting a character beyond 250 (the level cap is currently 300) is generally only feasible with about 3-4 characters at best, so most a lot of emphasis is placed on about 1-2 characters, which are a player's ""mains.""

You need to get every character to 200 or 210 in order to funnel the majority of your time, energy, and resources into one single character.

And that's all before mentioning that most of the content is massively time-gated, enhancing equipment to be suitable for late-game or end-game is ""pay-to-win"" in regular worlds, and cosmetics you buy with REAL MONEY from the cash shop only last 90 DAYS. That's right, you don't get to keep the digital cosmetics that you spent money on.

You CAN get permanent cosmetics by purchasing and opening the ""Surprise Style Boxes"" (SSBs) in the cash shop, but it's completely random which cosmetic equipment you'll get. You could potentially spend hundreds and not get the cosmetics that you want from a particular ""SSB"" rotation. The same thing goes for royal hair and face coupons. If there's a particular hairstyle or face style you want and it's listed on a royal hair/face coupon? Gotta roll for it.

I play the game because I don't mind grinding and sometimes even enjoy it while listening to music. It's something I kinda do mindlessly when I want to relax for a while.

I love the lore of this game and I'm usually excited to learn new bits of info about it. The story and writing is often cheesy and silly, but I think that's part of its charm. The music in this game can be repetitive, but personally I don't really get tired of it and find some tracks to be relaxing and/or awesome. The combat can be very satisfying and a lot of fun. The game makes you feel powerful as you take down swarms and swarms of enemies per attack.

I think the game itself is fine and even enjoyable and fun. There's simply no other 2d game, or mmo that feels quite like maplestory, and that's why some players find it to be so difficult to leave. There are parts of it that I love and genuinely enjoy, but it's plagued by subtle and extremely predatory monetization practices and a company that goes to any lengths that it can to exploit and take advantage of the player-base. Nexon simply does not care about the players in the slightest, and tries to pretend that they care whenever something happens that might affect the money they're making.

To summarize: It's a great game plagued by a terrible company and terrible pay-to-win practices, and getting further and further in the game requires exponential levels of grinding.

I feel I must re-iterate that I feel that to recommend this game to others is to subject them to the same issues that the current player-base is dealing with and as such would be morally questionable.

Recommending the game a friend and having that friend actually get into and enjoy the game might end up ruining their life with the levels of grinding this game requires, and as such I think to do that to a friend would be downright evil.

If you read all this and think you'd be fine with it, then proceed, but again I CANNOT and WILL NOT recommend this game to others.

Enter at your own risk."

Just don't.
I know you're a veteran, but the game you once loved is gone.

Enjoy a dying buggy game with unbelievable server issues, plagued by a skeleton crew of a company operating on the soul purpose of exploiting you for your nostalgia.

You wanna progress? Fork over thousands of dollars, or spend literal years to try and catch up to people still doing years old content because they don't add any catch up mechanics outside of trashy events that are usually just copy paste of the same ♥♥♥♥ with a slightly different flavor.

The literal only reason there are still players is because of sunk cost fallacy and addiction.

IF you don't want to fort over the thousands of dollars to even begin the game on regular servers, you can choose to play on reboot and deal with the most annoying RNG filled trash systems without any ability to trade, so you're forced to grind for years to hit what some people would consider to be late game. It's a mobile game on steroids.

I have a thousand hours on steam, but probably 4x that on the Nexon launcher over the years. I'm still not even in the late game. Hell, I'd say I'm closer to being in the mid game still. No thanks.

I just got word from my old guild discord that they have the audacity to charge $100.00 (ONE HUNDRED) dollars for an in game pet, then on top of the $100.00 charge, they have the audacity to charge $15.00 MONTHLY just to use the thing.
""But why would anybody pay so much money for a pet? That's insane.""
Because this pet vacuums up all the items and money on the floor, increasing your efficiency. So if you want to have any chance of keeping up with the whales you gotta fork over the cash on both your main, and most likely you will want a Kanna alt so you gotta fork it up on that character too.

I do not recommend this game. I wouldn't even consider this a game, it's just a glorified gambling simulator, where you don't just gamble with your wallet, you do it with your time on top of that."

Nexon ruined Maplestory. My account got hacked and after contacting support on two separate occasions, I was told this was why it was banned and it wouldn't be unbanned. I was then told by support, ""Continued appeal to this account will be considered abuse of our support system, and may result in the removal of your ability to contact us.""

If you haven't already been playing this game for years don't bother picking it up. It is absolutely not fit for new players who aren't willing to put in hours upon hours of out of game research and even more hours of grinding to get to even an early game level. You will spend many hours getting your first character to level 200-205 and then realize that this character is worthless without 7-8 more characters getting to level 120 for a few decent link skills and then even more to 140 so that you can start building up legion. Most of the bosses you unlock getting to level 200 are borderline not doable without first getting a boss carry to get the gear that they drop to even do enough damage to start contributing in boss fights that drop the gear that you need. They set the game up to almost require boss carries but are currently testing out nerfs to the boss carry system as an extra ♥♥♥♥ you to its players. The game design is entirely based around grinding for low drop chance items from weekly bosses and mesos used to buy cubes to make that gear better along with an upgrade system designed to destroy your rare items to force you to grind again. Nexon is entirely out of touch with its community and makes stupid wide reaching changes on a whim even after explicitly stating that they wont (ie: totem removal). Nexon is consistently saying that players are progressing too fast compared to how long they think progress should take and start making changes to make the game even worse and grindier They are completely willing to neuter classes for no reason and remove many BiS items from the game making them completely unobtainable for anybody but veteran players who happened to pick it up before the removal. I genuinely believe that Nexon dislikes its community to a point where it is actively trying to drive players from its game by constantly making ♥♥♥♥♥♥ changes that make the overall player experience worse. I used to love this game I have so many fond memories of playing growing up and Nexon has done everything in its power to piss on those memories and make the game completely unrecognizable. ♥♥♥♥ you Nexon

Edit: Nexon just announced today that they are outright removing the Jett class from the game entirely. Jesus ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Christ Nexon are you purposely killing any tiny shred of good will you had from your community by displacing thousands of characters and people who loved this class? I guarantee whatever compensation they have for this change wont even come close to matching the time and effort Jett mains have spent leveling and gearing their characters. But let me guess 100 free nodestones and 100 free symbols that will hold them over. ♥♥♥♥ YOU AGAIN Nexon"

For claification sake, I've played this game since Beta and I love the overall animation and playstyle imaged as a 2D platformer. I guess this really hit a nostalgia nerve for me and my yearning for the old Mario Brothers mechanics. And while I hate to bash something I fell in love with, this is no longer the game that I use to know.

Back in the early days of MapleStory, you had your 4 standard classes: Mage, Warrior, Archer, Thief. Mage and Warrior had 3 subsets each; Archer and Thief had 2 subsets. Finding equipment and hanging out with friends was easy because there was just a few servers and not that many maps. The level cap was set as a crazy 200, but the mindless grinding wasn't so bad, cause you could easily be with your friends and if you found an equip you couldn't use, one of them could and vice versa.

But Maplestory grew. On the surface, you would think this is a good thing; more people = more friends = more equips. True, but Nexon saw this as an excellent opportunity to milk its players through microtransactions.

As the game grew, Nexon built more servers and maps, creating virtual spacial rifts between players. It became more and more difficult to get to the same map as a friend without using a teleport rock (a microtransaction item) or wasting a bunch of time. Nexon created pets, vanity items, world transfers, shops; all for real money. When that wasn't enough, they created more character types, those who couldn't share the cash shop items with the original characters, essentially urging players to rebuy cash items. The new characters also lead to the nerfing of some of the original characters under the guise of ""improved"" for rebalancing issues. Nexon raised the level cap to 250, milking players for even longer. They created a lottery system called gachapon for in-game items using real money, not to mention special event ""lotteries"".

Don't play Maplestory. It's not what it use to be. The fun is sucked out of it. Don't waste tons of time and money on it like I did."

MapleStory was one of the first MMORPG titles I've had the chance of playing, besides Runescape Classic (which was a looong time ago).

After a revisit of this game (after many years of on and off playing), as well as THOUSANDS of dollars spent, I cannot say I am willing to recommend this game.

FIrstly, MapleStory is one of the few 2D side-scrolling MMORPGs that try to mix 'cute' and 'breathtaking' together, and at times, they do it very well. Some landscapes are huge, the original lore and locations were very well done, and one can be trapped in the game's beauty for long periods of time. Heck, even getting lost in that game was fun. However, with the changes as of the last two to three years, a lot of the beauty has been lost. In order to cater to the broader generation of players who demand instant gratification, they have changed out most of the old expansive locations and replaced them with compacted versions - so that players can traverse the world much more quickly. However, by doing so, they've stuffed all the game's content into the newer maps, which makes most of the world appear small and claustrophobic.

The music score for this game is wonderful. Whether you're inside the forests of Ellinia, or exploring the depths of Ludibrium, the background music really amplifies the mystery and beauty the game world is trying to become.

The original MapleStory had a handful of classes, and each of them were unique, but overall balanced. Now, each large 'class update' seems to focus on newer 'Hero' characters, most who severely outclass the older counterparts in terms of damage and flashiness. In fact, there are so many different 'Heroes' nowadays, it saddens me to say that you'll rarely run into the older classes anymore, except in the case of Legacy worlds.

The Cash Shop isn't all too great either. In addition to the standard cosmetic items and EXP boosts that one would commonly find in Free-2-Play MMOs, there are also items which give you in game currency, some which would offer you lowered failure chances when upgrading items. The latter gives players who spend a huge lead over players who don't, and this is made obvious by the overly high prices those items fetch on the marketplace.

Combine that with a marketplace that doesn't let players open one without forking cash (and depending on how much cash you're willing to spend, it also determines whether you'll have to stay logged in to sell items)(players are only able to trade, so they'll have to solicit people in the market entrances) and a bad support team, I truly cannot recommend this game to anyone. MapleStory's golden days are long gone, and what's left is a carcass of what was once a masterpiece."

You know when you see the family at dinner at a restaurant and all of the kids are on their iPads and no one is talking? That's a lot like this game now. It's all about instant satisfaction, and a completely dead community. Yes, I did play Maplestory back in its prime (2005-2008), and yes I am bias, but this game is not for you if you are looking for the original Maplestory. Who knows, maybe if I never played this game before, I would think it is great. It's up to you, there are still some cool things about it. You do your own thing, level up super fast, do some bosses. I love the art style still, but Maplestory now feels super lonely, and nothing you do is rewarding anymore. I haven't died a single time (and yes i have more hours than you see on steam here, I've played 70+ hours a year back not through steam). Nothing is challenging, the game is total instant gratification that dissipates very quickly. There are no specific roles to the class you choose because every class does a ton of damage and has mob control. I digress... You can still have fun on this game, but if you are coming back expecting this game to be the Maplestory you knew back in the day, do not try it (this is an opinion not a fact, do what you want). If you're looking for a lonely grind game that is calming and comforting, this may be a game that you like. Try it and see. It's free to play, so try it and make your own opinion. I'm going to vote positive because I don't think it's a bad game, it's simply not my style like it once was."

The game looks and sounds amazing, but I don't think there's anything positive I can say about the gameplay.

Having played for years, I've seen Nexon devolve into a sad Cookie Clicker design philosophy. The game is now designed for you to sit in one place, on one map, holding the attack button for hours on end maybe with one or two other people, then change to a different map every couple levels and repeat the process. Or, heck, just pick one of the new characters with skills designed to kill everything on the screen indefinitely so you can literally AFK, then brag when you reach the max level with your Kanna by AFKing in a town and asking for +Fame because there's nothing else to do in the game but grind.

All character build variety has been removed so there is now only an illusion of player customization. The new content that gets added amounts to too many convoluted collect-a-thon holiday events and non-MMO subgames that no one asked for. Every now and then there's a story arc with animation and subpar English dubbing, which I don't begrudge them for trying, but big dramatic story arcs weren't what made this game popular. New incomplete features are added before old ones they started years ago are finished--the game has two bestiaries right now, both of which are buggy and incomplete. And that's not even to mention the broken quests, redundant maps, and frequent crashes.

No, from a game design standpoint, this is a mess. I'll admit I keep coming back to the game because the nostalgia is strong, but... as a critic delivering a critical analysis, I can't recommend this game."

I've played this game since I was 10 years old when it came out in america.

The best way to describe maplestory is a deep, deep hole out in the woods.
When you are bored and looking for something to do you fall into this hole.
At first you are scared, you panic and try to get out of the hole.
But slowly, you begin you like it in the hole.
You spend thousands of dollars on making this hole cooler, nicer, and do more dps.
You meet friends, lovers, and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ inside of this hole, it begins to feel like a community.
Then high school girl drama will go down, and you will sell all your gear and quit.
You will struggle to climb out of this hole. And finally....you're out.

You go back to the way your life was before, and you become happy again.

After a couple of months...you feel this craving...this...hunger...
You miss the hole. Sure, the hole has its ups and downs...but you...you were safe in the hole...you were...home...
So you go back, and thus begins the never ending downward spiral of your life.

I would never recommend this game to anyone:
1. This game is dead. Don't see any new players except for those new characters from old players trying to make ""legion""
2. The game mechanic is totally trash: Everything is random except your the chance of you booming your items which is already ridiculously hard to obtain. Want to get item? roll random boxes. Want to get stronger? Roll random stats. What are the chance to get what you want? 0.01%. How much you pay 2$ each roll. Money come from trees I guess.
3. Requires hours of farming/day and still doesn't get you anywhere because everything is so expensive. Funded players do solo bossing leave people with no gears cant progress. You CAN NOT play this game without spending your money (unless you are willing to spend years on it to be 1/6 of 3 months funded players).
4. Game bugs, game crashes
5. Not new players friendly.
6. Poor description of everything. From guide to the quest or event, items. I believe Indian people have even better English skills.
7. 30% success, 70% failure 0.7% destroy the item and you know what. its 100% hit on 0.7%. This feels like a scam
Tons more reason not to play this game."

I remember waking up as a kid, excited and eager to start up my dad's computer, hopping into the world of Maplestory, ready to take on whatever the game was going to throw at me that day. Needless to say, I was hooked. The cartoony yet oddly satisfying visuals, the huge world that was set before me, the deceptively simple class system, all things that I adored about it. For a while, I couldn't get enough of this game. It was my first MMO ever, and, to this day, probably still my favorite. Nothing comes close to the fun I had while killing mushrooms in the starting zone, slaying Balrogs on airships, destroying robots in Ludi, and finally, conquering Zakum. I made many friends, joined a slew of guilds, and mostly, just had fun. That's what videogames were about back when I played Maplestory, and in a sense, it seems like they've kind of lost that recently, although that's a different topic entirely. Maplestory now seems to be much more oversaturated in terms of classes and things to do, actually making it an overwhemingly experience rather than an extremely enjoyable one, one that I had when I played. Needless to say however, I still had a HUGE amount of fun with this game, and is hands-down one of the best experiences, if not THE best, I've had in gaming. I cannot speak to the community now, but when I was playing, it was a bunch of generous and fun loving people, one's that were willing to help others when they needed it. I miss Maplestory, specifically old Maplestory, even more specifically v.066, when things were simpler and I had a bunch of NX to spend on a different hairstyle.

I miss you Maplestory.
Thanks for giving me the game of a lifetime."

This game has the potential to be great. The concept of a 2D MMORPG that's all animated is pretty cool, and there's a lot of charm in this game. I currently have a level 230 Kinesis in Reboot (I use nexon launcher instead of steam) and I've (somewhat) enjoyed the grind up to that point. The community at least in the server I play in is large and thriving. However, this game has major problems that's been in the game for as long as I can remember.

Pros:
- Tons of options in terms of which class/job you want to play with + no big loss of time if you change your main (passive benefits for each char you play)
- Great and flashy animation for a lot of moves, some of the characters you can play can feel extremely fluid
- Customization options are massive (comes with a catch mentioned in cons)
- Large community
- Constant updates and events are happening

Cons:
- Tons and tons and tons of bugs (I cannot stress this enough), includes: buggy bossfights, broken UI, frequent game crashes, possible false ban, very laggy servers (in reboot, idk how it is in other servers)
- Non-reboot servers: very p2w, Reboot servers: overwhelmingly grindy
- Cosmetics is expensive/not worth the price: getting the look you want is based on rng a lot of times or it's time limited
- Nexon
Let me elaborate on the last point in the cons section. This company has been overwhelmingly incompetent when it comes to developing Maplestory. The company has been making extremely controversial balancing decisions for the game, as if they are purposely trying to slow down progression so as to increase the amount of money players have to put in this game. They have no transparency whatsoever. They often change the game without mentioning it in patch notes. They have also done nothing to fix the known problems of the game that has been here for the longest time.

My main point of this review is, if you want to play for nostalgia's sake or just to try it out as a completely new player, go for it. It's a nice experience to try this game (if you get lucky and don't get bugged out), and you can clearly see the charm this game has. However, I would STRONGLY recommend NOT to play this game if you are looking for a game to spend a lot of time in. Nexon has shown little to no interest in listening to the community and they probably never will. You would be better off playing in a different game where the company actually cares about their community and things are hell of a lot more polished than this game is."

I played Maple Story the very first day it was released to North America and since then the game has changed a ton.
The grind in the game was hard but when you got them levels you earned them and it was amazing hearing the stories of guys like Tiger making top Teir and Wizet really loved it's community. Normally in the old maple story you would see admins walking around talking to members as they passed by and it was exciting to see the community with their passion for the game making content like Dray86's Maple Kombat.

Then came Nexon who montized the hell out of the game, took the world that everyone loved and threw it all over the place then they made these hero classes that made the orignal classes completely useless of which had the most insanely high damage you've ever seen. Many of the cool dungeons in maple story became empty which is really sad because they was excellent.

Sadly maple story degressed into this sub par kind of game. I want Wizet back, I want my maple story.

Do I recommend it to you? No, Nexon is a greedy company but you won't really noticed how screwed up the game is unless you was there from the start. You won't notice all the cool stuff taken out because they'll try to blind you with high numbers and stupid classes to ego stroke your ♥♥♥♥."

After 3k hours on Steam and more on the Nexon client I think I can finally say that this is not the game I used to love.
As much as you and I want the old Maplestory back, it won't happen.

You'll probably enjoy the game for the first day or two, until you realise that all the enjoyment is gone and the RMT sucking machine that Nexon is starts crawling up your wallet with their expiring Cash-Shop items and absurd subscriptions such as VAC-Pets. (90€ ??? + 14€ per Month).
Nexon perfected the art of FOMO (Fear of missing out), forcing you to play more, more characters, more hours, more of everything you don't enjoy but MUST, else you miss out on your gear that is relevant for 4 months before something new and shiny comes out. Over and over again.


Please don't do it to yourself and try finding something else to play. Playing nothing is probably a better choice than downloading and starting this game."

I honestly enjoyed this game ever since I started this game as a kid back when it first came out like in 2007 or so on global. I used the same account, linked it to Steam, and returned occasionally to play whenever a big event is being held like Hyper Burning. But now my yearly routine ended after getting a random auto ban for ""suspicious activity for hacking and botting.""

All I do is dailies and weekly bosses on my burning character. And right now they have some star event where you just sit on the chair and AFK for 30 minutes. Which I did, while alt-tabbed playing a different game or browse the web only to get auto banned. I tried to appeal and their senior GM said i violated their Terms of Use. I kept trying to get it sorted out but all the junior GMs refused to help and said their senior GM already checked my ticket and denied me. Absolutely no help in proving my innocence because my character just leveled off of dailies and only used event rewards.

Awful way to quit a game but its just depressing how I can get treated this way after playing the game legit for so long.

Also the nexon account linked to my Steam account will haunt me forever lol."

Maplestory is like an abusive relationship.
Ever since I was a wee young lass, back in 2007, I've been unable to stay away, and I have no clue why. Sure, nostalgia is the main factor, but there are so many other games I played back then that don't keep me coming back as often. No matter how many times I uninstall it, it ends up on my computer again sometime between a few months and a year later. I've never even made it far; most of the time I get a character to level 50 and see some other shiny class I want to try out, and so I have quite a few 1/5th leveled characters that I can never seem to get past level 50. And yet I keep coming back.
10/10 would have no clue why I still play this game again"

I remember playing this game since I was maybe 6 or 7 years old and let me tell y'all, it was AN AMAZING EXPERIENCE. I remember the days of dexless assassins, strength mages and MANO. Remember when old time Maplestory required you to walk all the way to the corresponding town to the job that you wanted to be because you didn't make enough meses fighting snails and orange mushrooms on Maple Island? Remember when you wanted to be a warrior and then walking up to Perion, you got f*cked by a Jr. Boogie?

Yeah this Maplestory No longer exists

You know what this new Maplestory is now? It's now revolved around you basically making every single class in the game and leveling them up to 250 if you want to min max the sh*t out of the game because they provide some pretty dam crucial Link Skills which can be equipped to your other characters for bonus exp, damage, stats, etc.. Okay, maybe you don't have to get every class to 250, but, there are multiple classes where you need to level them up, in order for making other classes even easier to level.

Okay, maybe this doesn't seem to bad itself and maybe you like leveling other classes and experiencing their other skills, THAT'S FINE. It starts to get extremely tedious, when just about everything you want to do requires you to actually ""progress"" in the game. I put quotations around progress because the way that you progress in this game is by raising your main stat for whatever class you are playing.

NOW HERE'S WHERE THE BULK OF THE GAME STARTS. You've spent countless hours leveling multiple characters to 140, but now on your ""Main"" you really need to start pushing levels and getting stronger. Guess what? You need to basically GAMBLE to increase your stats. Look up CUBING, this mechanic in my opinion is relatively ""okay"", but the real struggle is STAR FORCING you godam equipment. Okay gambling? to increase the strength f your equipment? Hey guess what? IT'S GODAM TERRIBLE, I have a level 238 Buccaneer doing dialies/weeklies as well as a hyperburning 241 shadower doing dailies/weeklies. This is including bosses, I had procured around 10 billion mesos, for some thats a lot, for other veteran players, those are rookie numbers. From my perspective, this is 1 and ahalf months worth of work, I've been saving up because I knew there was a STAR FORCE event coming up. I will not waste time explaining any further because other players know the struggle. I SPENT ALL THAT MONEY TRYING TO STAR FORCE MY CRA TOP AND BOTTOM FROM 17 STARS TO 20 STARS, A MEASLY 6 STARS IN GENERAL. Sure okay some players will say that's some small amount I saved, but guess what? I SPENT A MONTH AND A HALF PREPARING. All to get a measly what, 400 extra main stat? And guess what? that's not even the end of trying to rank up your gear, I didn't explain it clearly earlier, but it costs yo MONEY to rank up your gear as well as SOME BS FAKE PERCENTAGE CHANCE to rank up, it might say you have 90% chance to rank up, but guess what, YOU FAIL THAT ♥♥♥♥ TWICE IN A ROW, 90% MY ASS NEXON, SHOW THE REAL STATS.

Well, I may be under the influence at the time of this writing, but I think my point has been made. FIX YOUR GODAM GACHA GATED PROGRESSION NEXON.

As someone who has played MS since the open beta ended way back when up til a few months ago, and even played the Korean, Japanese and SEA servers at different points in time, I think I can give a prety good overview.

A lot of people are blinded by nostalgia when it comes to this game. You may even see people saying that the game was better back when it took 12 hours to lvl up at lvl 73, which is absolutely absurd. The grind to even play your character back then was absolutely ridiculous. The only thing that pre-Big Bang Maplestory had that this version now doesn't is the sense of community and life that was everywhere. People will say that there isn't a sense of community now and that people don't help each other which is untrue. The community just isn't at the low levels, low levels meaning anything below 200. The players are still very friendly and helpful, and will go out of their way to party you if you have quests on the same map, and the Chu~Chu Island PQ at lvl 210 is a bunch of fun. Except for birdsharks. ♥♥♥♥ birdsharks.
You've seen me say lvl 200 and 210 previously, so how many levels are there? 250. There are 250 lvls in this game and at no time does the progression ever not give you rewards. 1-140 give you skill points, 141-200 give you hyper skills, 141-250 give you hyper ability points, and every 6 levels after 200 gives you an extra node slot. The first 200 lvls fly by, there are people that can do them in 8 hours and for some it'll take a few weeks. Most notably though is the insane Exp curve. At lvl 200 the Exp required to level goes from about an hour or two to 4 hours or more, especially if you play on Reboot and train in the Arcane maps before getting the 1,5x Arcane force multiplier from the daily quests. And the grind only gets more and more difficult. Previously I mentioned that at lvl 73 pre-Big Bang you could take 10+ hours to level up. Post Big Bang getting from 203-204 takes about as long without the Arcane force multiplier affecting your damage and letting you grind at better mobs. Because as an unfunded character you're going to be grinding at either Scrapyard or the first area of Vanishing Journey for a good 2 or so weeks if you don't miss any Vanishing Journey daily quests. Later on you can expect 2% exp per hour, which, considering the lvl requirements of later areas like Arcana, is going to take you months.
As for the social aspect of the game now, joining a good, active guild is necessary. If you don't join a good, active guild, on Reboot especially, your progression past 200 will be absolutely glacial. You need a good guild to do end game bosses with and to get decent equipment, which is doubly true for Commerci PQ because most people aren't going to risk having a random in their party looting a class specific weapon or mega rare item that's untradeable on Reboot and worth a bunch on regular servers. So basically, you have to do your social networking and join a community of good players.
Maplestory is very much a long term MMO. You have to get to a threshold level to get into the community, which is really only a matter of time, your progression is measured more in a few months at time than in days or weeks and there is something to do every single day you log in. Most people who say that Pre-Big Bang was better doesn't remember how it used to be and they would quit it if they played it after they played the version that exists now. In summation, ♥♥♥♥ Pre-Big Bang.

Onto the actual game.
The differences between the Korean version and the North American version are staggering, less so with the Japanese and even less with the SEA version. So I'll start off with the easiest.
SEA:
SEA, compared to NA, or Global, used to be different in that they would receive patches ahead of time of NA. To my knowledge this is not true anymore. The only real advantage SEA has is that it has a map called Parkin Lot which makes lvling to 200 even easier. Beyond that, the SEA economy is in absolute shambles and the Cash Shop aspect there is even worse.
JP:
It's been years and years since I've played the JP version or even heard talk of it but from what I recall JP players got 10% more base experience and they have a toad boss that NA doesn't.
KR:
This is the best version of the game. KR Maple does not have Gollux, it does not have Commerci, it does not have ghost exorcist badge, and most importantly it does not have Kannas. So why is this version the best? Because it is the least P2W. The mileage system of KR Maple allows you to buy anything from the Cash Shop, the fact that you can get mileage from bosses, from epic boss spawns, and from frequent events means that you can get pretty much anything you want. You can also buy permanent Cash items either from the Cash Shop or from the fantastic economy. The economy there is wonderful and not crazily inflated. If I remember correctly 1bil mesos there is about $60 USD, which is much much better than any other economy on any other version. The events on this version are frequent and this version gets content the fastest and most frequently as well. The last big difference is that this version has flames on equipment, which is another sort of equipment modifier. I would still not recommend playing this version though unless you can understand Korean and are willing to practice how to type Korean characters. There are a few reasons for this, mainly the English community there is dying and there are only a handful of English speaking players left, you need to know how to type Korean characters to even log into the game and you need them later on to answer anti-botting captchas that randomly pop up. It's fairly simple though to learn, you can learn with a few hours of practice and be fine. The biggest reason I wouldn't recommend this version though is that you have to buy a premade account off of a shady Chinese website for $10.

Maplestory is a pretty fun, mindless game. If you can immerse yourself in the game, you'll have a great time. As is, before you even start the game you have to choose what you'll invest. Do you want to invest time or money into the game? If time, go to Reboot, if not go to any regular server. If you play Korean MS, don't play Reboot.
Now that you've gotten through that, if you're playing on not-KMS (Korean Maplestory) make a Kanna, especially if you're on Reboot, if you're on Reboot playing a Kanna and getting it to at least lvl 150 is mandatory so you can farm gold at a decent rate.
Now that you've gotten your Kanna up to a decent lvl to farm Mesos you can choose what your main class will be. There are a bunch of cool classes like Cadenas and Crossbowmen and what not. Literally any class is viable for end game bosses like Lucid, Damien, Lotus, etc. except for Bishops and Kannas because they DPS way too slowly and bring nothing to boss fights. Ironically Bishops and Kannas are most valuable for grinding lvls and mesos.
Great, so you've brought your main to lvl 200, gotten your Kanna up to acceptable farming rates, and now you're looking for stuff to do inbetween Arcane River dailies, farming for %meso gear and bosses. This is where you go make link and union mules, which gives you a chance to play other classes without feeling like you're wasting time not playing on your main. If you do get to the point where you're making mules for Union get your mules to 141 first for the most convenient Tier of Union and once you have all of them done go back around and get them to 200 for Grand Master Union.

Basically everything you do in this game will eventually get you stronger. Sure you could get even stronger if you spent more money or time, but you'll get there eventually any way. Play it until you get bored, quit for a while then come back and do it again for a bit. You get to scratch your itch of playing a decent, mindless MMO with others and your progression isn't invalidated by new stuff that comes out unless there's a complete overhaul again like Big Bang."

I adored this game as a kid and nostalgia keeps me coming back but there's some glaring problems with it.

First, the good:

-The game mechanics feel fun. Hitting mobs, using skills and running around the mob is exciting and satisfying. The characters are super cute, the NPCs are designed well and every character has their own sort of story (except the original explorers). I actually really enjoyed going through every characters individual starting quests. For a few brief moments, it did feel like a fun little RPG. I also really enjoy the optional aesthetics they created in the cash shop. I think the skins are really charming, the pets are cute and the hair styles are fun.

Now the bad, which is pretty much everything else.

-Old quests are obsolete now. There used to be quests that gave you a cape or unique shoes and everyone wanted to do them. It felt like a little adventure, like an actual RPG. Jane Doe needed help getting medicine and she gives you a cape as gratitude. But now, there are only about 3-5 quests until level 80 that you can do that are worth it. Low level equipment is garbage because you get to level 100 so fast. Everyone just does the theme dungeon because its the best way to get experience, so why do any other quests? I consider bad game design when developers just write code over their old code, and don't maintain that old code. If other quests aren't worth it, no one will do them and it's just a waste of space.

-They come out with a new hero every now and then, and it makes other classes so unrewarding to play, because if one class does so much better, why even play the old ones? In other RPGs, other status such as defense is worth looking into. But due to the fact that you basically have to grind to lvl 100 to do anything fun, the thing that matters is damage output. Don't get me wrong, other classes are viable (not awful, just not good) it's just that when a new class comes out, it does so much more with such little resources, it doesn't feel like you should ever revisit old characters.

-Mesos have been inflated and pets feel mandatory. Old maple used to have a bustling economy . It forced you to purchase a shop if you ever wanted to make real mesos. Then you had to re-invest that money into scrolls for a chance to make your items better. I felt like that was truly pay to win. But now, you can simply increase your equipment's stat through star enhancement, so I can feel powerful without spending nx cash. I appreciate this change but it made way for new problems. I need A LOT of mesos to deck out everything and you can do that by doing certain boss fights but until level 120 you get the money by picking up mesos. That's so annoying to do without a pet, which requires money.

-Another scummy tactic that nexon has used to get money is the idea of MVP. There used to be 2x EXP coupons, which imo was fair. You pay a little extra and you level up faster. You can still level just fine on your own, the 2x felt optional to me. But they took that out now and you get the 2x coupons to give away if you spend enough NX. Because of server abandonment issues, character world transfers are only available through a loot box mechanic system, which is a super scummy way of getting your players to spend more money. To get the items you want, you have to keep wasting more money.

-They re-worked how hair coupons work to make more money. Old maple had all hair types at your disposal. You had to check what city the hair was available in and then go to the city, purchase it, and you're good to go. Now, there are only two hair coupons. One is random royal hair coupon and the other one is a choice coupon. Theres so many hair styles but they all go on rotation, so the one you want might not be available until next month. This means if you create a character, and want to change the hair style you HAVE TO choose and buy whatever is in stock at the moment. This means if you dont like the hair your character has, you have to change it to whats available then spend money to buy hair again when the one style you like comes out.

-There are bugs everywhere. I don't know if it's bad coding but they seem to only rewrite code on top of existing code. For example, their text UI stays open when another text UI opens. The search bar for their map stops working every once in a while. If I can't find anything, the world map crashes. Upon even opening maplestory, it fails about 30% of the time and I have to re-launch it. When I try to click on a spot in a map, a pop up says 'you dont have a teleport rock' then navigation opens. It feels like the developers were lazy and just didnt code that out. Just write 'if (rock not in inventory) then (dont show pop up)'. But perhaps theres too much spaghetti code and they can't write over it. It happens with projects that have too many developers or projects that are too old.

-The UI is TERRIBLE. My god. It's 2020 as I write this review and the UI is so ♥♥♥♥♥♥ awful. As soon as you finish your base quest and you're free to do what you want, there's so much garbage stuffed in your face. But this is a common flaw I see in a lot of MMOs. The developers think players want every button for guild, quests, mining, etc available to them, without considering how much it clutters a screen. How are new players supposed to come to this game without being overwhelmed? To get into it, you pretty much have to have a friend to guide you through it.

-The worst thing they did, imo, was completely nerf low level party quests. They replaced everything with theme dungeons, which give good exp but the reason why maple was so popular before was because of the social aspect. I had to do ludi PQ, or kerning PQ and it was super fun. I met people and made friends, which made me want to continue to play. PQs gave players reason to interact. The social aspect of MMOs are what make MMOs enjoyable and nexon kind of just ruined that.

Overall: greedy company ruined this game. Don't play unless for the nostalgia.

Updated Edit: Worth playing casually, but that's it. Don't spend money on this game. Log in and have some fun, but this game isn't worth giving to the company. Some of the most disgusting tactics I've seen with horrible customer service. Events are buggy, new players have a hard time progressing, everything is RNG. Use it as an afk machine for when youre watching something or doing something on the side.

Still buggy with little QOL improvements. Why does my item menu go transparent when im being hit by a mob? Take that garbage out."

This game has gambling mechanics, and these gambling mechanics are necessary for progress. If you play on a ""regular server"", you can pay real money to gamble for progress. If you play the ""Reboot server"", you earn in-game currency through gameplay, and you gamble with that instead.
If you're like me, if you understand statistics, if you're not vulnerable to gambling addiction, if you play Reboot, you can play this game with no problems.
If you are vulnerable to gambling addiction, if you don't rigorously keep track of your spending, this game can hurt you for real, and hard. There is some seriously negativity in this game's player base, because some people have been seriously hurt financially by this game. Some people continue to be hurt by this game.

That's why I'll never recommend this game to anyone. If you're not vulnerable to gambling addiction, this game has a lot of content and is a lot of fun, and it's even fun free2play.

It's a good game overall, but before you Invest your Time and Money to this Maple Journey, I would warn you First.

This game is all about RNG, enhancement of your Gear requires that, drop of equip requires that, and upgrading Gear potential requires that. Worst of all, you can get banned in a Totally Random time at totally random moment. PURE RNG.

and once you get banned even if you didn't hack or anything, you lost all your rights.

Investigation team doesn't care if you hacked or not, they only care if anything triggered their ♥♥♥♥♥♥ anti-hack system.
while real hackers hacking all they want.

And the moment you get falsely banned. You WON""T be able to recover anything, not even the NX you charged an hour ago before you get banned.

NO REFUND TO HACKERS, they said. even if you didn't hack.

It's a great game, great art and music, but it's been ran by notorious Nexon .

Don't invest your time and money on this , Read their ToS. They can literally Suspend,Delete,Ban your account with no reason, it's written there !"

So yeah, I genuinely cannot recommend this game as of right now. Maybe in the future I will change my review on Maplestory again. I have many more hours on the Nexon client.

Nexon KR has decided that the global release should be more in line with the Korean client (nothing wrong necessarily). But Nexon NA (works as publisher for the global version) have been straight up lying to the players about why choices have been made. Just look up ""2x drop coupons GMS"" on YouTube and listen to explanations by CopperSan or Scardor. In short, every kind of strategy or item that could be beneficial for player progression is either being removed or nerfed into oblivion. Everything that made the global release its own game, is being removed slowly for the past ~2 years. Which really does suck. Korean, NA and EU are very different clients that need to be catered differently. It's too bad because there is no other game like MapleStory. I really like the chibi characters and cutesie look of the game. Yeah, the game is grindy, always has been. But big numbers make my lizard brain tingle in a good way.

Although these last points really suck, I would still play the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game if it weren't for Nexon NA incompetent communication. Every single point of interest that needs addressing, either happens too late or doesn't happen at all. But, let's say communication about a certain delicate topic happens, Nexon NA gets caught lying about reasoning or ""data"". This has happened a lot of times in the last ~4 years. If you don't believe me, go to r/MapleStory and sort by ""All Time Top"". You will find threads stacked on top of each other about boycotts and their reasoning. Literally everytime the number 1 argument is the barren communication between Nexon NA and the community. This year, for the first time, Maplestory Global had a roadmap released. The roadmap was a joke and Nexon didn't comply with their own planning, again no communication about it.

I really hope Nexon & Nexon NA get their ♥♥♥♥ together and start looking at ways to engage more with the community behind the global release. These people are literally the most engaged group of people I have seen in a long time. So, after this long rant, just don't play it. It's not worth it, because you literally never know what might happen next. It could be you just loose 6 months of progression because the stupid starforce system or because Nexon decided to nerf your class to the ground without warning. I didn't talk about the enhancing system at all in this review, but if you think BDO or POE is awful, just wait until you learn you could loose 2~3 months of progression by booming an item. So, no stale progression, like LA, actually loosing progression.

I have no idea if Steam will say at all if I've played Maplestory but I promise you all I have put a lot of time into this game and absolutely loved every minute. Unfortunately Maplestory just became completely uninteresting since I've tried to relive it. And it makes me really sad. Maplestory originally had the classes we all see in every MMO (no matter how hard other MMO's try to make it different) and of course also like every MMO it started off simple. One big difference of course was the fact that it was a 2D sidescrolling MMOPRG and it's done so beautifully. You can make different faces at people depending on how you feel which was really fun before the cliche ""lol"" and ""lmao"" texts we all now universally know. Getting weapons was also a little more unique since most MMO's just milk weapons. Now a lot of MMORPG's have bows with unlimited arrows and guns with unlimited bullets. Maplestory made you buy arrows and throwing stars/shuriken if you wanted to be a ranged class. And Mesos (Maplestory currency) was hard to come by at low levels making it even more challenging since you had to actually ask for money from time to time.

When I originally loved this amazing piece of gaming art you had to use a taxi to get to different cities (which you still do at least) and use flying boats to get to different continents. This was a huge deal because it allowed you to just settle down for a short time and actually talk to people; and listen to music along the way. Now this is not the case. There were no overpowered and annoyingly voice acted 'Hero' classes that literally kill everything in their paths with ease. You really had to work to get more powerful back then and you also needed to manually know what your stats needed to be for your class. Maplestory added more powerful classes over time but they were never 'Hero' status. Yes they got more powerful due to their unique skills compared to the default classes; however you still needed to start off as a default class and work your way into the more unique class you selected and leveling was still just as hard for you as the rest.

The music is still the same Maplestory anime music I know and love. I just wish it could be heard with the game I knew and loved. For all you new players out there reading this review it'll mean close to nothing probably. To shorten what I just said: Maplestory used to be a surprisingly vast game filled with lots of social opportunity and hours upon hours of questing and leveling. It's a shell of its former self now. This does not mean I say it's a bad game. It's still good and worth the try. But unfortunately you have missed the golden age that was Maplestory. It's all milked down and I can't recommend it in its state now. What used to take a couple weeks to a month takes less than a day now. Bosses that originally required a full team can easily be defeated solo and the monsters that were originally intimidating and powerful are powerless. The challenge is gone. I will miss you Maplestory."

Here is an honest review of this game

Pros:
-Very well-made and rare 2D style, very refreshing
-Beautiful Art in weapons, monsters, maps and landscapes
-Amazing original sound tracks that masterfully complements the Art
-Interesting story and worldbuilding
-Multiple options to spend your time in game, that although grindy can be a lot of fun
-Distinct and balanced classes for the player to choose
-Active developers and moderators with great anniversary and seasonal events
-Fair and mostly cosmetic real money transactions that you don’t need to advance to a decent level

Cons:
All of the Pros points are no longer true in recent times, and are only alive in the memory of the og players that you can hear whisper “Look How They Massacred My Boy…”

This Game WAS a MSTERPICE in all its extent but Nexon has found a way to corrupt and butcher one of the best mmorpg games ever made and completely alienate and divide their player base

Let me state the current state of the Pros points
-Very well-made and rare 2D style – Only still true because they can’t mess this one up, but is becoming irrelevant as time passes
-Beautiful Art in weapons, monsters, maps and landscapes – becoming more and more pixel noise on the screen with no much thought put into it, the difference with the old and original content is very palpable, and the similarities makes it look as if the original developers/artists could sue the new ones for copyright
-Amazing original sound tracks that masterfully complement the Art – The new music is not bad but nowhere near the level of the iconic masterpieces that the original songs on the old maps represent and felt when played, the sheer amount of personality added via music was amazing
-Interesting story and worldbuilding – long gone, the story has been changed, made irrelevant and poorly expanded to the point where you cant make sense of all the mess, far from the simple yet interesting story that would make you want to complete the main quest line, reduced to a nuisance you have to complete to advance your class
-Multiple options to spend your time in game – The game is now complete grind, this was also somewhat true before, but now it has been reduced to very few maps where you sit and spam a single wide area attack for hours in the same spot with the few classes that allow you to, other classes that cannot do this are simply unviable.
There are no options, no variation, no nothing, but the same map with the same monster and same attack, every 10 levels until you move to the next.
-Distinct and balanced classes for the player to choose - new classes completely overpowered the original ones, instead of creating new concepts, mechanics, weapons and story they simply took the style and roles the og classes fulfilled and raised the power level in every aspect, while thinking the player wouldn’t notice the lazy copy paste under a different label, they did noticied.
Again, there are no options, no variation, no nothing, all the different ways to build you character and play have been removed from the game, even though we have many times the number of classes the game had years ago it feels like you have less options because only a few classes are viable now, with the building path being set in stone, there is only optimal build and complete trash, there is no in between.
-Active developers and moderators with great anniversary and seasonal events – gone, events are mostly repetition of what has been done before and the lack of community is determining to the success of the event, reduced to more solo grind
-Fair and mostly cosmetic real money transactions that you don’t need to advance to a decent level.
Finally, the worst part of all, pay-to-win is the law that governs this game now, like so many other famous games pay-to-win butchered the original cash system and made it impossible to play end game content without milking the player in some way, constantly forcing players to expend a large amount of money or lag behind the rest

The worst part is that every negative aspect of pay to win, has been multiplied by the HUGHE amount of RNG that is involved in the process, every item you’re forced to buy is linked to an awful RNG mechanic know as ‘success rate’ everything that enhances your gear has a success rate awfully low or is plane lottery with the thing you want having less than 1% chance to happen, causing players to buy hundreds of items just to get the one thing they wanted in the first place

In Resume this game was a masterpiece a decade ago, today the only people playing do it just for nostalgia, they go the old areas and listen to the good old music and once-great places now wastelands, or have spent so much they feel like they can’t quit now, or are completley new and play for a while until they realise what is underneed this beautiful shell of a game that now is best used as an example to new games and companies on how not to run and maintain a game/brand."

Ok, so I have played a decently amount of time for this game... i mean, 4000 hours...

Pros:
-Waifu bosses
-(reboot server is the only aspect that isnt p2w)

Cons:
-need pay-to-win gears to get to and beat waifu bosses

-boring events and / or recycled events

-dev doesnt listen to the community (they recently did a survey on r/maplestory, however, every person's concern were either skimmed over or just blatantly ignored, instead the devs addressed the issue by making up their own opinions. Basically a survey of wasting players 5mins)

-community manager sucks at communicating (r/maplestory hates the community manager because he has blatantly banned a player on the official forums reason being the player criticized the CM on reddit...like really dude?)

-no transparency between devs and the community (theres no communication channel between the CM and the community unlike every other game this age, theres no weekly stream, theres no dev logs, theres no updates on if any of the glitches/issues are being worked on, NOTHING)

-toxic community

-censor words in the game are just ridiculous, ""my first time"" is censored...

-grind fest (surely it's been made easier to level from 1-200, however, most end game content is located at lv 220, to put in perspective, lv 219-220 is leveling 1-200 4 times)

-useless quests, an insane amount of useless quests (what's even worse is the rewards doesn't even scale to level, and the rewards are straight up fodder made for NPC or tossing it away, consequently you can progress in the game without doing a single quest, whats even better i you'll lag LESS if you dont do them)

-game is filled with hackers, botters, and cash farmers (aka the economy in the game is absolutely horrible, and it isnt that easy to get money either)

-game masters doesnt do jack with hackers (to top it off, game masters themselves dont know how to play the game, i.e. during GM events, they dont even know the censorship is outta whack in the game (you can see the words not censored on your side, but on other people's screen it's censored), doesnt know how to cancel buffs via right click)

-very easy to hack in and will result with no consequences whatsoever

overall, a mediocre, less-than-average game to waste time in but not good enough to stick around if youre coming back or wanting to try this game out

edit: for a game that's been out for more than 10 years, it's very glitchy, it's very unstable, it crashes way too much, and the devs have said they are ""looking into it"" for the past 5 years and nothings changed"

I used to play this game in early high school, damn near almost 20 years ago. I wanted to come back and relive some memories. I expected a lot to have changed throughout the game, but I didn't expect the first 2 hours of the ""explorer"" story, the one you want to play for the most classic experience, to be an endless barrage of talking, poor voice acting, a generic ""evil mage"" story and being teleported to random places by questgivers. I'm supposed to be an ""explorer"". Why are questgivers teleporting me to precisely where I need to be for a quest? What's the point of exploring? And then when I get there, it's just more unskippable scenes and more talking.

I just want to play the game, bro. Not listen to some grown adult get a job at Nexon play out their 20 year old Maple Story self-insert fan fiction. I have never been so bored in my life. I thought that whole section was a tutorial, then I reached my SECOND (??????) Job Advancement? I don't even remember leveling up. I would sit there, talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and, and then suddenly, with no real notification, I'm level 30 and have like 120 unspent skill points?

I thought skill advancement was supposed to be reward for playing the game, not just something that you passively accumulate in between conversations with cringy chibi anime characters.

If you played this game a very long time ago, and looking for that nostalgia kick, don't even bother. Go on Youtube and watch old videos of what Maple Story used to be."

I really can't recommend it right now, but its the best game in the world.
I talk about 2004-2006 MapleStory, the game that was an adventure to go and meet new people
People were nice and funny, At certain points, it was a must to play with people to advance.
It's really the summary of summaries about maple, but I think you got me.

Nowadays maple is bitter, cold ,
you basically play a singleplayer game that sits on an online service.
Rarely you'll find someone that will be interested in communication.

World of warcraft classic server was announced a month ago.
The community knew the old wow was what they wanted to play and they fought for it.
I think it's our time to fight for our lovely game too.

Go play old server instead, you'll get the feeling I got in about 10 minutes into the game."

While fun overall leveling and unique for it's 2D style, the game as a lot of issues, and it's why I would not recommend it. You're free (well kind of) to try it and form your own opinion but this is just me.


Biggest cons in my opinion:

You are forced to get carried for the good loot that you would need to do the bosses with, which is silly. The alternative is to play the OP classes that doesn't require much insane gearing.

Potential on items is so rare it's stupid, and since you need to potential all your gear but only have a small chance to actually succeed the scrolls.

You need to buy pets with real money to loot items for you, otherwise it's just tedious to get the item drops, and they are not permanent duration.

A lot of quests don't have any good guidance as to what to do next or where to go, end up alt tabbing to see what needs to be done, and a lot of times guides aren't up to date so it's extra difficult.

Prequests are sometimes long, annoying and or not rewarding to unlock bosses. And guess what, you need to redo all of them if you want to play those on another character.

Server issues and maintenance downtime are often ludicrous, For example today is a big event arrival and only 1-3 very unstable servers are usable and sometimes the game won't even launch.

The resolution is quite low, so when you're on a higher native resolution and tabbing out it's really annoying.

Most of the clicking with the mouse is then cluncky and if you're slightly inaccurate the action won't perform. Such as dialogue boxes and menus and so on.

You need to play many characters at high levels before getting more damage for endgame that is somewhat required for certain classes.

I have probably 2000+ hours before this game even hit Steam. Everyone is absolutely correct in saying this game is a husk of its former self. Big Bang changed it forever, however... I just can't stop coming back. On and off occassionally over the years. Maybe it's nostalgia, maybe it's like a bad relationship where you tend to block out the bad and only see the good. The company isn't much better either. I started playing in 2006, and still to this day can't stop finding my mind wavering back to it every so often. Its like that ex you just can't stop texting, but she herself isn't really wanting to let you leave either.

MapleStory,Not Recommended,280.4,"Posted: December 12, 2014
Review as follows: Simple version up top, detailed on ""read more"". Note: I have played this game for well over 2,000+ hours over the years, and long before it was released on steam; how I ever racked up that many hours I will never know, but the game is not worth even 1 hour of your playtime.

The good:
A classic 2D action platformer
Many character classes
Many areas to explore
The Bad
Character classes are horribly balanced
Classes do not particularly stand out from each other (their niche's all blur together now)
There is a huge problem with botters and hackers (people using cheats)

On to the detailed and truely abominable things that make this game horrendous, almost beyond words.


The simple act of looting is to push the ""loot"" button which is both ""Z"" and the numpad 0. As you progress through the game the method for fighting ""mobs"" is at the bucket loads, you will be killing 4~12 monsters within every 5 seconds. Each monster drops 2~4 items which are money, a misc monster drop, a potion, and a ""ticket fragment"" of sorts to do a special instance run that is always dead (no one does them.). So for every item you want to pickup, you must push ""Z"" and you will find that you will quickly be pushing that key hundreds if not THOUSANDS of times every few minutes. And if you dont loot those items you make essentially no money. The entire economy is seriously inflated to begin with too. If you want looting to be convenient be prepared to shell out about $30~$40 every 90 days for a pet and its ""gear"" to make it run around to loot things for you.

You are forced to struggle with inventory space. At first you may think that you have plenty of space, but you quickly find out that the ""Use"" items and ""misc"" tabs will quickly be overlowing from NECESSARY items (the several hundred or THOUSAND potions you will be carrying, and have to replace every few hours or so). while the ETC slot will be filled with quest items, materials for crafting, and of course the hoards of monster drops you will be picking up (which usually only stack up to 200).

Items you buy with $$ are NOT account-wide. They use a nonsense ""cash inventory"" system which is only shared with other characters of the same class (except in some rare caes like the ""adventurer"" series of classes or the ""cygnus knights."" However after the addition of the resistance they have their own shared cash inventory as well. You may think that is good enough but it IS NOT! because there are 2x of all that combined in classes that have a cash inventory shared only with other characters of the same class (which is POINTLESS because then you would be leveling up the exact same thing all over again; as each class only has 1 build, a special exception is made few 2 or 3 classes which can be either 1 element or another). Please note I am not talking about how a magician splits off into ice/lightning or fire/poison, I am referring to how a single class with a single skillset can have skills you wont want to invest in because they have no real part in the only effective way to create your character; which can be ever so important as there are skills in future advancements that require some certain skills to be Maxed.).

They purposefully make things that should be everyday and easy access functions, exceedingly hard. For example, if you want to sell ANYTHING to ANY players, you want to go to the ""free market"" with about 50 other people, all spamming trying to sell things. If you want to sell ANYTHING as easily as it should be, you have to spend about ~$5 to buy a shop that your character has to man (lasts 90 days) just to sell things, which is horrendous in itself because you cant play the game, and it has a tendency to , and so hard you will have to . So if you want to sell things as effectively as it should be, you have to spend $10 USD+ just to setup a store that will sell things for you (you set prices), and those can last 1 day to 7 days (getting more expensive for longer, up to $30 USD.)


They come out with new character classes OFTEN! I swear, whenever you start getting your character to a high enough level to be happy with it, they release something that will outclass you in EVERY WAY! and you will essentially be forced to play that newest class since the monsters only get stronger to keep competing with the newest classes. And dont expect your old class to get revamped any time soon! it took them well over 3 years just to update the adventurers ONCE. and over a year for most anything else. In some cases the skillsets even change so completely you wont even recognize what to put your skill points into! but it gets because if you make a mistake you will have to spend the $5+ USD to reset your points and hope you get it right the next time. It used to be that you had to spend about that much to reset a SINGLE POINT! and most skills require 20 or 30, im sure you can see how atrocious that is (the complete reset is only a new addition too, if you wanted reset you had to wait until they revamp your class again, because customer service WILL NOT HELP YOU!

Customer service from Nexon is essentially non-existant, in fact, 99% of any and all messages you will get from them are automated. And no matter how large or small your problem is, nothing will be done. Your account getting hacked, or a broken quest (some havent been fixed for 2+ years), maybe even missing items/progress from a rollback, you will not get any help.

There is no acceptable passive regen's (% or fixed numbers) for being in or out of combat, the only class that had one (the Jett) was removed with their revamp. So of course you must rely on potions ENTIRELY for you healing (unless you are a healer of sorts). The only passive regen you do have is 10hp for standing still for 10 seconds, and at higher levels (something you quickly reach) you have 7,000+ HP easy. while mana regen's at 3, which your mana is easily over 2,000 regardless of class (mages can go up to 30,000).

There are countless more horrible things I can tell you about, but i feel I have made my point, and I beleive this is enough reasons why this game is among the things you should never play. Comments and likes are greatly appreciated! lets get the word out on why this is an awful game!"
MapleStory,Not Recommended,"2,454.2","Posted: July 4, 2022
UPDATING THIS REVIEW ONE MORE TIME: Nexon has officially removed the Jett class from the game because it introduces bugs they don't want to dedicate time towards fixing. Jett is a Global Maplestory exclusive class. There are a few other non-Korean Maplestory classes like Beast Tamer, Hayato, and Kanna which could be removed on a whim at this point. They allowed anyone with a Jett to transfer to a different job in the Explorer branch, but the way the transfer was done was poor and not well thought out. I was personally affected as I had a level 250 Jett I had sunk around 1000 hours into (kind of low for some of the more hardcore players). Honestly after this removal my desire to play the game is basically zero, there's no reason to put time into these unique classes when they could be removed at any time for any reason. The hyper burning and tera burning events aren't enough for me to come back. I'd still recommend playing literally any other game, even Lost Ark.

The ignition update has now launched (11/16/22) and I wanted to add a small tidbit to this review. Nexon has officially removed an item from the game that boosts spawn rates for two hours. You used to be able to buy 15 of these per month by using currency from killing bosses. Without these the game is still perfectly playable but progression will be much slower in comparison. Still cannot recommend this game, and certainly not in light of spawn booster removal.

To be frank, I love this game but can't recommend it to anyone.
It's not even that the game has many problems, to Nexon's credit many client bugs and server issues that used to plague this game are generally fixed and I might crash once a month now. Whereas in the past I would crash once or twice a day while doing dailies.

It's not even that progression is heavily time gated through dailies, or that the game requires an absurd amount of hours and has a near necessity to create dozens of alts to make any real progress on your main.

It's not even that I think the EXP curve is bad post 250, or that the balancing is bad, or that the jump between killing higher level bosses is bad.

It's not even that for the mind numbing weeks of grinding that turn in to months, and then to years you're not even guaranteed to make progress. Blowing up your equipment is the norm here. RNG will be both cruel and benevolent.

I think the main reason I can't recommend this game to anyone is that there are so many better things to do with your time. I'm invested in the game, I'll be playing it until it shuts down. I don't mind that it's going to suck thousands of hours more of my life away before I stop playing.

But if you're dead set on playing this game and you want something mindless with a steady sense of getting something done, this is a good fit. There are so many unique classes in this game it's hard to imagine someone not finding something they'll fall in love with. You've heard it again and again from reviewers but the graphics in this game feel timeless. The music is beautiful, and if you've played in the past the nostalgia is going to hit hard. It's endearing. As of writing this review (7/4/22) the Destiny update has launched and right now might be the best time ever to play this game.

Assuming you're going to play the game in the ""traditional sense"", the gameplay loop will be grinding for an obscene amount of hours to get strong enough to take down a new boss. You'll kill the boss, get the loot if it has any, and start gearing up to kill the next boss. Sounds fast right? Not really. Bosses are weekly and their drops are either RNG or time gated. With some bosses you could go dry for over a year on a drop you might want.

Know what you're signing up for here. At the bare minimum you'll need to train 12 other characters that you may not enjoy playing to gain skills to ""transfer"" to your main. These are fairly significant and you'll need them if you're going to be serious about playing. If you really want to min/max you'll need to play a total of 40 characters, not consistently, but at least each one to a specific level. I enjoyed it, many don't.

Assuming you don't want to spend money, the Reboot server is generally the way to go. This server disables trade between players and has been revamped to allow players to play the entire game without spending money if they really want. Otherwise, playing on any other server be prepared for a long F2P road or to fork over money in the magnitudes of thousands to reach the endgame. Reboot is a time investment. Regular servers are generally a money investment. Both are possible F2P.

If you're on the fence and like what you see in videos and pictures, give it a shot. The real gameplay loop starts at level 200. Look up guides for things you're confused on, the game has a lot of different systems and menus you need to navigate to enjoy it.

Otherwise, don't bother. Find another game."

Maplestory was a great game until the big bang, the massive update which changed allot about the game. It use to take a long time to level, and maps were filled with players. Exploring was fun, diverse and dangerous. Cash shop didn't even exist, okay it did but it was not selling crazy buffs, items or even pets. Back then it was completely optional. This created a fair and fun game. Party quests were awesome and made you play and work together with other players. Each class had a specific task to fufill. I remember how the thief used the dark sight skill to accomplish a goal which only he could do because of the mobs doing crazy damage. This was rad!

Today it's all about spending money. You level 10 times faster and there's no need for exploring. There is seriously a way to fast travel without even having to been there first. Quests are accepted and completed remotely. You rarely meet other players. The party quests still exist (all in one place now, no need to actually go to that specific town or place) but good luck finding a team. It's all empty. You level alone, you play alone, you do your theme dungeons, get to 4th (or 5th? idek) job and just start grinding bosses until you hit level cap and spend money in cash shop so you get the best items with the best stats..

TL;DR: This game is as good as dead, and is mostly p2w. Not recommended. RIP."

Maplestory is a game I have played for 15+ years. The game is much different now than it was on release, as is normal for any game that has been going on as long as Maplestory has. My main issue with Maplestory is the predatory nature of the microtransactions.

Recently Nexon, the publishers of Maplestory, released their rates for their cubes. For those who are unaware, cubes are the way you power up items. They are expensive and difficult to obtain without spending lots of money. Cubes reset the potential stats on items. They have a chance to upgrade the stats to a higher tier, going from Rare - Epic - Unique - Legendary. These stats are where the bulk of your damage comes from.

The rates that were released showed that there was less than a 2% chance of getting an upgrade from Epic to Unique and the rates for Unique to Legendary was less than 0.5%. You can understand how frustrating this can be for someone who has sent thousands of hours in the game (I played years before the steam release). Nexon has a history of providing terrible transparency and customer support to their players.

As fun as this game can be, I do not recommend it. If you are looking for something to kill some time, you will be better off playing almost any other game. Don't let the cute pixel art draw you in."

I first played MapleStory in December 2004. Back in those days, each town was teeming with life! It didn't really matter what you were doing - if you were buying potions, grinding monsters, completing quests, traveling around, or even just sitting still, odds were that at least a few people would cross paths with you. MapleStory did an excellent job at encouraging players to work together with fun and rewarding party quests. My favorite party quests, the monster carnival, pitted two teams of players against each other in a pseudo-PvP mode where you raced against the other party to kill as many monsters as you could before time ran out, and there were plenty of buffs you could get for your own team and debuffs you could cast on your opponent. Some of the greatest memories I have come from those duels. Each class was quite distinct from each other and while there were a few that were less balanced than others in terms of damage output and maneuverability, all were fun to play in their own right. Each server had a vibrant economy, with literally hundreds of players in the ""free-market"" at all hours of the day trying to buy and sell. The cash shop offered stores that you could leave open to sell items for you while you were offline. New content updates added new regions, monsters, and party quests that were always a joy to explore. Unfortunately, around 2010 a controversial update known as ""Big Bang"" was released, which re-organized the world map cutting out a lot of fan-favorite areas (R.I.P. Henesys Hunting Ground) and introduced a new system called Miracle Cubes. Up until this point, the only way to upgrade your gear was by using scrolls, a rare item dropped extremely rarely that would give you the chance to upgrade your gear. A 10% chance scroll would offer a large boost, whereas a 100% scroll would offer a small boost of maybe only a single stat point or two. With miracle cubes, which you have to spend real money on, you are able to re-roll up to three additional slots on your weapons stats. There's not much inherently wrong with this system, but the bonuses offered by these cubes cannot compare to what you could achieve before. Each slot can potentially give a bonus of +12% in a stat. Players that spent money on cubes were in another league than everyone else. This pretty much ruined the balance of the game and split the community down the middle. Not only that, but Nexon continued to disincentivize players from partying up. They implemented an EXP decrease if you were in a party with someone else and reduced the experience gain from party quests. New updates brought free, instant teleportation between continents (more or less) which pretty much meant that you wouldn't meet as many people as you were traveling from town to town. Solo-grinding became the fastest most efficient way to level up, so areas of the game that used to be brimming with life are now literal ghost-towns. MapleStory was once an excellent MMORPG, but now it is just a husk of it's former self. If you're able to find friends to play this game with, it might still be worth playing, but ask anyone, the glory days of this game are far, far, behind us."

(This review is based on the timeframe I spend playing the game from 2006 to early last year)

Maplestory is one of those games that you remember fondly as you watch it burn to the ground. All the old players from the past no longer reflect on the game as being one of the greatest memories of the era, as so many changes happened to the game that caused it to be what it is now.

To start, back in 06, I had started the game based on a friend's recommendation and ended up hitting forth job in 09. Back then, the grinding through levels was real and it took a normal player a few years to reach 3rd-4th job, which felt meaningful and players had pride for the work that they had put so much effort into the game.

Fast forward, and Big Bang, the expansion that was supposed to upgrade the game ended up shifting up a lot of the areas that players had met ingame. What was thought to be an expansion of the main game ended up with a boatload of different jobs and skill changes that overwhelmed the base game, causing upgrades to damage that ended up weakening the bosses that would take hours to kill into very-short session and the game really started to go downhill from there.

What took years to achive forth job ended up changing to getting to third or forth job in the matter of weeks. Playing the game casually, I ended up making it past level 200 without putting any effort as I would have in the past. Most bosses I fight now, save for the super broken chaos bosses, takes under a few minutes to kills. The impact of having a 200+ character is merely meaningless as the game is designed to have you make as many characters as possible instead of putting effort into a solo character that would prove to be the most meaningful to the player.

It may be that simply times are different now, and the expectations for mmo games have changed. However, maplestory changed itself too much from its original state and I simply cannot recommend this game anymore."

Boycott Nexon until they fix the servers and so many underlying issues on GMS. It's a mess, and they don't care about the player base; only their underlying profits.

Nexon America has a habit of ""promising to communicate better"" and then band-aid fixing issues, completely ignoring the community on some issues, server stability being one of many. Usually it's a ""We'll promise to do better, using Pink Bean Bulletin"", when in reality never using it. Some classes have been known to have been bugged to the point you get an automatic 30 day ban (Beast Tamer comes to mind).

To me, one thing that has become more noticeable in recent times than ever, is blatant favoritism towards the Reboot server, a server that has no trading and enhancement items available for meso, as well as some other perks. It's more of a ""solo progression server"" per-se, but usually any compensation or acknowledgement of issues only goes there, when there even is an acknowledgement of issue.

I've been playing MapleStory on and off since 2010, and the amount of ""it'll get better"" I've seen is absolutely horrendous; the communication is so bad to the point that it feels like DICE with Battlefield 2042, a whole different mess. There's realistically no point to play this game in North America/Europe at this point (especially if you're Dutch, given normal servers are essentially Reboot without any perks now). If you seriously want to play this game, other regions manage better, even the considered ""bad"" regions (thinking potentially of Asiasoft and MapleSEA).

All in all, this game is a shell of its former self, caused by a company that's got its head so far up it's own rear that they can't even do proper communication, to the point the CMs are being attacked, meanwhile there isn't much they can do.

Boycott Nexon, boycott MapleStory, any NX sales, or anything. This game needs true time and effort to fix the underlying crashing and stability issues, as well as the absurd amount of bugs that have plagued the game for years now, to the point it's barely playable, and you have to weigh whether the game will crash or not with too much on screen.

x3TheAran59, better known as Steve, made a YouTube video covering some of the things, and there's even a boycott Discord server due to how bad the game has gotten (you can find that easily on Reddit).

To say I'm disappointed in this game is an understatement; I'm absolutely disgusted with how they treat their players as cash cows and not players, and instead can't even find the issues with their servers (to the point they claimed upgrading them made them worse), and so much more.

All in all, MapleStory is a shell of its former self; if you can somehow get past the huge, HUGE issues, it's grindy to the point it's not even enjoyable at late game. The game is in a category of its own, given it's one of the only 2D MMORPGs on the market, but the huge disconnect has caused a huge rift and glaring problem for players, potentially Nexon.

Don't play this game, for god's sake. Play a better game."

In my opinion, this game used to be really good. It's still good, but not as good as it was.

Maplestory has lost something that many older players found extremely valuable, community. While community still exists in the form of guilds, free market, and henehoes, the lack of rewarding party quests and party-training zones encourage most players to walk the path of a solo player; simply put, the game rewards you much more for playing by yourself.

The game is still enjoyable. It allows you to spend your time to work towards achieving a certain goal, whether it be a higher level or new items. If you love grinding, you'll really enjoy this game."

This game should be 18+. Aggressive loot box and monetization of game mechanics to trick people into wanting to spend money in a game with a kid friendly art style and child friendly censorship, do not at a glance, line up with the games target demographic.

Good core gameplay. If you know exactly what you are doing the monetization in the game is quite reasonable excluding loot box systems, you can earn currency to buy monetized things by spending time in game which is always a nice mechanic to see in MMO.

Dailies system has been pushed nearly as far as it can go. Daily mission used to bring people back everyday can take 1-3 hours depending on current events and how much you care about your progression.

Lots of replayability, in fact the game wants you to make 40 characters (a Legion) which will take you between 5-80 hours each depending on your experience and resources on hand. (There area few 2 hour runs but this will not be 99% of players)

Fair amount of diversity in playstyle in the characters so it helps not make it too monotonous and if you abandon a character because you don't like it don't worry you helped make all your other characters stronger in the future your work is not wasted you helped your Legion.

Every month I've been playing this game there has been some scandal with the devs mistreating the community. Looking at community pages this appears to be a trend and they show very little signs of trying to improve. People are often gaslighted for voicing their opinions which may explain the lack of positive response from the developer.

No other game like it in the market."

Oh man has this game died so much.

When I first began playing which was in 2009, the Maplestory community was the best gaming community I had EVER experienced. The social aspect of the game was absolutely amazing. Back then, Factions weren't dead and every day I would find interesting people to play with and party up with. Now, maps are relatively quiet and empty, and you never get the party invites and friendliness that there used to be. People just farm to themselves and the amount of people playing has dropped so much that I feel like I'm playing on empty servers all of the time. People don't even bother talk to you and in the major cities all you find is afk players just sitting there waiting for you to rank up their fame. Gameplay has also changed for the worse too. Back then there were relatively few and DISTINCTIVE classes that were unique and gave the game a balanced and helpful feel. Nowadays there is just a bunch of classes that are very similar and their niches are intertwined so much that you feel like class choice doesn't really give you a new and fun experience anymore. They've also emphasized microtransactions too much that it just takes away from the game. Overall, you feel like you're playing in a largely empty singleplayer game that's not even fun because the social aspect has completely rotted to nonexistence and the large amounts of ""events"" that fail at trying to make the game more interesting. The game has died and I must admit that even if you pay lots of money to level up and look cool, it doesn't matter a single ounce in the end because you've wasted your hard earned captical on a game with a meaningless and dead world and community."

So, if someone sees this review (probably not) this is what maplestory 1 is:
1: you grind the ♥♥♥♥ out by pressing the same buttons.
2: keep grinding by killing monsters with the same buttons but with different effects.
3: Even more grinding
4: not even close to the end babyyyy
5: wow u get 1% exp each hour now
Result: you got your character to max lvl? congrats! you wasted like 3 months of your life for no reason.
TBH
If your new to the game, i recommend just look up a guide to farming exp, quests are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ useless. (Most of them at least) and most of the times, you'll find yourself just killing the same monsters over and over again for the next like week.
Why did I give this game a recommended review? Idk, im a no-life scrub, what else can I do?
If your the type that likes to grind to the point your keyboard is broken. well this is the game for you.

To this day I hold onto the hope that one day we'll get a Maplestory Classic.

There was something incredible about the slow process of leveling up, getting money the old fashioned way through questing and the social aspects of doing Party Quests together... Hitting Henesys PQ and working your way up to Kerning and Ludibrium etc etc... It was an incredible journey that felt satisfying and memorable.

The game in it's current state today is... different... still fun! don't get me wrong, but it does feel a bit like a hollow shell of it's former self, I'd say from my experience the leveling up process heavily relies on soloing maps and sadly, the game went from ""let's work together"" to "" MOVE CHANNEL PLZ""

I still recommend playing it tho! The game is vibrant and colourful, the soundtrack is probably one of my all time favourites! (honestly, I still often listen to it even whilst playing other games or when doing other stuff! check it out!), and overall there's still LOTS of content to explore and play through!

I'll go back to my original point tho... The game could definitely use a WoW style reboot in the realms of a ""Classic"" style server, or an ""Oldschool Runescape"" type thing...

Whether if it does or doesn't happen one day, I'll never know... But I'll always cherish the good times and the many great memories I've had growing up with this game :)"

ATTENTION EUROPEAN PLAYERS: Avoid playing on European servers at all costs, it's trash. Just play on the NA one, the european server lags like crazy. Especially if you've got strong internet, in that case you won't feel any lag in NA, while there'll always be lag on the european server, as it's the server's problem.

I don't want to beg for ""likes"", but please upvote this review so people can be aware of this.

Thank you in advance :)

Edit: I recently came back to MapleStory and remembered this review, so I should update to let you know that the EU server no longer lags and it's absolutely fine to play in. HOWEVER, be aware that Maple Story has always been many times more popular in the USA than in Europe, so our server is nowhere near a populated as the american one"

Been playing casually for many years and I probably have 1000+ hours. So if you are starting this game in 2022, STAY AWAY!!! It is a fun game, however the time and dedication required to see progress is definitely not sustainable and there are better games/things you can do with your time. I honestly and wholeheartedly believe the developers and management team of Nexon is deliberately trying to destroy this game. Whether it's lack of communication with the player base or even just terrible implementation of new and old content, it is not worth it at all to start playing this game in 2022 -- for both the regular servers (heavily inclined to P2W) and the reboot (F2P) servers. Once again, STAY AWAY."

You can play this game for over 1000 hours and still not be close to end-game. It's fun for a little while (much less time than my personal time indicates), but don't waste a penny on this game. The game is designed so that you will only be able to keep up if you NEVER take a break, or you spend an absurd amount of money. There are multiple important items that are time-limited (e.g. Pets with auto-potion, auto-loot, and auto-buff... let me tell you, you NEED all 3 of these things once you are past level 200, the game is horrendous without them). You can acquire these things from events or from the cash shop, but either way you acquire them will have an expiration date, INCLUDING pets that cost $100. Speaking of the cash shop, you will also never be able to make your character look decent unless you spend money. There are some event reward cosmetics, but they all just look like clown attire.

If you do want to play, play on the Reboot server, make a Hyper Burning character, enjoy the early-to-mid game bosses (Lotus was the last boss I enjoyed fighting, most players will get bored way sooner than this), and then drop the game FOREVER. Or, you know, just play dozens of better games with the time that you would have wasted on this one."

I started playing this game when pirates came out. I used to love this game I really did. What I loved the most out of this game was the sense of being part of a community. The community is still active with an estimated 50,000-70,000 players but will continue to dwindle since less people join the game than there are leaving. I left because I didn't like the direction the game was taking.

I can't say if the game is still worth playing.. All but one server, the Reboot server, are pay to win. If you have the time to do mindless grinding then the Reboot server is for you (keep in mind that you cannot trade anything in this server). Find yourself a guild and hopefully you find some nice people to chat with. I don't recommend joining the non-reboot servers anymore as the majority of the old veterans are one of the most elitist and toxic players out there, and that's coming from the veteran player I am. Pretty much the normal servers are kept alive by the whales who spend tons of money in the game still. Anyone willing to pay can to be on top but I decided to not spend the money myself, it seems pointless and unfun instead of working towards progressing your character yourself.

One of the things I really disliked about this game was the introduction of the potential system. Potential widened the gap between rich and poor players. It divided the community even further. There are a ton of potential related items in the cash shop that give an unfair advantage to players with lots of money to drop in non-Reboot servers. Reboot is just a band-aid for the problem potentials created in this game. Reboot is a server Nexon created that solved many pay to win aspects, however this comes with many drawbacks, including the inability to trade with one another within the server. Another problem I saw was that Nexon was nerfing party related quests and raids, it was encouraging people to go solo instead of partying with other people which is what I loved from this game (as of today you'll rarely see anyone doing party quests, most people are grinding now instead of doing PQs/Boss Runs/Raids to level up). Now that the damage cap has been removed there is little reason to party with others to do stuff if you're decently funded. One other minor problem I saw is that Nexon created tons of servers, there was no reason to create more, the population wasn't even increasing and it further divided the playerbase. They finally merged many of the barren servers into single servers but are still even less populated than the top 3 populated non Reboot servers.

The game gets minor updates monthly with the occasional major update every now and then, so the game is still alive in that aspect. Thanks to Nexon Korea's ongoing support for the game, there's many more things to do than you could do in old MapleStory which is one of the few things this MMO has going.

I cannot recommend this MMO, but if you really want to try it out, go join the Reboot server, it is the most populated server and hopefully you find some nice people to chat with.

TL:DR
The game is extremely pay to win if you're not playing the Reboot server (keep in mind that you cannot trade in this server). I recommend joining the reboot server only if youre willing to try the game out. The game has an average of 50000-70000 players at the moment."
