I genuinely enjoy the game, but I feel that it is morally incorrect to recommend the game to others and downright evil to recommend the game to friends. The game itself is fun, and the skills and combat can feel very satisfying. Each of the many jobs offers a different play-style so players have some options with how they want to interact with the game.

The problem is that the game feels fun and inviting at first, but as soon as you start thinking ""Wow, I like this character, I wanna see how far I can go with it,"" Nexon has already won.

First, you have to get a character from level 1 to level 200. This will take a few days at first, but each character you do this with will take a shorter amount of time to reach level 200. If the first climb to level 200 already felt too grindy, I recommend stopping immediately because it will get much, much worse.

Each of the different jobs have a special skill called a ""Link Skill."" For some job, these link skills have only 2 levels. Getting level 1 in a link skill requires getting the character to level 70, and getting level 2 in a link skill requires getting the character to level 120. Some characters have a third level to their link skill which is gained at level 210.

Link skills are special in that they can be transferred or ""linked"" to another one of your characters in the same world. The character that the link skill comes from always has that link skill active whether it's linked to another character or not.

So if there is more than one job that you enjoy, you can have those characters give each other some link skills to make them a bit stronger. You may swap out link skills among your many characters up to 10 times per day, but after changing out a particular link skill 3 times, you have to spend some in-game currency if you want to swap that skill another 1 to 7 times.

Another mechanic of the game is called ""Legion."" You're given a special board called the Legion board, which looks like, and is, a large grid. You're also given a number called your legion rank. Your legion rank is equal to the combined total of all your levels on each character in a particular world. As you level up a character, its levels are added to your legion rank. Additionally, at certain level thresholds, you are given a ""legion block"" that represents that particular character. These blocks look like and work similarly to Tetris pieces.

These blocks can occupy a number of spaces on the legion board depending on the character's level. At level 60 a block can occupy one space, at level 100 a block can occupy two spaces, at level 140 a block can occupy three spaces, at level 200 a block can occupy four spaces, and at level 250 a block can occupy five spaces.

The legion board has spaces that grant stats when legion blocks are placed on them. So, for example, if you place a block with a size of 3 in the ""Str"" or ""Strength"" region of the board, each of your characters on that world will gain a flat +3 str or strength to their stats. Additionally, each character provides its own legion bonus that also depends on the number of spaces that it takes up on the board. For example, a Hero class will give a flat +10, +20, +40, +80, and +100 strength at levels 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively.

""Flat"" means that the stats gained aren't affected by any other modifiers.

Each of these legion ""bonuses"" that a particular character provides can only be gained once. So if you get two Hero classes to 100, the strength bonuses from that particular class won't stack and will only be counted once.

So now that I've taken the time to explain Link Skills and Legion, why should these systems matter with whether or not the game should be played?

Here's the problem: Reaching ""endgame"" or somewhere close to it in this game essentially means getting every possible class to either level 200 or level 210. Level 200 when the character has a level 2 link skill, and level 210 when the character has a level 3 link skill. This is to get every character to provide at four spaces minimum on the legion board while also getting every link skill to its maximum level.

Levels 200+ are usually considered to be where ""real game"" starts nowadays, and pushing just a single character from 200 to 250 takes considerable effort, to the point where getting a level 5 legion block with every character could be considered a lifetime achievement.

Getting a character beyond 250 (the level cap is currently 300) is generally only feasible with about 3-4 characters at best, so most a lot of emphasis is placed on about 1-2 characters, which are a player's ""mains.""

You need to get every character to 200 or 210 in order to funnel the majority of your time, energy, and resources into one single character.

And that's all before mentioning that most of the content is massively time-gated, enhancing equipment to be suitable for late-game or end-game is ""pay-to-win"" in regular worlds, and cosmetics you buy with REAL MONEY from the cash shop only last 90 DAYS. That's right, you don't get to keep the digital cosmetics that you spent money on.

You CAN get permanent cosmetics by purchasing and opening the ""Surprise Style Boxes"" (SSBs) in the cash shop, but it's completely random which cosmetic equipment you'll get. You could potentially spend hundreds and not get the cosmetics that you want from a particular ""SSB"" rotation. The same thing goes for royal hair and face coupons. If there's a particular hairstyle or face style you want and it's listed on a royal hair/face coupon? Gotta roll for it.

I play the game because I don't mind grinding and sometimes even enjoy it while listening to music. It's something I kinda do mindlessly when I want to relax for a while.

I love the lore of this game and I'm usually excited to learn new bits of info about it. The story and writing is often cheesy and silly, but I think that's part of its charm. The music in this game can be repetitive, but personally I don't really get tired of it and find some tracks to be relaxing and/or awesome. The combat can be very satisfying and a lot of fun. The game makes you feel powerful as you take down swarms and swarms of enemies per attack.

I think the game itself is fine and even enjoyable and fun. There's simply no other 2d game, or mmo that feels quite like maplestory, and that's why some players find it to be so difficult to leave. There are parts of it that I love and genuinely enjoy, but it's plagued by subtle and extremely predatory monetization practices and a company that goes to any lengths that it can to exploit and take advantage of the player-base. Nexon simply does not care about the players in the slightest, and tries to pretend that they care whenever something happens that might affect the money they're making.

To summarize: It's a great game plagued by a terrible company and terrible pay-to-win practices, and getting further and further in the game requires exponential levels of grinding.

I feel I must re-iterate that I feel that to recommend this game to others is to subject them to the same issues that the current player-base is dealing with and as such would be morally questionable.

Recommending the game a friend and having that friend actually get into and enjoy the game might end up ruining their life with the levels of grinding this game requires, and as such I think to do that to a friend would be downright evil.

If you read all this and think you'd be fine with it, then proceed, but again I CANNOT and WILL NOT recommend this game to others.

Enter at your own risk."

Just don't.
I know you're a veteran, but the game you once loved is gone.

Enjoy a dying buggy game with unbelievable server issues, plagued by a skeleton crew of a company operating on the soul purpose of exploiting you for your nostalgia.

You wanna progress? Fork over thousands of dollars, or spend literal years to try and catch up to people still doing years old content because they don't add any catch up mechanics outside of trashy events that are usually just copy paste of the same ♥♥♥♥ with a slightly different flavor.

The literal only reason there are still players is because of sunk cost fallacy and addiction.

IF you don't want to fort over the thousands of dollars to even begin the game on regular servers, you can choose to play on reboot and deal with the most annoying RNG filled trash systems without any ability to trade, so you're forced to grind for years to hit what some people would consider to be late game. It's a mobile game on steroids.

I have a thousand hours on steam, but probably 4x that on the Nexon launcher over the years. I'm still not even in the late game. Hell, I'd say I'm closer to being in the mid game still. No thanks.

I just got word from my old guild discord that they have the audacity to charge $100.00 (ONE HUNDRED) dollars for an in game pet, then on top of the $100.00 charge, they have the audacity to charge $15.00 MONTHLY just to use the thing.
""But why would anybody pay so much money for a pet? That's insane.""
Because this pet vacuums up all the items and money on the floor, increasing your efficiency. So if you want to have any chance of keeping up with the whales you gotta fork over the cash on both your main, and most likely you will want a Kanna alt so you gotta fork it up on that character too.

I do not recommend this game. I wouldn't even consider this a game, it's just a glorified gambling simulator, where you don't just gamble with your wallet, you do it with your time on top of that."

Nexon ruined Maplestory. My account got hacked and after contacting support on two separate occasions, I was told this was why it was banned and it wouldn't be unbanned. I was then told by support, ""Continued appeal to this account will be considered abuse of our support system, and may result in the removal of your ability to contact us.""

If you haven't already been playing this game for years don't bother picking it up. It is absolutely not fit for new players who aren't willing to put in hours upon hours of out of game research and even more hours of grinding to get to even an early game level. You will spend many hours getting your first character to level 200-205 and then realize that this character is worthless without 7-8 more characters getting to level 120 for a few decent link skills and then even more to 140 so that you can start building up legion. Most of the bosses you unlock getting to level 200 are borderline not doable without first getting a boss carry to get the gear that they drop to even do enough damage to start contributing in boss fights that drop the gear that you need. They set the game up to almost require boss carries but are currently testing out nerfs to the boss carry system as an extra ♥♥♥♥ you to its players. The game design is entirely based around grinding for low drop chance items from weekly bosses and mesos used to buy cubes to make that gear better along with an upgrade system designed to destroy your rare items to force you to grind again. Nexon is entirely out of touch with its community and makes stupid wide reaching changes on a whim even after explicitly stating that they wont (ie: totem removal). Nexon is consistently saying that players are progressing too fast compared to how long they think progress should take and start making changes to make the game even worse and grindier They are completely willing to neuter classes for no reason and remove many BiS items from the game making them completely unobtainable for anybody but veteran players who happened to pick it up before the removal. I genuinely believe that Nexon dislikes its community to a point where it is actively trying to drive players from its game by constantly making ♥♥♥♥♥♥ changes that make the overall player experience worse. I used to love this game I have so many fond memories of playing growing up and Nexon has done everything in its power to piss on those memories and make the game completely unrecognizable. ♥♥♥♥ you Nexon

Edit: Nexon just announced today that they are outright removing the Jett class from the game entirely. Jesus ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Christ Nexon are you purposely killing any tiny shred of good will you had from your community by displacing thousands of characters and people who loved this class? I guarantee whatever compensation they have for this change wont even come close to matching the time and effort Jett mains have spent leveling and gearing their characters. But let me guess 100 free nodestones and 100 free symbols that will hold them over. ♥♥♥♥ YOU AGAIN Nexon"

For claification sake, I've played this game since Beta and I love the overall animation and playstyle imaged as a 2D platformer. I guess this really hit a nostalgia nerve for me and my yearning for the old Mario Brothers mechanics. And while I hate to bash something I fell in love with, this is no longer the game that I use to know.

Back in the early days of MapleStory, you had your 4 standard classes: Mage, Warrior, Archer, Thief. Mage and Warrior had 3 subsets each; Archer and Thief had 2 subsets. Finding equipment and hanging out with friends was easy because there was just a few servers and not that many maps. The level cap was set as a crazy 200, but the mindless grinding wasn't so bad, cause you could easily be with your friends and if you found an equip you couldn't use, one of them could and vice versa.

But Maplestory grew. On the surface, you would think this is a good thing; more people = more friends = more equips. True, but Nexon saw this as an excellent opportunity to milk its players through microtransactions.

As the game grew, Nexon built more servers and maps, creating virtual spacial rifts between players. It became more and more difficult to get to the same map as a friend without using a teleport rock (a microtransaction item) or wasting a bunch of time. Nexon created pets, vanity items, world transfers, shops; all for real money. When that wasn't enough, they created more character types, those who couldn't share the cash shop items with the original characters, essentially urging players to rebuy cash items. The new characters also lead to the nerfing of some of the original characters under the guise of ""improved"" for rebalancing issues. Nexon raised the level cap to 250, milking players for even longer. They created a lottery system called gachapon for in-game items using real money, not to mention special event ""lotteries"".

Don't play Maplestory. It's not what it use to be. The fun is sucked out of it. Don't waste tons of time and money on it like I did."

MapleStory was one of the first MMORPG titles I've had the chance of playing, besides Runescape Classic (which was a looong time ago).

After a revisit of this game (after many years of on and off playing), as well as THOUSANDS of dollars spent, I cannot say I am willing to recommend this game.

FIrstly, MapleStory is one of the few 2D side-scrolling MMORPGs that try to mix 'cute' and 'breathtaking' together, and at times, they do it very well. Some landscapes are huge, the original lore and locations were very well done, and one can be trapped in the game's beauty for long periods of time. Heck, even getting lost in that game was fun. However, with the changes as of the last two to three years, a lot of the beauty has been lost. In order to cater to the broader generation of players who demand instant gratification, they have changed out most of the old expansive locations and replaced them with compacted versions - so that players can traverse the world much more quickly. However, by doing so, they've stuffed all the game's content into the newer maps, which makes most of the world appear small and claustrophobic.

The music score for this game is wonderful. Whether you're inside the forests of Ellinia, or exploring the depths of Ludibrium, the background music really amplifies the mystery and beauty the game world is trying to become.

The original MapleStory had a handful of classes, and each of them were unique, but overall balanced. Now, each large 'class update' seems to focus on newer 'Hero' characters, most who severely outclass the older counterparts in terms of damage and flashiness. In fact, there are so many different 'Heroes' nowadays, it saddens me to say that you'll rarely run into the older classes anymore, except in the case of Legacy worlds.

The Cash Shop isn't all too great either. In addition to the standard cosmetic items and EXP boosts that one would commonly find in Free-2-Play MMOs, there are also items which give you in game currency, some which would offer you lowered failure chances when upgrading items. The latter gives players who spend a huge lead over players who don't, and this is made obvious by the overly high prices those items fetch on the marketplace.

Combine that with a marketplace that doesn't let players open one without forking cash (and depending on how much cash you're willing to spend, it also determines whether you'll have to stay logged in to sell items)(players are only able to trade, so they'll have to solicit people in the market entrances) and a bad support team, I truly cannot recommend this game to anyone. MapleStory's golden days are long gone, and what's left is a carcass of what was once a masterpiece."

You know when you see the family at dinner at a restaurant and all of the kids are on their iPads and no one is talking? That's a lot like this game now. It's all about instant satisfaction, and a completely dead community. Yes, I did play Maplestory back in its prime (2005-2008), and yes I am bias, but this game is not for you if you are looking for the original Maplestory. Who knows, maybe if I never played this game before, I would think it is great. It's up to you, there are still some cool things about it. You do your own thing, level up super fast, do some bosses. I love the art style still, but Maplestory now feels super lonely, and nothing you do is rewarding anymore. I haven't died a single time (and yes i have more hours than you see on steam here, I've played 70+ hours a year back not through steam). Nothing is challenging, the game is total instant gratification that dissipates very quickly. There are no specific roles to the class you choose because every class does a ton of damage and has mob control. I digress... You can still have fun on this game, but if you are coming back expecting this game to be the Maplestory you knew back in the day, do not try it (this is an opinion not a fact, do what you want). If you're looking for a lonely grind game that is calming and comforting, this may be a game that you like. Try it and see. It's free to play, so try it and make your own opinion. I'm going to vote positive because I don't think it's a bad game, it's simply not my style like it once was."

The game looks and sounds amazing, but I don't think there's anything positive I can say about the gameplay.

Having played for years, I've seen Nexon devolve into a sad Cookie Clicker design philosophy. The game is now designed for you to sit in one place, on one map, holding the attack button for hours on end maybe with one or two other people, then change to a different map every couple levels and repeat the process. Or, heck, just pick one of the new characters with skills designed to kill everything on the screen indefinitely so you can literally AFK, then brag when you reach the max level with your Kanna by AFKing in a town and asking for +Fame because there's nothing else to do in the game but grind.

All character build variety has been removed so there is now only an illusion of player customization. The new content that gets added amounts to too many convoluted collect-a-thon holiday events and non-MMO subgames that no one asked for. Every now and then there's a story arc with animation and subpar English dubbing, which I don't begrudge them for trying, but big dramatic story arcs weren't what made this game popular. New incomplete features are added before old ones they started years ago are finished--the game has two bestiaries right now, both of which are buggy and incomplete. And that's not even to mention the broken quests, redundant maps, and frequent crashes.

No, from a game design standpoint, this is a mess. I'll admit I keep coming back to the game because the nostalgia is strong, but... as a critic delivering a critical analysis, I can't recommend this game."

I've played this game since I was 10 years old when it came out in america.

The best way to describe maplestory is a deep, deep hole out in the woods.
When you are bored and looking for something to do you fall into this hole.
At first you are scared, you panic and try to get out of the hole.
But slowly, you begin you like it in the hole.
You spend thousands of dollars on making this hole cooler, nicer, and do more dps.
You meet friends, lovers, and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ inside of this hole, it begins to feel like a community.
Then high school girl drama will go down, and you will sell all your gear and quit.
You will struggle to climb out of this hole. And finally....you're out.

You go back to the way your life was before, and you become happy again.

After a couple of months...you feel this craving...this...hunger...
You miss the hole. Sure, the hole has its ups and downs...but you...you were safe in the hole...you were...home...
So you go back, and thus begins the never ending downward spiral of your life.

I would never recommend this game to anyone:
1. This game is dead. Don't see any new players except for those new characters from old players trying to make ""legion""
2. The game mechanic is totally trash: Everything is random except your the chance of you booming your items which is already ridiculously hard to obtain. Want to get item? roll random boxes. Want to get stronger? Roll random stats. What are the chance to get what you want? 0.01%. How much you pay 2$ each roll. Money come from trees I guess.
3. Requires hours of farming/day and still doesn't get you anywhere because everything is so expensive. Funded players do solo bossing leave people with no gears cant progress. You CAN NOT play this game without spending your money (unless you are willing to spend years on it to be 1/6 of 3 months funded players).
4. Game bugs, game crashes
5. Not new players friendly.
6. Poor description of everything. From guide to the quest or event, items. I believe Indian people have even better English skills.
7. 30% success, 70% failure 0.7% destroy the item and you know what. its 100% hit on 0.7%. This feels like a scam
Tons more reason not to play this game."

I remember waking up as a kid, excited and eager to start up my dad's computer, hopping into the world of Maplestory, ready to take on whatever the game was going to throw at me that day. Needless to say, I was hooked. The cartoony yet oddly satisfying visuals, the huge world that was set before me, the deceptively simple class system, all things that I adored about it. For a while, I couldn't get enough of this game. It was my first MMO ever, and, to this day, probably still my favorite. Nothing comes close to the fun I had while killing mushrooms in the starting zone, slaying Balrogs on airships, destroying robots in Ludi, and finally, conquering Zakum. I made many friends, joined a slew of guilds, and mostly, just had fun. That's what videogames were about back when I played Maplestory, and in a sense, it seems like they've kind of lost that recently, although that's a different topic entirely. Maplestory now seems to be much more oversaturated in terms of classes and things to do, actually making it an overwhemingly experience rather than an extremely enjoyable one, one that I had when I played. Needless to say however, I still had a HUGE amount of fun with this game, and is hands-down one of the best experiences, if not THE best, I've had in gaming. I cannot speak to the community now, but when I was playing, it was a bunch of generous and fun loving people, one's that were willing to help others when they needed it. I miss Maplestory, specifically old Maplestory, even more specifically v.066, when things were simpler and I had a bunch of NX to spend on a different hairstyle.

I miss you Maplestory.
Thanks for giving me the game of a lifetime."

This game has the potential to be great. The concept of a 2D MMORPG that's all animated is pretty cool, and there's a lot of charm in this game. I currently have a level 230 Kinesis in Reboot (I use nexon launcher instead of steam) and I've (somewhat) enjoyed the grind up to that point. The community at least in the server I play in is large and thriving. However, this game has major problems that's been in the game for as long as I can remember.

Pros:
- Tons of options in terms of which class/job you want to play with + no big loss of time if you change your main (passive benefits for each char you play)
- Great and flashy animation for a lot of moves, some of the characters you can play can feel extremely fluid
- Customization options are massive (comes with a catch mentioned in cons)
- Large community
- Constant updates and events are happening

Cons:
- Tons and tons and tons of bugs (I cannot stress this enough), includes: buggy bossfights, broken UI, frequent game crashes, possible false ban, very laggy servers (in reboot, idk how it is in other servers)
- Non-reboot servers: very p2w, Reboot servers: overwhelmingly grindy
- Cosmetics is expensive/not worth the price: getting the look you want is based on rng a lot of times or it's time limited
- Nexon
Let me elaborate on the last point in the cons section. This company has been overwhelmingly incompetent when it comes to developing Maplestory. The company has been making extremely controversial balancing decisions for the game, as if they are purposely trying to slow down progression so as to increase the amount of money players have to put in this game. They have no transparency whatsoever. They often change the game without mentioning it in patch notes. They have also done nothing to fix the known problems of the game that has been here for the longest time.

My main point of this review is, if you want to play for nostalgia's sake or just to try it out as a completely new player, go for it. It's a nice experience to try this game (if you get lucky and don't get bugged out), and you can clearly see the charm this game has. However, I would STRONGLY recommend NOT to play this game if you are looking for a game to spend a lot of time in. Nexon has shown little to no interest in listening to the community and they probably never will. You would be better off playing in a different game where the company actually cares about their community and things are hell of a lot more polished than this game is."

I played Maple Story the very first day it was released to North America and since then the game has changed a ton.
The grind in the game was hard but when you got them levels you earned them and it was amazing hearing the stories of guys like Tiger making top Teir and Wizet really loved it's community. Normally in the old maple story you would see admins walking around talking to members as they passed by and it was exciting to see the community with their passion for the game making content like Dray86's Maple Kombat.

Then came Nexon who montized the hell out of the game, took the world that everyone loved and threw it all over the place then they made these hero classes that made the orignal classes completely useless of which had the most insanely high damage you've ever seen. Many of the cool dungeons in maple story became empty which is really sad because they was excellent.

Sadly maple story degressed into this sub par kind of game. I want Wizet back, I want my maple story.

Do I recommend it to you? No, Nexon is a greedy company but you won't really noticed how screwed up the game is unless you was there from the start. You won't notice all the cool stuff taken out because they'll try to blind you with high numbers and stupid classes to ego stroke your ♥♥♥♥."

After 3k hours on Steam and more on the Nexon client I think I can finally say that this is not the game I used to love.
As much as you and I want the old Maplestory back, it won't happen.

You'll probably enjoy the game for the first day or two, until you realise that all the enjoyment is gone and the RMT sucking machine that Nexon is starts crawling up your wallet with their expiring Cash-Shop items and absurd subscriptions such as VAC-Pets. (90€ ??? + 14€ per Month).
Nexon perfected the art of FOMO (Fear of missing out), forcing you to play more, more characters, more hours, more of everything you don't enjoy but MUST, else you miss out on your gear that is relevant for 4 months before something new and shiny comes out. Over and over again.


Please don't do it to yourself and try finding something else to play. Playing nothing is probably a better choice than downloading and starting this game."

I honestly enjoyed this game ever since I started this game as a kid back when it first came out like in 2007 or so on global. I used the same account, linked it to Steam, and returned occasionally to play whenever a big event is being held like Hyper Burning. But now my yearly routine ended after getting a random auto ban for ""suspicious activity for hacking and botting.""

All I do is dailies and weekly bosses on my burning character. And right now they have some star event where you just sit on the chair and AFK for 30 minutes. Which I did, while alt-tabbed playing a different game or browse the web only to get auto banned. I tried to appeal and their senior GM said i violated their Terms of Use. I kept trying to get it sorted out but all the junior GMs refused to help and said their senior GM already checked my ticket and denied me. Absolutely no help in proving my innocence because my character just leveled off of dailies and only used event rewards.

Awful way to quit a game but its just depressing how I can get treated this way after playing the game legit for so long.

Also the nexon account linked to my Steam account will haunt me forever lol."

Maplestory is like an abusive relationship.
Ever since I was a wee young lass, back in 2007, I've been unable to stay away, and I have no clue why. Sure, nostalgia is the main factor, but there are so many other games I played back then that don't keep me coming back as often. No matter how many times I uninstall it, it ends up on my computer again sometime between a few months and a year later. I've never even made it far; most of the time I get a character to level 50 and see some other shiny class I want to try out, and so I have quite a few 1/5th leveled characters that I can never seem to get past level 50. And yet I keep coming back.
10/10 would have no clue why I still play this game again"

I remember playing this game since I was maybe 6 or 7 years old and let me tell y'all, it was AN AMAZING EXPERIENCE. I remember the days of dexless assassins, strength mages and MANO. Remember when old time Maplestory required you to walk all the way to the corresponding town to the job that you wanted to be because you didn't make enough meses fighting snails and orange mushrooms on Maple Island? Remember when you wanted to be a warrior and then walking up to Perion, you got f*cked by a Jr. Boogie?

Yeah this Maplestory No longer exists

You know what this new Maplestory is now? It's now revolved around you basically making every single class in the game and leveling them up to 250 if you want to min max the sh*t out of the game because they provide some pretty dam crucial Link Skills which can be equipped to your other characters for bonus exp, damage, stats, etc.. Okay, maybe you don't have to get every class to 250, but, there are multiple classes where you need to level them up, in order for making other classes even easier to level.

Okay, maybe this doesn't seem to bad itself and maybe you like leveling other classes and experiencing their other skills, THAT'S FINE. It starts to get extremely tedious, when just about everything you want to do requires you to actually ""progress"" in the game. I put quotations around progress because the way that you progress in this game is by raising your main stat for whatever class you are playing.

NOW HERE'S WHERE THE BULK OF THE GAME STARTS. You've spent countless hours leveling multiple characters to 140, but now on your ""Main"" you really need to start pushing levels and getting stronger. Guess what? You need to basically GAMBLE to increase your stats. Look up CUBING, this mechanic in my opinion is relatively ""okay"", but the real struggle is STAR FORCING you godam equipment. Okay gambling? to increase the strength f your equipment? Hey guess what? IT'S GODAM TERRIBLE, I have a level 238 Buccaneer doing dialies/weeklies as well as a hyperburning 241 shadower doing dailies/weeklies. This is including bosses, I had procured around 10 billion mesos, for some thats a lot, for other veteran players, those are rookie numbers. From my perspective, this is 1 and ahalf months worth of work, I've been saving up because I knew there was a STAR FORCE event coming up. I will not waste time explaining any further because other players know the struggle. I SPENT ALL THAT MONEY TRYING TO STAR FORCE MY CRA TOP AND BOTTOM FROM 17 STARS TO 20 STARS, A MEASLY 6 STARS IN GENERAL. Sure okay some players will say that's some small amount I saved, but guess what? I SPENT A MONTH AND A HALF PREPARING. All to get a measly what, 400 extra main stat? And guess what? that's not even the end of trying to rank up your gear, I didn't explain it clearly earlier, but it costs yo MONEY to rank up your gear as well as SOME BS FAKE PERCENTAGE CHANCE to rank up, it might say you have 90% chance to rank up, but guess what, YOU FAIL THAT ♥♥♥♥ TWICE IN A ROW, 90% MY ASS NEXON, SHOW THE REAL STATS.

Well, I may be under the influence at the time of this writing, but I think my point has been made. FIX YOUR GODAM GACHA GATED PROGRESSION NEXON.

As someone who has played MS since the open beta ended way back when up til a few months ago, and even played the Korean, Japanese and SEA servers at different points in time, I think I can give a prety good overview.

A lot of people are blinded by nostalgia when it comes to this game. You may even see people saying that the game was better back when it took 12 hours to lvl up at lvl 73, which is absolutely absurd. The grind to even play your character back then was absolutely ridiculous. The only thing that pre-Big Bang Maplestory had that this version now doesn't is the sense of community and life that was everywhere. People will say that there isn't a sense of community now and that people don't help each other which is untrue. The community just isn't at the low levels, low levels meaning anything below 200. The players are still very friendly and helpful, and will go out of their way to party you if you have quests on the same map, and the Chu~Chu Island PQ at lvl 210 is a bunch of fun. Except for birdsharks. ♥♥♥♥ birdsharks.
You've seen me say lvl 200 and 210 previously, so how many levels are there? 250. There are 250 lvls in this game and at no time does the progression ever not give you rewards. 1-140 give you skill points, 141-200 give you hyper skills, 141-250 give you hyper ability points, and every 6 levels after 200 gives you an extra node slot. The first 200 lvls fly by, there are people that can do them in 8 hours and for some it'll take a few weeks. Most notably though is the insane Exp curve. At lvl 200 the Exp required to level goes from about an hour or two to 4 hours or more, especially if you play on Reboot and train in the Arcane maps before getting the 1,5x Arcane force multiplier from the daily quests. And the grind only gets more and more difficult. Previously I mentioned that at lvl 73 pre-Big Bang you could take 10+ hours to level up. Post Big Bang getting from 203-204 takes about as long without the Arcane force multiplier affecting your damage and letting you grind at better mobs. Because as an unfunded character you're going to be grinding at either Scrapyard or the first area of Vanishing Journey for a good 2 or so weeks if you don't miss any Vanishing Journey daily quests. Later on you can expect 2% exp per hour, which, considering the lvl requirements of later areas like Arcana, is going to take you months.
As for the social aspect of the game now, joining a good, active guild is necessary. If you don't join a good, active guild, on Reboot especially, your progression past 200 will be absolutely glacial. You need a good guild to do end game bosses with and to get decent equipment, which is doubly true for Commerci PQ because most people aren't going to risk having a random in their party looting a class specific weapon or mega rare item that's untradeable on Reboot and worth a bunch on regular servers. So basically, you have to do your social networking and join a community of good players.
Maplestory is very much a long term MMO. You have to get to a threshold level to get into the community, which is really only a matter of time, your progression is measured more in a few months at time than in days or weeks and there is something to do every single day you log in. Most people who say that Pre-Big Bang was better doesn't remember how it used to be and they would quit it if they played it after they played the version that exists now. In summation, ♥♥♥♥ Pre-Big Bang.

Onto the actual game.
The differences between the Korean version and the North American version are staggering, less so with the Japanese and even less with the SEA version. So I'll start off with the easiest.
SEA:
SEA, compared to NA, or Global, used to be different in that they would receive patches ahead of time of NA. To my knowledge this is not true anymore. The only real advantage SEA has is that it has a map called Parkin Lot which makes lvling to 200 even easier. Beyond that, the SEA economy is in absolute shambles and the Cash Shop aspect there is even worse.
JP:
It's been years and years since I've played the JP version or even heard talk of it but from what I recall JP players got 10% more base experience and they have a toad boss that NA doesn't.
KR:
This is the best version of the game. KR Maple does not have Gollux, it does not have Commerci, it does not have ghost exorcist badge, and most importantly it does not have Kannas. So why is this version the best? Because it is the least P2W. The mileage system of KR Maple allows you to buy anything from the Cash Shop, the fact that you can get mileage from bosses, from epic boss spawns, and from frequent events means that you can get pretty much anything you want. You can also buy permanent Cash items either from the Cash Shop or from the fantastic economy. The economy there is wonderful and not crazily inflated. If I remember correctly 1bil mesos there is about $60 USD, which is much much better than any other economy on any other version. The events on this version are frequent and this version gets content the fastest and most frequently as well. The last big difference is that this version has flames on equipment, which is another sort of equipment modifier. I would still not recommend playing this version though unless you can understand Korean and are willing to practice how to type Korean characters. There are a few reasons for this, mainly the English community there is dying and there are only a handful of English speaking players left, you need to know how to type Korean characters to even log into the game and you need them later on to answer anti-botting captchas that randomly pop up. It's fairly simple though to learn, you can learn with a few hours of practice and be fine. The biggest reason I wouldn't recommend this version though is that you have to buy a premade account off of a shady Chinese website for $10.

Maplestory is a pretty fun, mindless game. If you can immerse yourself in the game, you'll have a great time. As is, before you even start the game you have to choose what you'll invest. Do you want to invest time or money into the game? If time, go to Reboot, if not go to any regular server. If you play Korean MS, don't play Reboot.
Now that you've gotten through that, if you're playing on not-KMS (Korean Maplestory) make a Kanna, especially if you're on Reboot, if you're on Reboot playing a Kanna and getting it to at least lvl 150 is mandatory so you can farm gold at a decent rate.
Now that you've gotten your Kanna up to a decent lvl to farm Mesos you can choose what your main class will be. There are a bunch of cool classes like Cadenas and Crossbowmen and what not. Literally any class is viable for end game bosses like Lucid, Damien, Lotus, etc. except for Bishops and Kannas because they DPS way too slowly and bring nothing to boss fights. Ironically Bishops and Kannas are most valuable for grinding lvls and mesos.
Great, so you've brought your main to lvl 200, gotten your Kanna up to acceptable farming rates, and now you're looking for stuff to do inbetween Arcane River dailies, farming for %meso gear and bosses. This is where you go make link and union mules, which gives you a chance to play other classes without feeling like you're wasting time not playing on your main. If you do get to the point where you're making mules for Union get your mules to 141 first for the most convenient Tier of Union and once you have all of them done go back around and get them to 200 for Grand Master Union.

Basically everything you do in this game will eventually get you stronger. Sure you could get even stronger if you spent more money or time, but you'll get there eventually any way. Play it until you get bored, quit for a while then come back and do it again for a bit. You get to scratch your itch of playing a decent, mindless MMO with others and your progression isn't invalidated by new stuff that comes out unless there's a complete overhaul again like Big Bang."

I adored this game as a kid and nostalgia keeps me coming back but there's some glaring problems with it.

First, the good:

-The game mechanics feel fun. Hitting mobs, using skills and running around the mob is exciting and satisfying. The characters are super cute, the NPCs are designed well and every character has their own sort of story (except the original explorers). I actually really enjoyed going through every characters individual starting quests. For a few brief moments, it did feel like a fun little RPG. I also really enjoy the optional aesthetics they created in the cash shop. I think the skins are really charming, the pets are cute and the hair styles are fun.

Now the bad, which is pretty much everything else.

-Old quests are obsolete now. There used to be quests that gave you a cape or unique shoes and everyone wanted to do them. It felt like a little adventure, like an actual RPG. Jane Doe needed help getting medicine and she gives you a cape as gratitude. But now, there are only about 3-5 quests until level 80 that you can do that are worth it. Low level equipment is garbage because you get to level 100 so fast. Everyone just does the theme dungeon because its the best way to get experience, so why do any other quests? I consider bad game design when developers just write code over their old code, and don't maintain that old code. If other quests aren't worth it, no one will do them and it's just a waste of space.

-They come out with a new hero every now and then, and it makes other classes so unrewarding to play, because if one class does so much better, why even play the old ones? In other RPGs, other status such as defense is worth looking into. But due to the fact that you basically have to grind to lvl 100 to do anything fun, the thing that matters is damage output. Don't get me wrong, other classes are viable (not awful, just not good) it's just that when a new class comes out, it does so much more with such little resources, it doesn't feel like you should ever revisit old characters.

-Mesos have been inflated and pets feel mandatory. Old maple used to have a bustling economy . It forced you to purchase a shop if you ever wanted to make real mesos. Then you had to re-invest that money into scrolls for a chance to make your items better. I felt like that was truly pay to win. But now, you can simply increase your equipment's stat through star enhancement, so I can feel powerful without spending nx cash. I appreciate this change but it made way for new problems. I need A LOT of mesos to deck out everything and you can do that by doing certain boss fights but until level 120 you get the money by picking up mesos. That's so annoying to do without a pet, which requires money.

-Another scummy tactic that nexon has used to get money is the idea of MVP. There used to be 2x EXP coupons, which imo was fair. You pay a little extra and you level up faster. You can still level just fine on your own, the 2x felt optional to me. But they took that out now and you get the 2x coupons to give away if you spend enough NX. Because of server abandonment issues, character world transfers are only available through a loot box mechanic system, which is a super scummy way of getting your players to spend more money. To get the items you want, you have to keep wasting more money.

-They re-worked how hair coupons work to make more money. Old maple had all hair types at your disposal. You had to check what city the hair was available in and then go to the city, purchase it, and you're good to go. Now, there are only two hair coupons. One is random royal hair coupon and the other one is a choice coupon. Theres so many hair styles but they all go on rotation, so the one you want might not be available until next month. This means if you create a character, and want to change the hair style you HAVE TO choose and buy whatever is in stock at the moment. This means if you dont like the hair your character has, you have to change it to whats available then spend money to buy hair again when the one style you like comes out.

-There are bugs everywhere. I don't know if it's bad coding but they seem to only rewrite code on top of existing code. For example, their text UI stays open when another text UI opens. The search bar for their map stops working every once in a while. If I can't find anything, the world map crashes. Upon even opening maplestory, it fails about 30% of the time and I have to re-launch it. When I try to click on a spot in a map, a pop up says 'you dont have a teleport rock' then navigation opens. It feels like the developers were lazy and just didnt code that out. Just write 'if (rock not in inventory) then (dont show pop up)'. But perhaps theres too much spaghetti code and they can't write over it. It happens with projects that have too many developers or projects that are too old.

-The UI is TERRIBLE. My god. It's 2020 as I write this review and the UI is so ♥♥♥♥♥♥ awful. As soon as you finish your base quest and you're free to do what you want, there's so much garbage stuffed in your face. But this is a common flaw I see in a lot of MMOs. The developers think players want every button for guild, quests, mining, etc available to them, without considering how much it clutters a screen. How are new players supposed to come to this game without being overwhelmed? To get into it, you pretty much have to have a friend to guide you through it.

-The worst thing they did, imo, was completely nerf low level party quests. They replaced everything with theme dungeons, which give good exp but the reason why maple was so popular before was because of the social aspect. I had to do ludi PQ, or kerning PQ and it was super fun. I met people and made friends, which made me want to continue to play. PQs gave players reason to interact. The social aspect of MMOs are what make MMOs enjoyable and nexon kind of just ruined that.

Overall: greedy company ruined this game. Don't play unless for the nostalgia.

Updated Edit: Worth playing casually, but that's it. Don't spend money on this game. Log in and have some fun, but this game isn't worth giving to the company. Some of the most disgusting tactics I've seen with horrible customer service. Events are buggy, new players have a hard time progressing, everything is RNG. Use it as an afk machine for when youre watching something or doing something on the side.

Still buggy with little QOL improvements. Why does my item menu go transparent when im being hit by a mob? Take that garbage out."

This game has gambling mechanics, and these gambling mechanics are necessary for progress. If you play on a ""regular server"", you can pay real money to gamble for progress. If you play the ""Reboot server"", you earn in-game currency through gameplay, and you gamble with that instead.
If you're like me, if you understand statistics, if you're not vulnerable to gambling addiction, if you play Reboot, you can play this game with no problems.
If you are vulnerable to gambling addiction, if you don't rigorously keep track of your spending, this game can hurt you for real, and hard. There is some seriously negativity in this game's player base, because some people have been seriously hurt financially by this game. Some people continue to be hurt by this game.

That's why I'll never recommend this game to anyone. If you're not vulnerable to gambling addiction, this game has a lot of content and is a lot of fun, and it's even fun free2play.

It's a good game overall, but before you Invest your Time and Money to this Maple Journey, I would warn you First.

This game is all about RNG, enhancement of your Gear requires that, drop of equip requires that, and upgrading Gear potential requires that. Worst of all, you can get banned in a Totally Random time at totally random moment. PURE RNG.

and once you get banned even if you didn't hack or anything, you lost all your rights.

Investigation team doesn't care if you hacked or not, they only care if anything triggered their ♥♥♥♥♥♥ anti-hack system.
while real hackers hacking all they want.

And the moment you get falsely banned. You WON""T be able to recover anything, not even the NX you charged an hour ago before you get banned.

NO REFUND TO HACKERS, they said. even if you didn't hack.

It's a great game, great art and music, but it's been ran by notorious Nexon .

Don't invest your time and money on this , Read their ToS. They can literally Suspend,Delete,Ban your account with no reason, it's written there !"

So yeah, I genuinely cannot recommend this game as of right now. Maybe in the future I will change my review on Maplestory again. I have many more hours on the Nexon client.

Nexon KR has decided that the global release should be more in line with the Korean client (nothing wrong necessarily). But Nexon NA (works as publisher for the global version) have been straight up lying to the players about why choices have been made. Just look up ""2x drop coupons GMS"" on YouTube and listen to explanations by CopperSan or Scardor. In short, every kind of strategy or item that could be beneficial for player progression is either being removed or nerfed into oblivion. Everything that made the global release its own game, is being removed slowly for the past ~2 years. Which really does suck. Korean, NA and EU are very different clients that need to be catered differently. It's too bad because there is no other game like MapleStory. I really like the chibi characters and cutesie look of the game. Yeah, the game is grindy, always has been. But big numbers make my lizard brain tingle in a good way.

Although these last points really suck, I would still play the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game if it weren't for Nexon NA incompetent communication. Every single point of interest that needs addressing, either happens too late or doesn't happen at all. But, let's say communication about a certain delicate topic happens, Nexon NA gets caught lying about reasoning or ""data"". This has happened a lot of times in the last ~4 years. If you don't believe me, go to r/MapleStory and sort by ""All Time Top"". You will find threads stacked on top of each other about boycotts and their reasoning. Literally everytime the number 1 argument is the barren communication between Nexon NA and the community. This year, for the first time, Maplestory Global had a roadmap released. The roadmap was a joke and Nexon didn't comply with their own planning, again no communication about it.

I really hope Nexon & Nexon NA get their ♥♥♥♥ together and start looking at ways to engage more with the community behind the global release. These people are literally the most engaged group of people I have seen in a long time. So, after this long rant, just don't play it. It's not worth it, because you literally never know what might happen next. It could be you just loose 6 months of progression because the stupid starforce system or because Nexon decided to nerf your class to the ground without warning. I didn't talk about the enhancing system at all in this review, but if you think BDO or POE is awful, just wait until you learn you could loose 2~3 months of progression by booming an item. So, no stale progression, like LA, actually loosing progression.

I have no idea if Steam will say at all if I've played Maplestory but I promise you all I have put a lot of time into this game and absolutely loved every minute. Unfortunately Maplestory just became completely uninteresting since I've tried to relive it. And it makes me really sad. Maplestory originally had the classes we all see in every MMO (no matter how hard other MMO's try to make it different) and of course also like every MMO it started off simple. One big difference of course was the fact that it was a 2D sidescrolling MMOPRG and it's done so beautifully. You can make different faces at people depending on how you feel which was really fun before the cliche ""lol"" and ""lmao"" texts we all now universally know. Getting weapons was also a little more unique since most MMO's just milk weapons. Now a lot of MMORPG's have bows with unlimited arrows and guns with unlimited bullets. Maplestory made you buy arrows and throwing stars/shuriken if you wanted to be a ranged class. And Mesos (Maplestory currency) was hard to come by at low levels making it even more challenging since you had to actually ask for money from time to time.

When I originally loved this amazing piece of gaming art you had to use a taxi to get to different cities (which you still do at least) and use flying boats to get to different continents. This was a huge deal because it allowed you to just settle down for a short time and actually talk to people; and listen to music along the way. Now this is not the case. There were no overpowered and annoyingly voice acted 'Hero' classes that literally kill everything in their paths with ease. You really had to work to get more powerful back then and you also needed to manually know what your stats needed to be for your class. Maplestory added more powerful classes over time but they were never 'Hero' status. Yes they got more powerful due to their unique skills compared to the default classes; however you still needed to start off as a default class and work your way into the more unique class you selected and leveling was still just as hard for you as the rest.

The music is still the same Maplestory anime music I know and love. I just wish it could be heard with the game I knew and loved. For all you new players out there reading this review it'll mean close to nothing probably. To shorten what I just said: Maplestory used to be a surprisingly vast game filled with lots of social opportunity and hours upon hours of questing and leveling. It's a shell of its former self now. This does not mean I say it's a bad game. It's still good and worth the try. But unfortunately you have missed the golden age that was Maplestory. It's all milked down and I can't recommend it in its state now. What used to take a couple weeks to a month takes less than a day now. Bosses that originally required a full team can easily be defeated solo and the monsters that were originally intimidating and powerful are powerless. The challenge is gone. I will miss you Maplestory."

Here is an honest review of this game

Pros:
-Very well-made and rare 2D style, very refreshing
-Beautiful Art in weapons, monsters, maps and landscapes
-Amazing original sound tracks that masterfully complements the Art
-Interesting story and worldbuilding
-Multiple options to spend your time in game, that although grindy can be a lot of fun
-Distinct and balanced classes for the player to choose
-Active developers and moderators with great anniversary and seasonal events
-Fair and mostly cosmetic real money transactions that you don’t need to advance to a decent level

Cons:
All of the Pros points are no longer true in recent times, and are only alive in the memory of the og players that you can hear whisper “Look How They Massacred My Boy…”

This Game WAS a MSTERPICE in all its extent but Nexon has found a way to corrupt and butcher one of the best mmorpg games ever made and completely alienate and divide their player base

Let me state the current state of the Pros points
-Very well-made and rare 2D style – Only still true because they can’t mess this one up, but is becoming irrelevant as time passes
-Beautiful Art in weapons, monsters, maps and landscapes – becoming more and more pixel noise on the screen with no much thought put into it, the difference with the old and original content is very palpable, and the similarities makes it look as if the original developers/artists could sue the new ones for copyright
-Amazing original sound tracks that masterfully complement the Art – The new music is not bad but nowhere near the level of the iconic masterpieces that the original songs on the old maps represent and felt when played, the sheer amount of personality added via music was amazing
-Interesting story and worldbuilding – long gone, the story has been changed, made irrelevant and poorly expanded to the point where you cant make sense of all the mess, far from the simple yet interesting story that would make you want to complete the main quest line, reduced to a nuisance you have to complete to advance your class
-Multiple options to spend your time in game – The game is now complete grind, this was also somewhat true before, but now it has been reduced to very few maps where you sit and spam a single wide area attack for hours in the same spot with the few classes that allow you to, other classes that cannot do this are simply unviable.
There are no options, no variation, no nothing, but the same map with the same monster and same attack, every 10 levels until you move to the next.
-Distinct and balanced classes for the player to choose - new classes completely overpowered the original ones, instead of creating new concepts, mechanics, weapons and story they simply took the style and roles the og classes fulfilled and raised the power level in every aspect, while thinking the player wouldn’t notice the lazy copy paste under a different label, they did noticied.
Again, there are no options, no variation, no nothing, all the different ways to build you character and play have been removed from the game, even though we have many times the number of classes the game had years ago it feels like you have less options because only a few classes are viable now, with the building path being set in stone, there is only optimal build and complete trash, there is no in between.
-Active developers and moderators with great anniversary and seasonal events – gone, events are mostly repetition of what has been done before and the lack of community is determining to the success of the event, reduced to more solo grind
-Fair and mostly cosmetic real money transactions that you don’t need to advance to a decent level.
Finally, the worst part of all, pay-to-win is the law that governs this game now, like so many other famous games pay-to-win butchered the original cash system and made it impossible to play end game content without milking the player in some way, constantly forcing players to expend a large amount of money or lag behind the rest

The worst part is that every negative aspect of pay to win, has been multiplied by the HUGHE amount of RNG that is involved in the process, every item you’re forced to buy is linked to an awful RNG mechanic know as ‘success rate’ everything that enhances your gear has a success rate awfully low or is plane lottery with the thing you want having less than 1% chance to happen, causing players to buy hundreds of items just to get the one thing they wanted in the first place

In Resume this game was a masterpiece a decade ago, today the only people playing do it just for nostalgia, they go the old areas and listen to the good old music and once-great places now wastelands, or have spent so much they feel like they can’t quit now, or are completley new and play for a while until they realise what is underneed this beautiful shell of a game that now is best used as an example to new games and companies on how not to run and maintain a game/brand."

Ok, so I have played a decently amount of time for this game... i mean, 4000 hours...

Pros:
-Waifu bosses
-(reboot server is the only aspect that isnt p2w)

Cons:
-need pay-to-win gears to get to and beat waifu bosses

-boring events and / or recycled events

-dev doesnt listen to the community (they recently did a survey on r/maplestory, however, every person's concern were either skimmed over or just blatantly ignored, instead the devs addressed the issue by making up their own opinions. Basically a survey of wasting players 5mins)

-community manager sucks at communicating (r/maplestory hates the community manager because he has blatantly banned a player on the official forums reason being the player criticized the CM on reddit...like really dude?)

-no transparency between devs and the community (theres no communication channel between the CM and the community unlike every other game this age, theres no weekly stream, theres no dev logs, theres no updates on if any of the glitches/issues are being worked on, NOTHING)

-toxic community

-censor words in the game are just ridiculous, ""my first time"" is censored...

-grind fest (surely it's been made easier to level from 1-200, however, most end game content is located at lv 220, to put in perspective, lv 219-220 is leveling 1-200 4 times)

-useless quests, an insane amount of useless quests (what's even worse is the rewards doesn't even scale to level, and the rewards are straight up fodder made for NPC or tossing it away, consequently you can progress in the game without doing a single quest, whats even better i you'll lag LESS if you dont do them)

-game is filled with hackers, botters, and cash farmers (aka the economy in the game is absolutely horrible, and it isnt that easy to get money either)

-game masters doesnt do jack with hackers (to top it off, game masters themselves dont know how to play the game, i.e. during GM events, they dont even know the censorship is outta whack in the game (you can see the words not censored on your side, but on other people's screen it's censored), doesnt know how to cancel buffs via right click)

-very easy to hack in and will result with no consequences whatsoever

overall, a mediocre, less-than-average game to waste time in but not good enough to stick around if youre coming back or wanting to try this game out

edit: for a game that's been out for more than 10 years, it's very glitchy, it's very unstable, it crashes way too much, and the devs have said they are ""looking into it"" for the past 5 years and nothings changed"

I used to play this game in early high school, damn near almost 20 years ago. I wanted to come back and relive some memories. I expected a lot to have changed throughout the game, but I didn't expect the first 2 hours of the ""explorer"" story, the one you want to play for the most classic experience, to be an endless barrage of talking, poor voice acting, a generic ""evil mage"" story and being teleported to random places by questgivers. I'm supposed to be an ""explorer"". Why are questgivers teleporting me to precisely where I need to be for a quest? What's the point of exploring? And then when I get there, it's just more unskippable scenes and more talking.

I just want to play the game, bro. Not listen to some grown adult get a job at Nexon play out their 20 year old Maple Story self-insert fan fiction. I have never been so bored in my life. I thought that whole section was a tutorial, then I reached my SECOND (??????) Job Advancement? I don't even remember leveling up. I would sit there, talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and, and then suddenly, with no real notification, I'm level 30 and have like 120 unspent skill points?

I thought skill advancement was supposed to be reward for playing the game, not just something that you passively accumulate in between conversations with cringy chibi anime characters.

If you played this game a very long time ago, and looking for that nostalgia kick, don't even bother. Go on Youtube and watch old videos of what Maple Story used to be."

I really can't recommend it right now, but its the best game in the world.
I talk about 2004-2006 MapleStory, the game that was an adventure to go and meet new people
People were nice and funny, At certain points, it was a must to play with people to advance.
It's really the summary of summaries about maple, but I think you got me.

Nowadays maple is bitter, cold ,
you basically play a singleplayer game that sits on an online service.
Rarely you'll find someone that will be interested in communication.

World of warcraft classic server was announced a month ago.
The community knew the old wow was what they wanted to play and they fought for it.
I think it's our time to fight for our lovely game too.

Go play old server instead, you'll get the feeling I got in about 10 minutes into the game."

While fun overall leveling and unique for it's 2D style, the game as a lot of issues, and it's why I would not recommend it. You're free (well kind of) to try it and form your own opinion but this is just me.


Biggest cons in my opinion:

You are forced to get carried for the good loot that you would need to do the bosses with, which is silly. The alternative is to play the OP classes that doesn't require much insane gearing.

Potential on items is so rare it's stupid, and since you need to potential all your gear but only have a small chance to actually succeed the scrolls.

You need to buy pets with real money to loot items for you, otherwise it's just tedious to get the item drops, and they are not permanent duration.

A lot of quests don't have any good guidance as to what to do next or where to go, end up alt tabbing to see what needs to be done, and a lot of times guides aren't up to date so it's extra difficult.

Prequests are sometimes long, annoying and or not rewarding to unlock bosses. And guess what, you need to redo all of them if you want to play those on another character.

Server issues and maintenance downtime are often ludicrous, For example today is a big event arrival and only 1-3 very unstable servers are usable and sometimes the game won't even launch.

The resolution is quite low, so when you're on a higher native resolution and tabbing out it's really annoying.

Most of the clicking with the mouse is then cluncky and if you're slightly inaccurate the action won't perform. Such as dialogue boxes and menus and so on.

You need to play many characters at high levels before getting more damage for endgame that is somewhat required for certain classes.

I have probably 2000+ hours before this game even hit Steam. Everyone is absolutely correct in saying this game is a husk of its former self. Big Bang changed it forever, however... I just can't stop coming back. On and off occassionally over the years. Maybe it's nostalgia, maybe it's like a bad relationship where you tend to block out the bad and only see the good. The company isn't much better either. I started playing in 2006, and still to this day can't stop finding my mind wavering back to it every so often. Its like that ex you just can't stop texting, but she herself isn't really wanting to let you leave either.

MapleStory,Not Recommended,280.4,"Posted: December 12, 2014
Review as follows: Simple version up top, detailed on ""read more"". Note: I have played this game for well over 2,000+ hours over the years, and long before it was released on steam; how I ever racked up that many hours I will never know, but the game is not worth even 1 hour of your playtime.

The good:
A classic 2D action platformer
Many character classes
Many areas to explore
The Bad
Character classes are horribly balanced
Classes do not particularly stand out from each other (their niche's all blur together now)
There is a huge problem with botters and hackers (people using cheats)

On to the detailed and truely abominable things that make this game horrendous, almost beyond words.


The simple act of looting is to push the ""loot"" button which is both ""Z"" and the numpad 0. As you progress through the game the method for fighting ""mobs"" is at the bucket loads, you will be killing 4~12 monsters within every 5 seconds. Each monster drops 2~4 items which are money, a misc monster drop, a potion, and a ""ticket fragment"" of sorts to do a special instance run that is always dead (no one does them.). So for every item you want to pickup, you must push ""Z"" and you will find that you will quickly be pushing that key hundreds if not THOUSANDS of times every few minutes. And if you dont loot those items you make essentially no money. The entire economy is seriously inflated to begin with too. If you want looting to be convenient be prepared to shell out about $30~$40 every 90 days for a pet and its ""gear"" to make it run around to loot things for you.

You are forced to struggle with inventory space. At first you may think that you have plenty of space, but you quickly find out that the ""Use"" items and ""misc"" tabs will quickly be overlowing from NECESSARY items (the several hundred or THOUSAND potions you will be carrying, and have to replace every few hours or so). while the ETC slot will be filled with quest items, materials for crafting, and of course the hoards of monster drops you will be picking up (which usually only stack up to 200).

Items you buy with $$ are NOT account-wide. They use a nonsense ""cash inventory"" system which is only shared with other characters of the same class (except in some rare caes like the ""adventurer"" series of classes or the ""cygnus knights."" However after the addition of the resistance they have their own shared cash inventory as well. You may think that is good enough but it IS NOT! because there are 2x of all that combined in classes that have a cash inventory shared only with other characters of the same class (which is POINTLESS because then you would be leveling up the exact same thing all over again; as each class only has 1 build, a special exception is made few 2 or 3 classes which can be either 1 element or another). Please note I am not talking about how a magician splits off into ice/lightning or fire/poison, I am referring to how a single class with a single skillset can have skills you wont want to invest in because they have no real part in the only effective way to create your character; which can be ever so important as there are skills in future advancements that require some certain skills to be Maxed.).

They purposefully make things that should be everyday and easy access functions, exceedingly hard. For example, if you want to sell ANYTHING to ANY players, you want to go to the ""free market"" with about 50 other people, all spamming trying to sell things. If you want to sell ANYTHING as easily as it should be, you have to spend about ~$5 to buy a shop that your character has to man (lasts 90 days) just to sell things, which is horrendous in itself because you cant play the game, and it has a tendency to , and so hard you will have to . So if you want to sell things as effectively as it should be, you have to spend $10 USD+ just to setup a store that will sell things for you (you set prices), and those can last 1 day to 7 days (getting more expensive for longer, up to $30 USD.)


They come out with new character classes OFTEN! I swear, whenever you start getting your character to a high enough level to be happy with it, they release something that will outclass you in EVERY WAY! and you will essentially be forced to play that newest class since the monsters only get stronger to keep competing with the newest classes. And dont expect your old class to get revamped any time soon! it took them well over 3 years just to update the adventurers ONCE. and over a year for most anything else. In some cases the skillsets even change so completely you wont even recognize what to put your skill points into! but it gets because if you make a mistake you will have to spend the $5+ USD to reset your points and hope you get it right the next time. It used to be that you had to spend about that much to reset a SINGLE POINT! and most skills require 20 or 30, im sure you can see how atrocious that is (the complete reset is only a new addition too, if you wanted reset you had to wait until they revamp your class again, because customer service WILL NOT HELP YOU!

Customer service from Nexon is essentially non-existant, in fact, 99% of any and all messages you will get from them are automated. And no matter how large or small your problem is, nothing will be done. Your account getting hacked, or a broken quest (some havent been fixed for 2+ years), maybe even missing items/progress from a rollback, you will not get any help.

There is no acceptable passive regen's (% or fixed numbers) for being in or out of combat, the only class that had one (the Jett) was removed with their revamp. So of course you must rely on potions ENTIRELY for you healing (unless you are a healer of sorts). The only passive regen you do have is 10hp for standing still for 10 seconds, and at higher levels (something you quickly reach) you have 7,000+ HP easy. while mana regen's at 3, which your mana is easily over 2,000 regardless of class (mages can go up to 30,000).

There are countless more horrible things I can tell you about, but i feel I have made my point, and I beleive this is enough reasons why this game is among the things you should never play. Comments and likes are greatly appreciated! lets get the word out on why this is an awful game!"
MapleStory,Not Recommended,"2,454.2","Posted: July 4, 2022
UPDATING THIS REVIEW ONE MORE TIME: Nexon has officially removed the Jett class from the game because it introduces bugs they don't want to dedicate time towards fixing. Jett is a Global Maplestory exclusive class. There are a few other non-Korean Maplestory classes like Beast Tamer, Hayato, and Kanna which could be removed on a whim at this point. They allowed anyone with a Jett to transfer to a different job in the Explorer branch, but the way the transfer was done was poor and not well thought out. I was personally affected as I had a level 250 Jett I had sunk around 1000 hours into (kind of low for some of the more hardcore players). Honestly after this removal my desire to play the game is basically zero, there's no reason to put time into these unique classes when they could be removed at any time for any reason. The hyper burning and tera burning events aren't enough for me to come back. I'd still recommend playing literally any other game, even Lost Ark.

The ignition update has now launched (11/16/22) and I wanted to add a small tidbit to this review. Nexon has officially removed an item from the game that boosts spawn rates for two hours. You used to be able to buy 15 of these per month by using currency from killing bosses. Without these the game is still perfectly playable but progression will be much slower in comparison. Still cannot recommend this game, and certainly not in light of spawn booster removal.

To be frank, I love this game but can't recommend it to anyone.
It's not even that the game has many problems, to Nexon's credit many client bugs and server issues that used to plague this game are generally fixed and I might crash once a month now. Whereas in the past I would crash once or twice a day while doing dailies.

It's not even that progression is heavily time gated through dailies, or that the game requires an absurd amount of hours and has a near necessity to create dozens of alts to make any real progress on your main.

It's not even that I think the EXP curve is bad post 250, or that the balancing is bad, or that the jump between killing higher level bosses is bad.

It's not even that for the mind numbing weeks of grinding that turn in to months, and then to years you're not even guaranteed to make progress. Blowing up your equipment is the norm here. RNG will be both cruel and benevolent.

I think the main reason I can't recommend this game to anyone is that there are so many better things to do with your time. I'm invested in the game, I'll be playing it until it shuts down. I don't mind that it's going to suck thousands of hours more of my life away before I stop playing.

But if you're dead set on playing this game and you want something mindless with a steady sense of getting something done, this is a good fit. There are so many unique classes in this game it's hard to imagine someone not finding something they'll fall in love with. You've heard it again and again from reviewers but the graphics in this game feel timeless. The music is beautiful, and if you've played in the past the nostalgia is going to hit hard. It's endearing. As of writing this review (7/4/22) the Destiny update has launched and right now might be the best time ever to play this game.

Assuming you're going to play the game in the ""traditional sense"", the gameplay loop will be grinding for an obscene amount of hours to get strong enough to take down a new boss. You'll kill the boss, get the loot if it has any, and start gearing up to kill the next boss. Sounds fast right? Not really. Bosses are weekly and their drops are either RNG or time gated. With some bosses you could go dry for over a year on a drop you might want.

Know what you're signing up for here. At the bare minimum you'll need to train 12 other characters that you may not enjoy playing to gain skills to ""transfer"" to your main. These are fairly significant and you'll need them if you're going to be serious about playing. If you really want to min/max you'll need to play a total of 40 characters, not consistently, but at least each one to a specific level. I enjoyed it, many don't.

Assuming you don't want to spend money, the Reboot server is generally the way to go. This server disables trade between players and has been revamped to allow players to play the entire game without spending money if they really want. Otherwise, playing on any other server be prepared for a long F2P road or to fork over money in the magnitudes of thousands to reach the endgame. Reboot is a time investment. Regular servers are generally a money investment. Both are possible F2P.

If you're on the fence and like what you see in videos and pictures, give it a shot. The real gameplay loop starts at level 200. Look up guides for things you're confused on, the game has a lot of different systems and menus you need to navigate to enjoy it.

Otherwise, don't bother. Find another game."

Maplestory was a great game until the big bang, the massive update which changed allot about the game. It use to take a long time to level, and maps were filled with players. Exploring was fun, diverse and dangerous. Cash shop didn't even exist, okay it did but it was not selling crazy buffs, items or even pets. Back then it was completely optional. This created a fair and fun game. Party quests were awesome and made you play and work together with other players. Each class had a specific task to fufill. I remember how the thief used the dark sight skill to accomplish a goal which only he could do because of the mobs doing crazy damage. This was rad!

Today it's all about spending money. You level 10 times faster and there's no need for exploring. There is seriously a way to fast travel without even having to been there first. Quests are accepted and completed remotely. You rarely meet other players. The party quests still exist (all in one place now, no need to actually go to that specific town or place) but good luck finding a team. It's all empty. You level alone, you play alone, you do your theme dungeons, get to 4th (or 5th? idek) job and just start grinding bosses until you hit level cap and spend money in cash shop so you get the best items with the best stats..

TL;DR: This game is as good as dead, and is mostly p2w. Not recommended. RIP."

Maplestory is a game I have played for 15+ years. The game is much different now than it was on release, as is normal for any game that has been going on as long as Maplestory has. My main issue with Maplestory is the predatory nature of the microtransactions.

Recently Nexon, the publishers of Maplestory, released their rates for their cubes. For those who are unaware, cubes are the way you power up items. They are expensive and difficult to obtain without spending lots of money. Cubes reset the potential stats on items. They have a chance to upgrade the stats to a higher tier, going from Rare - Epic - Unique - Legendary. These stats are where the bulk of your damage comes from.

The rates that were released showed that there was less than a 2% chance of getting an upgrade from Epic to Unique and the rates for Unique to Legendary was less than 0.5%. You can understand how frustrating this can be for someone who has sent thousands of hours in the game (I played years before the steam release). Nexon has a history of providing terrible transparency and customer support to their players.

As fun as this game can be, I do not recommend it. If you are looking for something to kill some time, you will be better off playing almost any other game. Don't let the cute pixel art draw you in."

I first played MapleStory in December 2004. Back in those days, each town was teeming with life! It didn't really matter what you were doing - if you were buying potions, grinding monsters, completing quests, traveling around, or even just sitting still, odds were that at least a few people would cross paths with you. MapleStory did an excellent job at encouraging players to work together with fun and rewarding party quests. My favorite party quests, the monster carnival, pitted two teams of players against each other in a pseudo-PvP mode where you raced against the other party to kill as many monsters as you could before time ran out, and there were plenty of buffs you could get for your own team and debuffs you could cast on your opponent. Some of the greatest memories I have come from those duels. Each class was quite distinct from each other and while there were a few that were less balanced than others in terms of damage output and maneuverability, all were fun to play in their own right. Each server had a vibrant economy, with literally hundreds of players in the ""free-market"" at all hours of the day trying to buy and sell. The cash shop offered stores that you could leave open to sell items for you while you were offline. New content updates added new regions, monsters, and party quests that were always a joy to explore. Unfortunately, around 2010 a controversial update known as ""Big Bang"" was released, which re-organized the world map cutting out a lot of fan-favorite areas (R.I.P. Henesys Hunting Ground) and introduced a new system called Miracle Cubes. Up until this point, the only way to upgrade your gear was by using scrolls, a rare item dropped extremely rarely that would give you the chance to upgrade your gear. A 10% chance scroll would offer a large boost, whereas a 100% scroll would offer a small boost of maybe only a single stat point or two. With miracle cubes, which you have to spend real money on, you are able to re-roll up to three additional slots on your weapons stats. There's not much inherently wrong with this system, but the bonuses offered by these cubes cannot compare to what you could achieve before. Each slot can potentially give a bonus of +12% in a stat. Players that spent money on cubes were in another league than everyone else. This pretty much ruined the balance of the game and split the community down the middle. Not only that, but Nexon continued to disincentivize players from partying up. They implemented an EXP decrease if you were in a party with someone else and reduced the experience gain from party quests. New updates brought free, instant teleportation between continents (more or less) which pretty much meant that you wouldn't meet as many people as you were traveling from town to town. Solo-grinding became the fastest most efficient way to level up, so areas of the game that used to be brimming with life are now literal ghost-towns. MapleStory was once an excellent MMORPG, but now it is just a husk of it's former self. If you're able to find friends to play this game with, it might still be worth playing, but ask anyone, the glory days of this game are far, far, behind us."

(This review is based on the timeframe I spend playing the game from 2006 to early last year)

Maplestory is one of those games that you remember fondly as you watch it burn to the ground. All the old players from the past no longer reflect on the game as being one of the greatest memories of the era, as so many changes happened to the game that caused it to be what it is now.

To start, back in 06, I had started the game based on a friend's recommendation and ended up hitting forth job in 09. Back then, the grinding through levels was real and it took a normal player a few years to reach 3rd-4th job, which felt meaningful and players had pride for the work that they had put so much effort into the game.

Fast forward, and Big Bang, the expansion that was supposed to upgrade the game ended up shifting up a lot of the areas that players had met ingame. What was thought to be an expansion of the main game ended up with a boatload of different jobs and skill changes that overwhelmed the base game, causing upgrades to damage that ended up weakening the bosses that would take hours to kill into very-short session and the game really started to go downhill from there.

What took years to achive forth job ended up changing to getting to third or forth job in the matter of weeks. Playing the game casually, I ended up making it past level 200 without putting any effort as I would have in the past. Most bosses I fight now, save for the super broken chaos bosses, takes under a few minutes to kills. The impact of having a 200+ character is merely meaningless as the game is designed to have you make as many characters as possible instead of putting effort into a solo character that would prove to be the most meaningful to the player.

It may be that simply times are different now, and the expectations for mmo games have changed. However, maplestory changed itself too much from its original state and I simply cannot recommend this game anymore."

Boycott Nexon until they fix the servers and so many underlying issues on GMS. It's a mess, and they don't care about the player base; only their underlying profits.

Nexon America has a habit of ""promising to communicate better"" and then band-aid fixing issues, completely ignoring the community on some issues, server stability being one of many. Usually it's a ""We'll promise to do better, using Pink Bean Bulletin"", when in reality never using it. Some classes have been known to have been bugged to the point you get an automatic 30 day ban (Beast Tamer comes to mind).

To me, one thing that has become more noticeable in recent times than ever, is blatant favoritism towards the Reboot server, a server that has no trading and enhancement items available for meso, as well as some other perks. It's more of a ""solo progression server"" per-se, but usually any compensation or acknowledgement of issues only goes there, when there even is an acknowledgement of issue.

I've been playing MapleStory on and off since 2010, and the amount of ""it'll get better"" I've seen is absolutely horrendous; the communication is so bad to the point that it feels like DICE with Battlefield 2042, a whole different mess. There's realistically no point to play this game in North America/Europe at this point (especially if you're Dutch, given normal servers are essentially Reboot without any perks now). If you seriously want to play this game, other regions manage better, even the considered ""bad"" regions (thinking potentially of Asiasoft and MapleSEA).

All in all, this game is a shell of its former self, caused by a company that's got its head so far up it's own rear that they can't even do proper communication, to the point the CMs are being attacked, meanwhile there isn't much they can do.

Boycott Nexon, boycott MapleStory, any NX sales, or anything. This game needs true time and effort to fix the underlying crashing and stability issues, as well as the absurd amount of bugs that have plagued the game for years now, to the point it's barely playable, and you have to weigh whether the game will crash or not with too much on screen.

x3TheAran59, better known as Steve, made a YouTube video covering some of the things, and there's even a boycott Discord server due to how bad the game has gotten (you can find that easily on Reddit).

To say I'm disappointed in this game is an understatement; I'm absolutely disgusted with how they treat their players as cash cows and not players, and instead can't even find the issues with their servers (to the point they claimed upgrading them made them worse), and so much more.

All in all, MapleStory is a shell of its former self; if you can somehow get past the huge, HUGE issues, it's grindy to the point it's not even enjoyable at late game. The game is in a category of its own, given it's one of the only 2D MMORPGs on the market, but the huge disconnect has caused a huge rift and glaring problem for players, potentially Nexon.

Don't play this game, for god's sake. Play a better game."

In my opinion, this game used to be really good. It's still good, but not as good as it was.

Maplestory has lost something that many older players found extremely valuable, community. While community still exists in the form of guilds, free market, and henehoes, the lack of rewarding party quests and party-training zones encourage most players to walk the path of a solo player; simply put, the game rewards you much more for playing by yourself.

The game is still enjoyable. It allows you to spend your time to work towards achieving a certain goal, whether it be a higher level or new items. If you love grinding, you'll really enjoy this game."

This game should be 18+. Aggressive loot box and monetization of game mechanics to trick people into wanting to spend money in a game with a kid friendly art style and child friendly censorship, do not at a glance, line up with the games target demographic.

Good core gameplay. If you know exactly what you are doing the monetization in the game is quite reasonable excluding loot box systems, you can earn currency to buy monetized things by spending time in game which is always a nice mechanic to see in MMO.

Dailies system has been pushed nearly as far as it can go. Daily mission used to bring people back everyday can take 1-3 hours depending on current events and how much you care about your progression.

Lots of replayability, in fact the game wants you to make 40 characters (a Legion) which will take you between 5-80 hours each depending on your experience and resources on hand. (There area few 2 hour runs but this will not be 99% of players)

Fair amount of diversity in playstyle in the characters so it helps not make it too monotonous and if you abandon a character because you don't like it don't worry you helped make all your other characters stronger in the future your work is not wasted you helped your Legion.

Every month I've been playing this game there has been some scandal with the devs mistreating the community. Looking at community pages this appears to be a trend and they show very little signs of trying to improve. People are often gaslighted for voicing their opinions which may explain the lack of positive response from the developer.

No other game like it in the market."

Oh man has this game died so much.

When I first began playing which was in 2009, the Maplestory community was the best gaming community I had EVER experienced. The social aspect of the game was absolutely amazing. Back then, Factions weren't dead and every day I would find interesting people to play with and party up with. Now, maps are relatively quiet and empty, and you never get the party invites and friendliness that there used to be. People just farm to themselves and the amount of people playing has dropped so much that I feel like I'm playing on empty servers all of the time. People don't even bother talk to you and in the major cities all you find is afk players just sitting there waiting for you to rank up their fame. Gameplay has also changed for the worse too. Back then there were relatively few and DISTINCTIVE classes that were unique and gave the game a balanced and helpful feel. Nowadays there is just a bunch of classes that are very similar and their niches are intertwined so much that you feel like class choice doesn't really give you a new and fun experience anymore. They've also emphasized microtransactions too much that it just takes away from the game. Overall, you feel like you're playing in a largely empty singleplayer game that's not even fun because the social aspect has completely rotted to nonexistence and the large amounts of ""events"" that fail at trying to make the game more interesting. The game has died and I must admit that even if you pay lots of money to level up and look cool, it doesn't matter a single ounce in the end because you've wasted your hard earned captical on a game with a meaningless and dead world and community."

2: keep grinding by killing monsters with the same buttons but with different effects.
3: Even more grinding
4: not even close to the end babyyyy
5: wow u get 1% exp each hour now
Result: you got your character to max lvl? congrats! you wasted like 3 months of your life for no reason.
TBH
If your new to the game, i recommend just look up a guide to farming exp, quests are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ useless. (Most of them at least) and most of the times, you'll find yourself just killing the same monsters over and over again for the next like week.
Why did I give this game a recommended review? Idk, im a no-life scrub, what else can I do?

To this day I hold onto the hope that one day we'll get a Maplestory Classic.

There was something incredible about the slow process of leveling up, getting money the old fashioned way through questing and the social aspects of doing Party Quests together... Hitting Henesys PQ and working your way up to Kerning and Ludibrium etc etc... It was an incredible journey that felt satisfying and memorable.

The game in it's current state today is... different... still fun! don't get me wrong, but it does feel a bit like a hollow shell of it's former self, I'd say from my experience the leveling up process heavily relies on soloing maps and sadly, the game went from ""let's work together"" to "" MOVE CHANNEL PLZ""

I still recommend playing it tho! The game is vibrant and colourful, the soundtrack is probably one of my all time favourites! (honestly, I still often listen to it even whilst playing other games or when doing other stuff! check it out!), and overall there's still LOTS of content to explore and play through!

I'll go back to my original point tho... The game could definitely use a WoW style reboot in the realms of a ""Classic"" style server, or an ""Oldschool Runescape"" type thing...

Whether if it does or doesn't happen one day, I'll never know... But I'll always cherish the good times and the many great memories I've had growing up with this game :)"

ATTENTION EUROPEAN PLAYERS: Avoid playing on European servers at all costs, it's trash. Just play on the NA one, the european server lags like crazy. Especially if you've got strong internet, in that case you won't feel any lag in NA, while there'll always be lag on the european server, as it's the server's problem.

I don't want to beg for ""likes"", but please upvote this review so people can be aware of this.

Thank you in advance :)

Edit: I recently came back to MapleStory and remembered this review, so I should update to let you know that the EU server no longer lags and it's absolutely fine to play in. HOWEVER, be aware that Maple Story has always been many times more popular in the USA than in Europe, so our server is nowhere near a populated as the american one"

Been playing casually for many years and I probably have 1000+ hours. So if you are starting this game in 2022, STAY AWAY!!! It is a fun game, however the time and dedication required to see progress is definitely not sustainable and there are better games/things you can do with your time. I honestly and wholeheartedly believe the developers and management team of Nexon is deliberately trying to destroy this game. Whether it's lack of communication with the player base or even just terrible implementation of new and old content, it is not worth it at all to start playing this game in 2022 -- for both the regular servers (heavily inclined to P2W) and the reboot (F2P) servers. Once again, STAY AWAY."

You can play this game for over 1000 hours and still not be close to end-game. It's fun for a little while (much less time than my personal time indicates), but don't waste a penny on this game. The game is designed so that you will only be able to keep up if you NEVER take a break, or you spend an absurd amount of money. There are multiple important items that are time-limited (e.g. Pets with auto-potion, auto-loot, and auto-buff... let me tell you, you NEED all 3 of these things once you are past level 200, the game is horrendous without them). You can acquire these things from events or from the cash shop, but either way you acquire them will have an expiration date, INCLUDING pets that cost $100. Speaking of the cash shop, you will also never be able to make your character look decent unless you spend money. There are some event reward cosmetics, but they all just look like clown attire.

If you do want to play, play on the Reboot server, make a Hyper Burning character, enjoy the early-to-mid game bosses (Lotus was the last boss I enjoyed fighting, most players will get bored way sooner than this), and then drop the game FOREVER. Or, you know, just play dozens of better games with the time that you would have wasted on this one."

I started playing this game when pirates came out. I used to love this game I really did. What I loved the most out of this game was the sense of being part of a community. The community is still active with an estimated 50,000-70,000 players but will continue to dwindle since less people join the game than there are leaving. I left because I didn't like the direction the game was taking.

I can't say if the game is still worth playing.. All but one server, the Reboot server, are pay to win. If you have the time to do mindless grinding then the Reboot server is for you (keep in mind that you cannot trade anything in this server). Find yourself a guild and hopefully you find some nice people to chat with. I don't recommend joining the non-reboot servers anymore as the majority of the old veterans are one of the most elitist and toxic players out there, and that's coming from the veteran player I am. Pretty much the normal servers are kept alive by the whales who spend tons of money in the game still. Anyone willing to pay can to be on top but I decided to not spend the money myself, it seems pointless and unfun instead of working towards progressing your character yourself.

One of the things I really disliked about this game was the introduction of the potential system. Potential widened the gap between rich and poor players. It divided the community even further. There are a ton of potential related items in the cash shop that give an unfair advantage to players with lots of money to drop in non-Reboot servers. Reboot is just a band-aid for the problem potentials created in this game. Reboot is a server Nexon created that solved many pay to win aspects, however this comes with many drawbacks, including the inability to trade with one another within the server. Another problem I saw was that Nexon was nerfing party related quests and raids, it was encouraging people to go solo instead of partying with other people which is what I loved from this game (as of today you'll rarely see anyone doing party quests, most people are grinding now instead of doing PQs/Boss Runs/Raids to level up). Now that the damage cap has been removed there is little reason to party with others to do stuff if you're decently funded. One other minor problem I saw is that Nexon created tons of servers, there was no reason to create more, the population wasn't even increasing and it further divided the playerbase. They finally merged many of the barren servers into single servers but are still even less populated than the top 3 populated non Reboot servers.

The game gets minor updates monthly with the occasional major update every now and then, so the game is still alive in that aspect. Thanks to Nexon Korea's ongoing support for the game, there's many more things to do than you could do in old MapleStory which is one of the few things this MMO has going.

I cannot recommend this MMO, but if you really want to try it out, go join the Reboot server, it is the most populated server and hopefully you find some nice people to chat with.

TL:DR
The game is extremely pay to win if you're not playing the Reboot server (keep in mind that you cannot trade in this server). I recommend joining the reboot server only if youre willing to try the game out. The game has an average of 50000-70000 players at the moment."

I remember buying this game for my brother a few years back. Didn't think much of it at the time, but I thought it would be a nice gift for him. I remember seeing him playing it from time to time, the message indicating that he'd started playing it popping up on the corner of my screen. There was always a certain small pride in seeing that, because to me it meant that he was enjoying my gift.
Last September he committed suicide.
After everything had more or less settled down from that, I sat down and booted up his computer. All that was on there was Chrome, Steam, Word, and a few games. One of them, of course, was Stardew Valley.
He had played this game to pieces, clocking over 170 hours and owning practically everything the game had to offer. He had used every square inch to its maximum potential, and was making ridiculous amounts of cash. It was only then did I see just how much he loved his present. No other game he played quite captured his affection as much as this one. None of his friends really knew about it, however; it seems like he preferred to keep it to himself. Like it was his own little bit of heaven he could turn to whenever he wanted.

And because of that, I can't help but smile whenever I play this game.

I cannot recommend it enough; every bit of hard work the developer put into this masterpiece shows in every single aspect. The music is catchy and memorable (i'll ofetn find myself humming certain tunes from it), the world feels lived-in and natural, and the gameplay is incredibly laid back and enjoyable. It's hard to stop once I get invested in the game; minutes can easily turn into several hours. And now, with the multiplayer beta, I play for even longer with my friends, each of us dedicated to our desired jobs. Most of all, however, we're all just happy to be together."

Although Stardew Valley has unmistakable similarities to Harvest Moon, it is a masterpiece in it's own right, one that is very dear to my heart after all those years playing with my mum.

Stardew Valley is complex and simple, heartwarming and detailed. It's complicated enough that so many hours later I still haven't completed most of the achievements or befriended most of the townsfolk, but it's simple and easy enough that I play it almost every night on the couch after work.

Concerned Ape has programmed a masterpiece; his story is just as heartwarming as the story he created. I anticipate each new release and I can't wait to see how far he takes this wonderful game. I rarely give games a perfect score, but this certainly deserves a ten out of ten."

Thank you.
I really hope the developers are able to find this review somehow.

We all have difficult times in our lives.

I started playing Stardew Valley in April 2021, which was not an easy moment in my life. Apart from the COVID pandemic, i was struggling with high anxiety/depression, college was online and the pressure, both from the university and myself, never stopped. It was hard. I cried a lot. But somehow i got through this.
I never played this kind of game before, sort of ""Harvest Moon""-like i guess. But i wanted to try something that i could just... Relax. Enjoy. Take a deep breath and calm my mind. Relieve the tension. Chill.

Stardew Valley, for me, was kind of... a life saver.
I'm still playing it (100h and counting) and the game still do what it did in the beginning: it's an incredibly charming and relaxing game, it's fun and it has likable characters, so far it has been an experience that i am very happy i gave it a shot.
It's one of my favorite indie games ever now. Right beside Bastion, Hollow Knight and Shovel Knight, other favorites of mine.

Stardew Valley calmed me when i needed most. And i will not forget that.

There isn't much to be said that hasn't already been said for this amazing game if you enjoyed the classic harvest moon type games you will absolutely 100% enjoy this. The game play seems fresh and fun even after clocking in over 60 hours, You won't want to quit, “Just 1 more day” then you realize that turned into 5 days and it's 4am and you have to sleep sometime.

This game, takes the old harvest moon concepts and tosses in a bit of Rune factory and a sprinkle of animal crossing leaving you with a sensational experience. Each day brings something fresh, There is over 25 different Npc's to interact with each day and each one brings their own charm and dialogue options depending on if you take the time to build up your friendships.

Your farm can be whatever you make it, You design what it looks like, how it runs, what you plant and what animals you choose to raise. The fishing can be a bit difficult to begin with but very rewarding and relaxing once you get the hang of it. On days you want something a bit different you can hop into the mine and find some rare gems, ores and minerals, Some that you can donate to the game's huge museum or use to upgrade your tools!

I can't praise this game enough, if your on the fence about purchasing this game or you think you should wait for a sale, Don't wait! This game was made by a single developer who deserves every single penny for all the obvious hard work and dedication. So go and farm your butt off!!!!"

If you're looking for a wholesome game that destroys your IRL health bar, look no further. The regularly satisfying hits of dopamine will cause addiction. You'll lose sleep due to the ""Just one more day"" factor. You'll strain your eyes. Your most visited website will change. The existential crisis that will awaken in you for enjoying a pixelated, 2-D world more than your reality will send you down a path of reflection and, in most cases, enlightenment. Probably."

This is a game that I have been looking forward to for at least 2 and a half years. I have wanted to have a game on the PC that had the elements of harvest moon (for the little bit I played of it), Animal crossing (<3) and Rune factory. I was super excited when I was approached by Leth (publishing manager at Chucklefish) at the beginning of December to help him and ConcernedApe (developer of the game) with bug testing and QA. 400+ hours later (off steam and on steam), I still love the game.

Farming. The farming is fantastic. It is to me one of the main elements of the game, and it's just a joy. Being able to design your farm any way you want it... yes please. Planning out what to buy every season, where to plant them, on top of the thrill of when you can harvest and reap on the gold... it's so enjoyable and addictive.

Fishing. The fishing is outstanding. From playing WoW and Runescape.. or any game with fishing, the fishing in Stardew Valley is so much fun. At first, the fishing is challenging, but as you progress your skill, you become a pro in no time.

Mining and combat. Mining and combat is incredible. Going deeper into the mines can be tough, but if you're prepared with your food and weapon in hand, you can fend off the creatures and get your sweet ore/minerals/gems that you want to bring back to your house and possibly hoard. (Hi, I'm Bexy, and i'm a hoarder.)

Social. Social interactions are great. Being able to become friends with the people in the town, and eventually being able to get into relationships with people and having a family with them.. what's not to like about that? And what's great is that it gives great replayability because you can have different saves with different spouses! The backstory for each of the characters too is so in depth and well thought out, you will be silly if you don't shed a tear maybe once or twice.

The actual main story is well rewarding, and once you ""complete"" it, you can still continue on your adventures and farming life with no problems, hell you might even discover new things afterwards, I sure as hell did!

Yes, I was a tester for the game. Yes, I have played for ridiculous amounts of hours. It may feel like i'm being a bit overzealous with this. However you have to remember, I was a tester. I tested the crap out of every aspect with this game, even though there were massive game breaking bugs, errors, glitches, crashes. I still love this game. I reported many a bug, and ConcernedApe was quick to fix them.

And that's the thing, not only is the game amazing, the developer is too. ConcernedApe works around the clock to make sure that bugs are fixed in quick time in order for us to have an amazing experience with this game. And that's true. The experience that you have with this game IS amazing.

Minutes playing turn into hours. Hours turn into ""oh no it's time to sleep"".
You will forget about time. You will forget about sleep. You will forget that dinner was about 5 hours ago but you couldn't' remember because you were too busy trying to fight off 12 bats that were clobbering you inside the mines while trying to gather that 1 diamond waaaaay in the back.

So yes, I without a shadow of a doubt 150% recommend this game to anyone that wants to ""escape"" for days on end with what I am classifying as my #1 Game of 2016."

If you look at the playtime above this review, you might be thinking to yourself... ""How on earth does one person invest 400 hours of their life into a game about farming?"" Well, it's a lot easier than you think.

Stardew Valley opens with our disillusioned protagonist slaving away at a corporate job, only to be reminded of a promise that they had made with their grandfather so many years ago. A promise of something to brighten the shadows when life becomes too dreary for them. Our stalwart protagonist waves goodbye to the grey walls of their office to board a train to Stardew Valley, an unknown paradise far away from the city. And it is here, where their life truly begins.

I can only wish that we all find our Stardew Valley someday. Yee-haw."

I convinced my brother to help me buy our mom a PS4 last Christmas so she could play Stardew Valley. She was playing the same Animal Crossing game on Wii for years, so getting her to try something new was risky.

After my brother showed her the TV apps, mom humored me and let me teach her how to play. She made a farm, and sort of caught on to using tools.

It’s August now. She’s logged over 500 hours into that farm. Her cellar is packed with kegs, the seashore is red with crab pots. She wields a flashy Return Scepter that I’ve never even gotten.

INTRODUCTION

Stardew Valley.

I've heard a lot of things about this game. A lot of extremely positive things.

And I was doubtful. Was Stardew Valley really that good? I was afraid that people were just giving it attention because they didn't actually know what a good game was. And as insulting as it may sound, in my defense, uhhm....

Before buying the game I hadn't really seen what it looked like, or knew what it was about. I just knew that it was published by the same company, Chucklefish, that had developed Starbound. I had loved Starbound.. So I was playing completely spoiler free. Haven't watched any videos, no tips & tricks, just the information of a billion recommended reviews stuffed into my head.

So I bought Stardew Valley, and had pretty high expectations. If a game received THAT much popularity, it should be seriously good, right?



Plop. Into the world of Stardew Valley.

You completely start from the bottom, trailing after a tragedy and responsibility that's struck. A farm, barely any money, and the mystery of a town left in your hands. Whew. That's really a lot when you think about it.


Boy, did I NOT know what I was getting myself into.


At first, I was mesmorized. Or maybe lost is a better word. The beginning's all new and immersive, and the middle... kind of leaves you stuck. But, this is because I was impatient with the game. I went in wanting to finish it asap. However, I realized this game is NOT simply for you to buy and finish. It's something else... entirely.

The thing with Stardew Valley, It's all about exploration and management. Discovering and figuring out secrets and a beautiful story was amazing. Creative mechanics and powerful creativity had combined to produce a fabulous well-formed game that leaves a sweet taste in your mouth, and I'm going to tell you right now... it's totally addicting.

I bought the game a few days ago, and literally have played it all day since. I've NEVER done that with a game before. I found myself as a kid in a candy shop, gaping at all the different flavors, and being able to savor them all. And now, in Year 3 of the game.. I still have a lot more to discover.



Compared to others, I've only played around 130 hours of the game thus far. Buy Stardew Valley. You really won't regret it. This game is beautiful. The music is whimsically lifting, and the soundtrack is wonderful. It's a work of art. You will find yourself falling in love with the characters, and the daily routine of being a farmer who restores the life around people, and who changes everyone for the better. It's so relaxing, so addicting, and so much fun. I have played games for years, played games with far more hours than I have with Stardew Valley- and yet, I always turn to Stardew Valley first. Why? It's amazing. It offers something to everyone.

The game rewards for the hard-working. Stardew Valley is a game where you really have to manage things, yet, it allows you to explore the whole art of it. Work hard as you play the game, and there are sweet rewards. And I'm talking about rewards sweeter than all the candy in that candy shop.

Here's the thing: you can take two routes with Stardew Valley. You can either take the money route and become rich and miss half the game, or you can immerse yourself in exploring the town and what the game has to offer, but with also missing the point that Stardew is a management farming game.

Or, you can successfully find the balance between both. But how?

Stardew Valley allows you to store multiple accounts, which is fantastic. I recommend exploring with your first account, and learning the ropes. You seriously won't know anything yet, and will be like ""OMFG"" when you figure out there's a way that makes things one hundred times easier. After that, create a second account, and start figuring out farm management and what the game has to offer. This is a game in which you learn from your mistakes.

And now... I'm left in a spot where I can successfully thrive, and only continue to grow.



- Enchanting music that sings as you play

- A simple yet fun art design that you can't help but fall in love with

- Characters whom capture your heart

- A shambled town that begins to thrive

- Hidden secrets that you can't help but want to keep discovering

- Amazing challenges that leave you wanting more

- Brilliant originality, which is incredibly difficult to find

- A storyline that changes your perspective beautifully

- Lots of fun, and I mean .

- Mods created by the community to make your game more fun and immersive- however, I play without mods.

- IT FINALLY HAS MULTIPLAYER!



- As I said, the game rewards you for hard work. But only for hard work. It can be a grueling process, but it is extremely profitable. Those who don't like putting effort into a game won't enjoy Stardew Valley as much as other games.

- Time. Stardew Valley takes a lot of time to play through. It's a game you thoroughly have to enjoy and adventure out on.

- Repetitive. The game can be grueling. To reach certain goals you have to go through processes that you will SERIOUSLY hate. But, in the end, it's definitely worth the labor.




- I wish there would be more characters. Once you go through the storyline with everyone, there's not much lore left.

- More secrets and new areas, of course!



Stardew Valley offers a lot of things, and has changed the lives of many people. Perhaps in peace, wonder, open-mindedness, the game gives a lot. But I have one thing that's been bothering me for a long time... How in the damn world did one single person spit out a freaking awesome game?

Even though it's a farming game, which is commonly found everywhere, it's original with its own spins. It's extremely difficult to find a game that has such a captivating message that's been developed so well. Stardew Valley is a lot of fun and awe, and it really draws a blank in your mind.

Buy Stardew Valley. At first, it might seem mediocre... but keep playing. Trust me, the candies are still sweet. And they really only get sweeter."

Spoiler free review, with a short and a longer version:

Buy this game if:

+ You're interested in farming, even though you're allowed to make that it isn't 100% of the core gameplay;
+ You were looking for a long, yet various and easy to be resumed game;
+ You're fond of pixelated indie games;
+ You can bear resource hunting and you have some patience, as there are some RPG and crafting gameplay;
+ You love games that are supported by modders and regularly updayed by the developer himself (Update 1.5 - see longer review part down below)

Don't buy the game if those above points aren't significant for you;






Longer version:
Let's see now the most important points, including the DLC, described in the 6th bullet point:

1-
Your grandpa, who lived the last part of his life is Stardew Valley has passed away and you as his nephew/niece have inherited a plot of land in Stardew Valley itself. Bored and saddened by the repetitive and dull life that you're spending working in a big firm (feel free to imagine it as Amazon/Nestlè)... you decide to accept the inheritance and embark in this new life and adventure.

2-
Even though clearing debris, pruning weeds, killing evil monsters and cutting trees is fun and necessary up to a certain point, you're not ""forced"" to keep farming 24/7, as the game is full of side activities who can be remunerative and of course fun, such as:
- tending to animals;
- mining;
- foraging;
- fishing:
- more...

3-
this means that besides customizing your own home, buildings and clothes there is a skill system, which can shape and improve the way on how you've decided to play the game;

4-
The NPCs are actually interesting and they're worth your time, socializing with them, helping them and confronting them on events, quests is always a good distraction and worth your time, as they'll be quite rewarding in terms of money, items and story progression in general, even though you're not forced to follow any particular path. Your actions have consequences that will also change the landscape and the city.

5-
I personally recommend Stardew Valley Expanded as a mod to be installed, feel free to check it on Nexusmods

6-
my biggest gripe with SV this free massive update from December 2020 was that there wasn't enough end-gameplay elements or goals to be reached. This update addressed completely these issues by adding a new whole area, distant from Stardew Valley, by adding new minerals, animals, crops, quests, weekly quests, npcs and much more, including many quality of life changes, which make the gameplay much smoother and fluid.

I spent three years building up hype, and I was still blown away.

If you enjoyed Harvest Moon, Rune Factory or Animal Crossing - then get this. It captures all the same things that made those games great, and it's the perfect game to play either casually or seriously. There are so many different ways to earn money and they're all developed and fun, the hardest part is choosing which one to spend your time doing.

The progression curve in the game is fantastic too. Every day you'll feel like you're making progress but there's still always something to work towards and you won't 'beat it' after a couple of hours earning as much money as possible, as there's always something to spend your money on. Even after 20 hours of playing, I feel like I'm nowhere near the endgame, and I could easily see myself playing through again and doing things differently. I'm even doing a playthrough on YouTube and the progress feels dramatically different even in its early stages.

I'm easily disappointed by games, so you can imagine my surprise when I was so impressed by a game made by one person. Congratulations, ConcernedApe, you've made one of the best games I've ever played."

Overview

Stardew Valley is a game that borrows heavily from similar titles in the Harvest Moon series. You start out in a rural town with nothing but a dilapidated house and crop fields that are more akin to the wilderness than a place to grow vegetables. The game is simple in its understanding: build a farm, make profits, live your life. What the game allows you to do makes it so much more layered. You're left with the freedom to explore the town, its residence, mold your farm into whatever you want it to be and on your own time. Sure, there are events to attend, festivals to see, men/women to romance and marry, kids to have, buildings to construct, fish to catch and weird little slimes to slay (Dragon Warrior, anyone?), but how and when you do those things is up to you.

In essence, the game offers you very similar things to do as a Harvest Moon game does: Build and upgrade your farm, plant crops, upgrade tools, mine in the never-ending dungeon for precious ore, go fishing, romance and get married...etc. While some of your old favorites are back, new aspects have been introduced as well, but I won't spoil those in this review. Let's just say there's a nice story that evolves over time.

The freedom to do as you please is what makes this game, and Harvest Moon in general, so enjoyable. It's a chance to mellow out, play at your own pace and still enjoy everything the game has to offer. What Stardew Valley does, it does right. It's charming, cute and feels rewarding, even when all you're doing is cuttings weeds. It doesn't pull any punches or try to be something its not; the developer had a goal in mind and Stardew Valley is a reflection of just that. You can feel the effort, the time and the devotion that went into this game over the years. Stardew Valley is a gem and worth looking at. If you loved Harvest Moon, you'll love Stardew Valley.

To date, Stardew Valley is a single player game, though the developer as mentioned some form of co-op or multiplayer availability in the future.











Overall, Stardew Valley is a pleasure. I haven't put a ton of time into it (yet), but I easily see that happening. It's fun, lighthearted and addictive. As I said earlier in this review, if you've ever played Harvest Moon, you'll enjoy Stardew Valley. It's worth checking out and I highly recommend it. This will easily become one of my most played games on my list. You won't be disappointed, so check it out!"

It's winter, you have a weekend and you don't need to go anywhere. It's so peacefully quiet outside. You brewed yourself hot tea along with fragrant pastries. You make yourself comfortable by the warm fireplace wrapped in a blanket and play Stardew Valley. Your farm is wonderful. You are the happiest person."

I was never interested in farming games. I’ve never played a Harvest Moon game or an Animal Crossing game, and never had any interest in them. The closest thing to a farming game I’ve ever played was Minecraft. I definitely would have never tried Stardew Valley if I wasn’t an achievement hunter and it didn’t have achievements.

But now I see what all the hype was about.

Stardew Valley is a game that is very easy to lose oneself into. There are many elements of the game that feel intimately relatable to real life, especially the game’s premise: you’re stuck at a soul-crushing corporate office job when your grandfather dies, leaving you an envelope telling you to open it only when you’ve reached your absolute limit and need something new. After a particularly bad day at work, you finally decide to open the envelope and find a deed to your grandfather’s farm on a far-off island, so you take the plunge and decide to move there. It is a very strong analogy to the game itself, where you, the player, are seeking escapism from your daily life and decide to take the plunge into this game, not knowing what else to expect.

In Stardew Valley, you will find your new home upon a sizable but absolutely trashed plot of land. As the days go by, you can clean up the land and discover hundreds of ways to make a profit with what you’ve been given, from buying seeds and planting crops, to raising animals, to fishing (by means of a surprisingly pleasant and addictive quicktime event), to foraging for wild food, and even to exploring a few combat-centric Zelda-style dungeons. But you’re not making money for its own sake – there are dozens of mysterious secrets scattered about the land, each with significant and game-changing rewards at the end, and you need to raise the money and resources to investigate them all. The game experience is going to be totally different for everybody depending on what game elements you are inspired to pursue first. Although you’ll assuredly be looking at a wiki in due time, it is deeply satisfying to go in blind and piece things together yourself for as long as you can.

Years consist of four months, each month being 28-day season. Some gameplay mechanics change with the seasons, particularly that certain crops only grow in certain seasons, and (almost) no crops grow in winter, so you’ll have to carefully consider what seeds to plant and when. Each day lasts about five minutes, and you’ve got to make sure you’re back in your house by 2AM, or else you’ll pass out and lose some money. The biggest way the game hooks you is the fact that your progress is only saved at the of a day – so if you’re eager to wake up in the morning and harvest your crops, it won’t mean anything unless you play the whole day through. A vicious cycle! I clocked 120 hours of this game in the first 2 weeks of playing. That’s how bad it is.

Another one of the game’s strengths is the cozy little community you live beside, with a population of about 25 people. The game does a wonderful job of making each character feel like their own entity, with their own daily routines and backstories and motivations. You’ll really get to know and love them. You can give gifts to characters to increase friendship level with them, unlocking character development cutscenes and important rewards. You can even date some of them (you can have 6 boyfriends and 6 girlfriends at once if you want, no joke; relationships are gender-indiscriminate) and then marry the character of your choice. The social aspect is sometimes a bit too real – you’ll feel the pain of rejection all too often – but that makes the successful relationships all the more heartwarming.

As for complaints: surprisingly, the game has some strange and baffling bugs, most of which are visual (like ice-skating horses), but some which affect gameplay, and a few known save-corruption bugs. I also felt consistently uncomfortable with the controls. If you're using the mouse, your cursor needs to always be in proximity of your character, or else you'll only aim at the tile in front of you, making it very easy to abruptly turn the wrong direction while working. And if you accidentally click the wrong tile, your character will turn to face it, changing the default direction you aim, compounding the problem. It can be infuriating, especially if it causes you to accidentally destroy crops. Also, I don't like how you can only talk to NPCs if you have a tool selected, and how you'll use a consumable item at the same time as opening a door if you have one selected. The controls could definitely use some additional polish.

Then there are the inventory controls. If you click on an inventory item, you pick it up and you can drop it in a different inventory slot. If you click on an inventory item with a storage box open, you will immediately transfer the item into (or out of) the box. Thus, it is impossible to organize the inventory with a storage box open. If you click on an inventory item while in a shop, . I can't tell you the amount of times I purchased 200 seeds, then immediately sold them again just because I tried to pick them up and put them in a different slot.

Also, I can’t help but feel the game should have even more content than it already does – perhaps more dungeons, a bigger map, and the ability to run more than one farm. But (as of this writing) the game is still in active development, including a co-op multiplayer patch in the works, and a lively modding community.

I give this game an 8/10. A wonderful example of what all those crappy Farmville mobile games would be like if they were actually balanced around gameplay and not milking the player with microtansactions and daily login bonuses. Despite some stupidly distracting bugs and annoying controls, it’s some simply wonderful escapism, and made me finally see the appeal in a farming game. It does get stale in time, but not before offering a huge amount of joy. For achievement hunting, it’ll easily take about 200 hours, especially blind… but if you’re like me, you’ll have it over with in a month or two. A huge thumbs-up."

Originally, when I was younger and inconsiderate, I pirated this game and sunk in at least 100 hours. Once I had my own money, I bought this game on Steam when the multiplayer update came out. I played a lot with my girlfriend at the time, and when we broke up, I stopped playing for a while and deleted the save. A few months later I was in a low place, so I bought this game on Switch and completed the story and got married, and had kids (so I sunk in a fair amount of hours ~200) It was the only thing motivating me to look after myself as I wanted to keep playing. As I recovered from that dark part of my life, I played less and less until a friend mentioned they wanted to play with me. So now I've been chilling on a farm with my friend through lockdown. This game as a whole has helped me through a lot, and has given me a bunch of great memories. I recommend Stardew Valley to anyone that likes Harvest Moon, farming sims in general, or just having a great time. The music is stellar and the art style is nice and fits with the game. Generally a great experience!!"

Stardew Valley is literally the first game that I bought in seconds, with the full price, without thinking. I was a Harvest Moon lover, I really, really wanted to have a PC game like HM, and Oh my.
ConcernedApe, you sir, are one of the most amazing developers, both in terms of actual developing, and keeping up with the date as well. There are a lot of games out there that were abondened by their devs, but our supreme leader listens. Makes it happen. And I am oh so greatful.
The story, the characters, the customization, mods that you can get, amount of things you can do in this games is just amazing, also, it is, IT REALLY IS, Beautiful~ You can see in the wiki, how the NPC development went, you can feel the time this game was given by this person, and he deserves every single penny and every single praise for it.

Do you see this play time??? And I still haven't 100 percented this thing. There is so much content here, and you get it all with one purchase! No DLC! Nothin'! Concerned Ape, do you have some aversion to money!?

All joking aside, this is a fantastic game. Hundreds of hours of content in this little pixel art game about farming and bringing a dying town back to life. The most recent update just added a bunch of new late game content (which was the only gripe I had with this game up until this point) You can play this for years and not run out of stuff to do (and I have)

I grew up playing Harvest Moon on the SNES. My parents probably rented the game a dozen+ times before putting up the money to just buy the damn game. My brother and I dumped hours, and hours, and hours into that game. Beating it multiple times to see some of the different endings.


A few years ago, for the first time, a game was released that bested the original Harvest Moon. That game is obviously Fortnite. JK


Stardew Valley is such a good spiritual successor, that it beats the original hand over fist. It's entirely it's own game, while nodding its head to what I assume is its source inspiration. It exceeded my expectations by a lot, and it continues to be improved on again and again.


This game has a lot of replayability (just ask my wife who has nearly 1000 hours logged by now). Between different relationships, different focuses, different game altering choices, and different property layouts and designs. There's enough content to keep you entertained and coming back for a very long time.


It might seem minor, but the games soundtrack is probably one of the best, if not THE best out there. Chrono Cross was my former favorite, but only Stardew Valley has led to me purchasing the soundtrack on digital and two different vinyl releases (okay, one of those was a gift). It keeps the game from getting as monotonous as it MIGHT otherwise get sometimes. Its similar to the Tetris song. After enough playing, the music is ingrained in my soul. Lmao


Gorgeous pixel graphics. Amazing variety and loads of charm. The creator clearly has a deep passion for this game and it shows in nearly every way.


This game deserves so much more money and appreciation than it gets.


11/10 - stop ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ around and buy the game already. I dont care if you find farming boring.

PS - shout out to my brother. He never got to experience this masterpiece, but at least we had good times on Harvest Moon. He would have loved it. RIP 1987-2007"

This game is dangerous.

When I first started playing I was like, ""It's cool, farming is fun but I don't really see the hype around it.""

Then I kept playing.

It's gotten so bad that I have 10 tabs open just to look up stuff on the wiki for this game. I open the game and blink and two hours have passed, and while I feel sad that I just lost so much time, I look at the progress I made on my farm and think, ""Worth.""

This is one of the most fun games I've ever played.

It's designed in such a way that it allows both casual players and competitive / optimization-oriented players to have a blast with this game. There is so much to do in this game, and there's so much to offer. You can spend your days farming, fishing, mining, foraging, talking to the villagers, etc. The game is made in a way in which you don't have to hyper-optimize every little detail like min-maxing profit, time management, etc, because there's no time limit for things (unless you count seasons, but there's always another year) and there's no stakes. But if you want to, you definitely can.

Talking to the villagers is fun as well, they're well-designed, and you can even find patterns in their daily schedules. There's a lot of details in this game.

I haven't tried the multiplayer, but from what I've seen it can definitely be a lot more fun with friends. But playing solo is extremely fun as well.

My only gripe with the game is that it's a huge time sink. I waited until my semester was over to get into it because I heard about the time sink beforehand, and I was glad I waited, because all I can think about now is, ""What crops am I going to plant next season? Where I should place them? How much money am I making from these? Should I fish or mine? Did I feed my animals today? DID I TALK TO ROBIN TODAY?""

And of course, Robin is best girl, no discussion there."

There are plenty of games out there that might give you a higher high. Getting the highest score in a lobby of some FPS for example.

This game is nothing short of straight BEAUTY. I have never played a farming sim before this, and honestly I thought I wouldn't like it because it was so different from the games I usually played at the time (FPS). As soon as I cracked it open, I felt the joy of 100 perfect headshots of a PvP match light up my cerebral cortex as my brain was melted by the gracious and time-taking beauty of Stardew Valley. The amazing 16-bit design of the character portraits, freshly tilled ground, and don't get me started on the fishing. Without any guides, I made 15,000 Gold before Winter, and even with watching guides, you never feel like you're cheating yourself, because there's just so much joy to it that it is impossible to ruin the game with watching videos about (spoiler) and (spoiler). I was amazed to learn that this was created by ONE GUY, Mr. Eric Barone. May whatever God he believe in bless his soul, as he has blessed mine with this amazing game.

As you can see from my hours played I adore this game.

Whenever I search for a new game I go to the reviews and I make sure that the majority of the reviewers have played for more than 100 hours. Amount of hours played gives a game credibility in my opinion.

I have played and played and played Stardew Valley in many ways.

I have tried all of the maps, explored every inch, and grew to know every character.

Tonight my hubby and I are delving into the multiplayer beta and I still feel thrilled as if it was my first time playing.

The music is relaxing, the atmosphere is enjoyable, really everything about this game is made for one such as me.
I have a four year old and at night after bedtime I hop on my computer to calm down after the day. I nearly always go for Stardew Valley to really destress. (Though recently I have been attached to My Time at Portia lol), but still I come back to Stardew.

Every new time I play I try to knock out another steam challenge or two.

I try to woo new characters.

I try to keep it fresh.

And, thus far I still love this game as much as I did the first time I opened it."

By admission of the dev himself, this game is Harvest Moon at its core. A formula that is purely addictive and satisfying as hell.

But there is something Stardew Valley has over Harvest Moon, and that's a heart. The intro to the game is incredibly human and relatable. I sympathized with my character right off the bat. I think we all know how it feels to want to escape the mundane grind, and in a funny kind of way, this game does that.

A moment I felt that the game truly had a soul was when I was walking to the mines on a rainy day, when suddenly I was greeted by a cutscene of coming upon Abigail, my romance interest, playing a flute next to the lake. It's a very quiet scene, with nothing but the sound of rain and her flute playing. After some dialog, my character (who is a silent protagonist by the way) pulls out a mini harp and joins Abby in a duet, something that really surprised me as there was no indication that my character had any musical talent prior to this scene. It was a bonding experience, and it felt incredibly real, memorable, and touching. I'll always remember it.

And when you realize that there are TEN love interests in this game with different scenes like this for each of them, man, that's an intimidating amount of content.

Maybe I shouldn't be saying that Harvest Moon doesn't have any heart at all, but when it comes down to it, this is the game that I'm going to remember more fondly in the end. I made memories with Harvest Moon as a child. Now I'm making memories with Stardew Valley as an adult. You should too. The game is worth full price and then some."

It's a cute and relaxing game but it was surprisingly short. I feel like it ended abruptly.

Would be worth waiting and buying it on sale(more than 50% off) because it's pretty expensive imo for the amount of playtime you get.

I have 4.3 hours on here but I did go through a second time for achievements, so it's even shorter than that.

Apparently there's no intention of adding anymore to the game too which just pushes the fact that you should wait until a decent amount of money is off the game before you purchase it."

Great game but I wish there was a free-play mode with randomized rooms to unpack. As-is, the game feels a bit lacking in content. The story is cute and fun, but when I was through with it, I just felt disappointed, like there should have been more.

I'd say this game was worth the price if finishing the story unlocked some other game play modes or something, but it just... ends. And the replay value isn't very high. Once the story is done, that's just kinda it. No reason to leave it on your device, just uninstall and download something else.

Hopefully the devs add something more to this because the gameplay itself is great.

I'd only recommend getting it on a decent sale at this point because it's a very short a one-and-done right now."

Definitely a relaxing game, however 20$+ for barely 2-3 hours of gameplay is very overpriced. I wish there was more to it, especially since among the very few levels, some only have a room or two.

I'd love to see more levels in the future, or even unpack for a whole new family. Basically, this game needs more content before it's worth the price."

The game took less than 3 hours to complete. I've been following the game for years so it's a little disappointing to be finished all the content in one little sitting.

Otherwise a great game. Very relaxing. Wonderful music.

I really hope that the game will be expanded."

The biggest negative to this game: far too short.
Unpacking is relaxing and fun, and tells a sweet story - nothing wild or huge, just the path of one person's life as they move. I enjoyed seeing what objects carried over through the years and what items got left behind or replaced. It was heartwarming to see how the person grew and what she achieved by looking through her things. I was a little disappointed that there was only this one story, however. Around 7 places to unpack, of varying lengths/difficulties, and then the game is over.

I received this game as a gift, but i do think $20 is a high price point for the 4 hours of game play. If the story struck a huge note with me or if there were different difficulties or things i could improve for replay, i might change my tune, but as it stands, after 4 hours i have seen what there is to see in this game. I would love if there were more levels, maybe based around a different person, or even if steam workshop could make custom levels or items so that players could create their own stories.

TL;DR : fun game, i recommend buying on sale."

The music, the story, and the graphics are pretty nice.
Big minus, not enough content for this price - after a few hours you will be done.

Introduction:
Unpacking is a casual, very cosy little game that has you placing items about your in-game house. To describe it, it is actually very hard to make it sound interesting, and yet it is. I played the entire game in one sitting and wished there was more at the end. It’s a small gem – very cute, very casual, and very relaxing.


X Steep price for playtime. About 4 hours, for $15/£15. I’d wait for a sale.
X Short.
X Not particularly replayable.


+ Cute graphical style.
+ Achievements that are easy to get.
+ Nice background story.
+ Relaxing.
+ Easy to play.
+ Doesn’t require powerful hardware.

Unpacking has a very cute graphical style that is hard to place. Everything is made of pixels (I know that’s true literally but… you know what I mean). It is soft on the eyes, with a gentle colour palette and interesting environments. Rooms are probably tidier than anyone’s actually is in real life, but I soon saw to that.

I really enjoyed the visual style of this game. I think, like so much else about it, ‘cosy’ is an apt description. The only small flaw I could mention is that on some rare occasions, I couldn’t tell what an item was, and because everything is designed in ‘pixels’, zooming in didn’t help. This is not a massive issue though, I worked out what the items were in the end anyway. I only went around all of the rooms waiting for the game to accept a location placement for them…

The game works as if items are placed on an invisible grid of sorts. It is not restrictive at all, and so not a downside, but movement and placement of items isn’t completely ‘free’. They have to snap to positions on surfaces. Some of these items can only go on certain surfaces and the game will alert you to this after you have unpacked everything, but in the main you are free to place anything where you like, and so you are free to approach the gameplay as you like. Some will make everything neat, and take their time about it, while others only care about keeping the bed clear so they can go to sleep that night, even if you would have to be a contortionist to get through all the rubbish on the floor to get there.

As you progress in the game, your living spaces get bigger and so you no longer unpack in just one room. It expands to a whole house. You can cycle through scenes with buttons on the far sides of the screen, but there’s also a floor plan you can pull up from a button at the top that shows you all the rooms on that floor. If it’s a big house, it’s easier to do that, and I appreciate they added this feature.

The gameplay is relaxing, and though the process of unpacking is repetitive in as far as clicking and dragging items across a screen, it is made engaging both by the variety of items, the changing locations, and the background story. Some objects can be interacted with too, often triggering achievements. This adds a nice layer of intrigue beyond just making rooms look tidy. Unpacking never felt boring to play.

Unpacking is actually quite good at environmental storytelling. More than being just a game where you unpack boxes, if you pay attention to the items that you unpack and the varying houses you do it in, you slowly observe a story unfolding. It is surprising how real the story felt, too, despite the lack of dialogue or characters in the game. Each room you unpack becomes a snapshot in time of a person’s life, and as the game plays on you start to get a feeling for this person’s highs and lows as you can observe the behind the scenes of their story. This was an unexpected but very rich addition to the game, I felt.

The music in the game is quite retro, I think. Some of the tracks are quite acoustic and have a light-hearted, summery ethos about them, while others are a little more upbeat. If you have ever played visual novels, certainly those with a romantic plot, the music reminded me a bit of that. I really enjoyed the soundtrack to this game, it set the cosy atmosphere off well.

Some items in game make noises, such as the microwave, when you interact with them. Placing things on surfaces and opening cupboards and similar such actions triggers sound effects too. On the whole, they’re quite minimal, but it really did have me feeling like I was at home alone on a summer afternoon, joyfully unpacking and settling into my new house. It was a lot more stress-free than the real thing…

For those that enjoy unpacking, but who have nowhere to go, this is the perfect game for you. It removes the discomfort of jetlag, the terror of finding spiders have set up a hotel in your house while you’ve been away, and the annoyance of having mess all over the floors for days on end, and instead substitutes it with all the best there is in unpacking – a small window of time where you can let your mind wonder and happily place your belongings aesthetically around your home.

Unpacking is a simple game that is fairly short. The price is a little steep and there’s not much replay value, but it still manages to have a strong sense of atmosphere tell a nice story while offering relaxing and fun gameplay. I would wait for a sale to make it better value, but otherwise I highly recommend this game.

A lovely game made by lovely people. The game play is relaxing, the music is great, and the art style is adorable.
There is however, one very large problem with the game. Its length.
I grapple with this issue a lot in gaming, artist should be able to charge what they see fit for their work and good art, even if small, should be worth it. But, the reality of it is that $20 can go much father and get you much much more on this platform, even from indie devs. The team can and should charge what they want, but after I realized after 3 hours I'd seen all there was to see, I can't lie, I was a bit let down. If there was more free content planned on the way I would be more understanding, but after some digging on the community page, the devs have flat out said that there isn't.

Long and short of it is, they should be able to charge what they want, but the shortness of the game, in MY opinion, paired with its price seems a bit unreasonable. Outside of that it is still a good game.
However, Games that have more to do and are cheaper on steam, by similar sized to even smaller teams are aplenty.
Grab this one on sale or if they lower the price. Or pay up. It's up to you."

the game itself is great, easy to learn mechanics, cute graphics, very relaxing and simple, decent soundtrack and nice plot (though it's barely apart of the game) but it really doesn't have much replay value (and it's only around 3 hours) yet it still costs 22$. if you wanna try the game, get it when it goes on sale"
unpacking,Recommended,3.4,"Posted: November 5, 2021
Harder to recommend but I do
The graphics are beautiful and the sound design and music aren't bad either.
I had a good time playing but as many others have pointed out it's quite short for the price with little to no replay value. Perhaps more game modes (like room design, competitive score based modes, an infinite or sandbox mode where you just unpack as much as you can into a set space, even just some extra levels, etc.) would lend it more longevity.

Having finished it I'm still not sure what some of the items were and it can be potentially irritating trying to figure out where things need to go at the end of a level when you don't know what they are so some item names/descriptions would be a handy addition if you hover over the item or once you've picked it up.

If you're looking for a zen experience you can lose yourself in that's not too long this is not a bad choice but I'd be inclined to wait for it to go on sale as it's quite pricey for what it is."

Overall I think Unpacking is a good game. It has a very cozy atmosphere and tells a sweet story, with an appealing art style and chill music. If you are looking for something not too challenging but still a logic puzzle of sorts to play after a day that's been just too demanding, Unpacking would fit the bill quite well.

My one big issue, same as many others have already said, is the price for the amount of content that is here. As of this review, I'm just under 4 hours of playtime, and I've already completed the game and unlocked every achievement, despite playing at a fairly relaxed pace. I would suggest getting this game on sale (ideally 50% off or better) if you are at all interested in it."
unpacking,Not Recommended,8.7,"Posted: November 20, 2021
Tl;dr: Wait for this game to go on sale.

The only reason I don't recommend this game is because it's extremely overpriced for what you get. It's very relaxing and it tells a heartfelt story of someone growing up and discovering themselves. But it costs twice as much as it should.

I completed the game in 3.5 hours then spent some time rewatching what I'd done to get to the 4.3 hours of play mark. There is little to no replay value, either, as it always tells the same story with the same items. I wish it had an endless/sandbox mode where it randomized items and room layouts, or let us choose the furniture or aesthetic of the items. As is, I enjoyed it, but feel I could have spent my money better elsewhere."

This is a cute and enjoyable experience. It's nice to see the different ways people tackle a common task and something that would normally be a chore is turned into a fun and nearly exciting little game with its fun music and charming art style. For the 3 hours that it lasted, it was definitely interesting to unbox someone's life and perceive a story through their belongings.

However, this game is unfortunately overpriced. While I can always appreciate smaller developers joining the scene, it is also important to know how much an experience is worth. While captivating and intriguing, this game also offers minimal repeatability and does not provide an unforgettable time. The most notable feature of this game is the fact that it is unique, but would otherwise quickly lose it's charm the more that it is explored; especially as a genre.

I do recommend this game as it can be very fun for a marginally definite group of people, but for myself do I not believe it to be worth the amount I paid or the experience it provided. That being said, cool game!"

While the complaints of the game being rather short for the price do have some merit (taking my time to unpack each level and getting all of the achievements took a little under 4 hours), I still wouldn't trade this experience for the world. As advertised, this is a very zen puzzle game that has just enough 'puzzle' to keep it interesting while being more than 'zen' enough to make it a non-frustrating experience. While I very much enjoyed the gameplay aspect - the feeling of everything getting put in its place is just absolutely amazing beyond description - as well as the fantastically relaxing soundtrack, I was surprised by how much the storytelling aspect actually blew me away. Just all in all an absolutely fantastic experience, with a soft and sweet ending that genuinely made me cry, and I will undoubtedly be booting this up in the future to find new ways to unpack the rooms and relax in the future."

First and foremost... I think you may need a box of tissues - maybe. I certainly bawled my eyes out, maybe because it was in a way daunting at times thinking of actually being the person cramming yourself into someone else's tiny living space you now share... and then moving on... I cried hardest at the end, like a relieved, happy cry. It's so good. I am not normally one to write reviews but I think it's especially important for a tinier game like this.
You'll probably spend a few hours in this and maybe see some new things in someone's house you don't recognise, running from room to room trying to figure out ""why the hell did that go on top of the fridge?"". You won't mind, though. Please give this game a chance. It's ""environmental storytelling"" at a level you can interact with and be a part of. Lots of little fun things to look at and see what comes along each time.

On one hand the story the game tells through subtext feels sweet and complete. But on the other hand I can't say that I wouldn't love to see more content for a game like this. I could honestly probably play so many more hours if this game was expanded.

For example - it would've been wonderful to see the devs tell other people's stories too - with new locations, storage challenges, new items to unbox for the different personalities, hobbies, and styles - plus some new achievement stickers to go with it. For some reason - the idea of designing your own space and curating your own clothes and items also sounds like a hypothetically appealing addition to this game. But at the same time that kind of just sounds like I'm describing The Sims 4 Build & Buy mode - so maybe scratch that last idea.

It's just so satisfying, the devs have really itched a part of my psyche with this game, I don't know why but moving these 2D pixel art objects around a room is so calming. So I can't help but feel a bit disappointed that there won't be any new content for this wonderful game. But I still enjoyed the experience of playing it, and will no doubt play it again and again.

I've begun to feel like there could be a tiny little hole in the market for another game to come a long and create a similar experience that is more expansive. But even if that does happen, there will always be something special about Unpacking for me - it's charm is unforgettable imo.

While I personally would say it was worth the $20 I spent on it, some may not feel the same way - especially if there isn't as much replay-ability for them as there is for me. Cause the initial play through is rather short after all. So if your unsure I'd say wait till it's on sale."

There is zero replayability with this game and you finish in just a few hours, which makes me realize it's not worth the $20. If there were frequent updates with new rooms or content, it might be worth the cost."

I have not finished the game yet, but I was rooting for this young girl to get confident in her art.
As I was progressing through the years, seeing the place for her diploma being under her bed, having no desk to work or no real space for her really live killed me. I'm in 2015 now, you go girl, you're doing great, you got this. Your diploma is where is has to be, right on the wall, I'm glad it's there for people to see that you worked hard.

I know it's a game, but art is something that is often considered as a hobby and not a work, when you look at a piece of art for 3 seconds before going to the next, you don't see the hours poured in the piece, even less the years of work for this art to even exist.
Don't speak to an artist telling them they are gifted, like one day, they got ""art"" as superpower. They worked really hard for you to see that picture, read that book, watch that short, etc. Art is a work and deserve as much consideration as any other.

So for those who read this, I'm going to give you a challenge. When you'll have a look at a picture, don't scroll down quickly, give it at least 10 seconds and a like. If you're crazy, even share the art and make a comment. Those are what fuel the artists in confidence, this is what anybody practicing art needs along a huge cup of coffee.

Here is an addition I forgot to make explaining why I have such a long playing time on that game : I made a clue guide, not a walkthrough, a guide giving you clues to find what to do by yourself.

I love this game, it's very relaxing and fun. Although my issue is that it is very overpriced, im sorry but 30$ for this? The game play doesn't last long, and the game finishes fast. Sure you can do it again, but it's gonna be the same game play over and over. That can become repetitive and boring, I would spend my money on something more worth it.

This is such a nice little indie game, but seriously why such an expensive price tag? I got it 30% off (cheapest sale to date), and got only 5 hours of play time taking my sweet, sweet time. Game is honestly perfect at what it's trying to do and the environmental storytelling is cute, but jeez it's hard to justify such a steep price for such a short game.

Oh well, it at least was fun to play the ideal millennial fantasy of owning a home and being in a loving relationship."

This game is the masterclass of environmental storytelling. No I'm not kidding.

The game is very relaxing, but it's extremely overpriced.

I have bought this game on sale, because I have heard how relaxing that game is and I thought with my anxiety disorder it might be a good idea to try it out. And in fact it did help me relax and it was fun to unpack the belongings of the person whose life you are following, to learn a bit about their life and story from childhood all the way into adulthood.
However I have finished this game in only a bit over 3 hours, where I did rather often not pay attention to the game due to having to leave my computer for a bit, and for a game that on sale still had cost me 12€ and has absolutely no replayability whatsoever, I genuinely feel like I have wasted my money a bit. I have paid less for games that had more gameplay to offer.

But the price aside, the game itself is very nice. As mentioned it is incredibly relaxing in my personal opinion, with some nice music and very pretty visuals. In general the art style is really sweet and the story you get to see is very heartfelt. Also you can place everything almost everywhere that you want, which makes it interesting to see the way other people unpacked everything.

So all in all, I can certainly recommend the game if you are after something very relaxing and super sweet. But simply not at that price, even when on sale."

Unpacking is a charming, relaxing puzzle game.
Each level has the same goal, in a different location, you just moved in, and need to unpack and place your stuff. There is no time limit, just a homey soundtrack and the sounds of opening boxes and placing your items.
The puzzle aspect comes into play once you placed everything. The game wants certain items in certain places to complete a level. But this can also be disabled in the option, so you can place everything where you feel it’s best suited.
Through the different locations, which are separated by a couple of years each, and the items you unpack, Unpacking tries to tell its story and makes you think about what is happening in the life of the person you unpack the boxes for.
A perfect game, for when you just want to relax and calm down a for a bit :)"

This game is vastly overpriced for what it is. That being said the content is cute. But you're play time is maybe an hour; two hours max. 4-8 hours is a gross overestimation.

I am super loving this game.
Already hooked, and am on the 4th level so far.
I love the cute pixel aesthetic, and it feels really calming to just choose where you want to place things, and in the end design the room the way you want it.
Only issue so far is some items are confusing where they can go; on the third level I couldn't hang my towel up in the Bathroom on an empty towel rack with the others, and instead had to place it in my wardrobe?? Same with my apron that I also put in the wardrobe instead of the Kitchen.
Played this while taking a break from studying for end of year exams, and it's super relaxing to play. Looking forward to playing this more after I finish them!
In the end, what the Devs have made here is a super fantastic and fun game, and I can't wait to see how well this game does in the future. Glad that my fellow Australians are in the limelight from this one."

I bought this game when it was on sale and it's a cute game with a charming story. It's relaxing to play, sorting items and building a home while watching someone's life play out but the game is EXTREMELY short. There's only so many different places the game lets you put items, so the replay value is limited and I believe 20$ is FAR to much to be asking for a game like this. I completed the entire game (100% completion with all achievements) in less than 4.5 hours. If you really want to play this game I would recommend buying it while it's on sale.

Not a bad game overall, but overpriced for how little game there actually is."

Unpacking one’s belongings after moving to a new place could be a stressful operation, but it could also be a zen-like, nostalgic moment: you see your life condensed in a box, you reminisce upon the memories that each item brings up and you assign a new home on a shelf or in a drawer for each of these memory shards. Unpacking manages to capture these feelings perfectly, conveying a relaxing and evocative experience, and delivering a subtle and emotional story that is told solely through its gameplay and environment, without words.

Unpacking 
A Screenshot of Unpacking
By: 🍒 Lilly (🌸◠‿◠)

Each of the 8 levels in Unpacking represents a different stage in life and different living quarters to decorate. They spawn over a period of 21 years, starting from early childhood when the faceless protagonist first received her own room and ending in adulthood as a fully accomplished woman. As you pull the items one by one out of the boxes that are stacked in every room and find places for each of them, her life slowly unravels before your eyes: an ever growing collection of stuffed toys, a framed diploma here, an award later, some profession-related items that suggest an artistic career, or others that indicate the relationship status in that specific period of her life etc.

Apart from some specific cases, the objects are not interactive, and clicking them also doesn’t produce any text prompts but they subtly convey what happened in the time period between two sequential levels. I would normally think that reading a few carefully chosen words reflecting the thoughts triggered by picking up a certain item would be an enhancement to the gameplay, yet in it's vastly more satisfying to discover all the little details by yourself, and to assemble the whole picture from these pieces of information, like a jigsaw puzzle.


To some degree, the items have determined places or particular types of locations and after all the items are placed down, the ones with an incorrect positioning are highlighted with a red border. Rearranging things so that they fit in the spaces allocated is part of the gameplay and it also brings more realism to the game. For example, you don't know beforehand how many clothing objects you'll have to place in the wardrobe and how many available hangers there are, or how many books a certain collection has, therefore in the end you'll likely need to move some of the items around. For those that prefer more flexibility, the strict positioning of the items can be turned off from the option menu yet this diminishes the puzzle aspect of the game.

Aside from the obviously gorgeous pixel graphics and the chill, tranquil gameplay, the feature I liked the most in the game was the ability to watch a replay of a level at high speed, with all the movements I made while solving it. Additionally, this can then be exported into a gif or a video.


is not only a very relaxing game, but also a wholesome one and overall an extremely satisfying experience, especially for people like me, who enjoy living in an orderly environment. My only complaint about the game is that the asking price of $20 is too high for the 3-4h of fun that it offers - it would be great if more levels are added in the future and included in the same price, yet at the moment there’s no information about that. It does have some replayability value if you reset the levels, although replaying them does not bring anything new to the game. features Steam-integrated achievements, the majority of which are awarded for doing things a bit differently than what you’d expect, yet still extremely trivial to obtain (by placing some of the objects in some peculiar locations)."

I did enjoy this game very much and found joy in the little details as well as the soothing music. But 20 Euros is too much for about 3 hours of gameplay. Yes, the rewind and GIF feature are cute, but nobody really uses it. I am hoping that the devs update the game with more content or and endless modus. Because otherwise I really can't recommend this game to anyone for this price."

Yes, it costs 20 moneys and there are games that will run you for a lot longer than Unpacking for that price. But do those games let you organize underwear by colour? Do they let you organize books by size? Do they let you put all your man's clothes under the bed while you take over his wardrobe? ♥♥♥♥ up his colour coded kitchen with your ugly appliances? I don't think so. If this game isn't for you, it's just not for you, go spend those 20 moneys on an anime girl on a gacha or something. This game is for ME.

tldr: I really liked this game, recommend."

The game that proves unpacking can be a moving experience.

So what’s there to do in Unpacking? Unpack. Simple as that. Each level tasks the player with taking a series of boxes and emptying their contents, positioning them one-by-one in appropriate places around each room. These tasks start out simple, with the player needing to unpack only an individual room, and slowly progress into larger areas spanning an entire household. This is simple and flawless gameplay at its finest, one that developer self-describes as “zen block-fitting puzzle”. But it’s so much more than that.

The key gameplay concept of Unpacking is one that is innately human: moving house. Each room is initially bare, devoid of any sort of homeliness. Piece by piece, the player removes an item at a time from each box and can position them in any spot around each room. Although it might be entertaining to put a stuffed toy on the toilet (toylet?) or hide a Gameboy under your pillow, every item has its appropriate place to call home. During the level you’ll be given the freedom to place items wherever you wish, but upon unpacking all the items the player may be prompted that some don’t quite align with the room’s aesthetic. So you’d better put that toilet roll where it belongs, and make sure to move all those dirty cups out of your bedroom while you’re at it.

Zen is exactly the perfect descriptor for this style of gameplay. There is no time limit, no pressure, and really very little element of stress or challenge. Players may proceed at their own pace, taking time to appreciate their surroundings, slotting each new item into their new home. This slow-paced gameplay becomes especially important when admiring the game’s stunning visuals, which hold an impressive amount of detail and are full of clever references and nods to pop culture.

Story

Taking a back seat in Unpacking, much of the story is left up to the interpretation of the player. Cleverly presented across a series of levels, the player experiences a lifetime of unpacking from childhood bedrooms through to independent adulthood. Each stage begins with the year in which it is occurs, setting the scene for the gameplay that follows. Once completed, a photograph of the completed room is taken and lovingly stuck into to a photo album with a short comment explaining the situation.

Although the presentation of Unpacking’s story is done in such a minimalist style, Witch Beam manage to expertly convey a convincing sense of raw human emotion. I can’t go into significant detail in discussing the story that unfolds, but there are moments where this game will make you feel deep sadness, conflicting regret, and an overwhelming sense of joy. There are many elements of the game that I’m sure that players will be able to relate to their own experiences of moving house, as there are many themes that resonate with what it means to be human.

Visuals

Realism and pixel art harmoniously unite in Unpacking, which offers a detailed and vibrant pixel art aesthetic that is among some of the best to date. Don’t expect the blocky 8-bit or 16-bit pixel art that many other indie games lean towards; this is pixel art that imitates real life. From the designs of houses and rooms all the way down to its smallest contents, the visuals of Unpacking are not only highly-detailed and realistic, but carry an underlying charm to every item that is delicately moved out of its box.

If you consider yourself a geek, the art in Unpacking will appeal to you on so many levels. Rooms are crammed with electronics, Monster Manuals, lovingly-crafted miniatures, and even half-finished cosplay outfits that adorn mannequins. Throughout every minute of gameplay I found myself needing to stop and admire the intricate details, like deliberately-crafted videogame consoles, game and DVD cases that perfectly capture real-life cover art, adorable sets of plush toys, and even the beauty of the simplest day-to-day items like toiletries and stationary. Items may even change as they are brought along to several locations, becoming worn or weathered over time like an old mouse pad or a treasured stuffed toy.

Audio

Pixel art calls for chiptunes, but just like Unpacking’s incorporation of realism in its visuals, so too does it add real life to its music through the use of many instruments. The core foundation of the soundtrack is a chill synth with chiptunes to carry the melody, harmoniously interwoven with a mix of acoustic guitar, funky bass, and even some solemn piano for the game’s more poignant moments. Gorgeous tunes from Canadian-Australian composer, Jeff Van Dyck, set the mood for the rest of the game.

But it’s not just the music of Unpacking that will delight your eardrums, there are minute details throughout to impress any audiophile. For example, picking up and placing every single item in the game is accompanied by a unique sound effect depending on the object and surface on which it is placed. There’s a great degree of detail to the sound design – even to the point of hearing game discs rattle in their case when placed on a shelf, or the satisfying thud of a book laid face down. Environmental cues too remind you clearly that the game is taking place in subtropical Australia, with background chattering of Rainbow Lorrikeets and whistling of Honey Eaters while leaves calmly rustle in the wind. So satisfying.

Extras

Outside of the main game, which will take approximately 4 hours to complete, the game has some extra content to keep players coming back for more. Each level has some hidden secrets when placing an item in a peculiar or perfect spot – doing so will reward the player with a sticker and an achievement. These stickers can be used in the game’s photo mode, where the player is given access to all sorts of filters and adjustments to showcase that game’s beautiful art. I spent quite a bit of time in the photo mode, which can produce some pictures that are truly wallpaper-worthy.

Conclusion

There are few games I’ve played that I can say are truly beautiful, heart-warming and touching, but Unpacking is all that and so much more. Such a simple gameplay concept not only manages in itself to be incredibly entertaining and strangely satisfying, but when combined with detailed pixel art and themes of human emotion, manages to become almost poetic. Even the simplest moments of the game have the ability overwhelm the player with joy and happiness. This gameplay is one that could have great impact – I’d personally love to see it applied to different situations, like those less fortunate who have been driven out of home for reasons beyond their control.

Witch Beam have created a game unlike any other I’ve played, and if you are a human with a heart, I implore you to experience it as well. Unpacking truly is a moving game in every sense of the word.

So, why should you play it?
- Simple, elegant, and satisfying gameplay.
- Stunning and detailed pixel art.
- Plenty of clever pop-culture references.
- Deeply emotional story despite minimal dialogue.
- Impressive attention-to-detail through audio design.

But why shouldn’t you play it?
- Players looking for a lengthy experience may be dissatisfied.
- You’ve only ever lived in one place and have never had to unpack.

Absolutely lovely style and game play is cute. I did really feel like I got to know the character. However, the reason I cannot recommend this game is because it lasted only 3 hours! That's easily one of the shortest games I've ever played, especially for this price! I bought it on sale and it's still crazy expensive for what you get. I hope eventually there might be updates and more stories but as the game is now, I cannot recommend it."

Cute art and story, however, I finished it in under 3 hours. Which for me is NOT worth $20. If it were a mediocre game I'd pay $4.99, but since it's cute I'd still say they're charging double what it's worth. Feels like a robbery honestly. Especially considering there are a couple levels with only one or two rooms, out of I believe 7 levels. I wouldn't buy it unless its on sale or you have money to throw away."

Ignore playtime. I played it in offline mode.

Many will scoff at the $20 price tag but I can see the love and devotion put in the game. Sound design and pixel design isn't easy, even in this day and age. The developers put in a crazy amount of sound effects so that putting items in various areas spots makes a different sound. I would certainly hope the $20 contributes to paying the developers, sound artists, and graphic artists a a good wage for their effort in this.

The game is charming and relaxing. The only complaint that I have about the game is that it's short. I certainly would love to see more, as in a different story with different items or something similar to that. The game can be a little finicky when it comes to the placement of different items but it's not hard to figure it out where it needs to go. But sometimes it can feel like it's a bit of a puzzle game to ensure that you're arranging things properly so that everything has its place.

If you're a stickler for organization, there's certainly a chance that you're playing the game a lot longer than average, but it will certainly tickle your categorizing/organizing fancy.

If you enjoy incredible pixel art, this game is for you.
If you're looking for something relaxing and laid back, this game is for you.
If you like organizing and arranging, this game is for you.

To me, it's worth the price. Especially if it means that there's an opportunity for more of this game or a sequel or something. I just want more of this!

All in all 8.5/10"

I love the concept, and most of the game play is reasonably enjoyable. What super ruined it for me though is how certain items need to be placed in very specific rooms or places in rooms..

That journal? No, you can't place it on the shelf or desktop, it must go IN THE DRAWER.
That small trashcan? No, that can't go in the bathroom, that's supposed to be in the bedroom..
That game/movie case? No, you can't put that on the coffee table, that needs to go on the shelf!
That laundry basket? No, you need to move it ONE SPACE CLOSER TO THE LAUNDRY ROOM CLOSET THING.

As soon as I realized the game was gonna tell me where certain things had to go and I wasn't really quite as free to place things how I wanted, the rest of the levels became a slog to quickly place things wherever they were probably wanted to I could get the little ""this needs to be placed somewhere else"" outline so I could finish the level."

Very pretty pixel art, but not worth the price asked for. Barely three hours of content and very restrictive, you can't actually decorate the levels the way you'd like, every item has a specific place and the game won't let you finish till you put things where they're supposed to be."

There should be a competing title in this genre so that EA won't keep cashing in on this community which has been more and more lenient and tried its best to put up with whatever bs dlc the devs have put together. It's a shame that this franchise has fallen so far.
Pros:
-Bunch of really nice quality of life features compared to the previous titles
Con:
-The game feels soulless and cutting corners at every possible opportunity to do so.
-DLC price tag unjustified unlike the previous titles
-Terrible and baffling game design decisions everywhere, they're some of the most cored features too
-Action queue is extremely buggy years after the game's release, the amount of time for a sim to perform action/idling is nonsensical.
-Removed sandbox design and put in the older scene/lot system is such a backwards compromise that's almost certainly done for technical/engine limits reason, such a shame to see so much game design potential being thrown into the trash because they chose the easy way out.(As expected, the decision here came back to bite them when they design some of the dlc content, which feels really disrupted by the constant fast travelling"

I love The Sims. I love The Sims 4. Here's why I don't recommend it.

-Still launches through Origin. Buying on Steam just adds another layer of DRM.
-If you previously purchased through Origin, you will need to redownload any DLC, even if you already had it installed
-Your DLC carries over, the base game does not, which means you'll have to purchase the base game again.
-Your DLC doesn't 'unlock' through Steam's store, if you purchased it on Origin (because of course it doesn't)

This is probably the worst Steam integration I've ever seen. Don't buy it here if you already own it, just use ""add non-Steam game to library"". It's almost identical and $20 cheaper."

TLDR: DO NOT BUY BASE SIMS 4!! Buy it HEAVILY DISCOUNTED bundled with one of the major expansions (Seasons or Pets), and MOD THE ♥♥♥♥ OUT OF IT!!


Base Sims 4 is nearly unplayable due to the lack of content, repetitive and easily manipulative emotions system, and an overall feeling of restriction. Which is damaging in a game series that is designed around player freedom. There are also so many irritating qualities to it that make it seem like it wasn't fine tweaked enough. Why is every single Sim such a social butterfly that I cannot get them to stop talking to each other for five seconds? Why do they take so long to eat? Why are the lots so small and so empty? Why is nearly nothing from Sims 3, and heck, even Sims 2 brought over?? (Horses, Cars, pools, restaurants, grocery stores, fun recreational activities, ect.)

With that being said, there is some classic Sim Fun to be had with this game, if you are able to get it for a heavily discounted price and get it bundled with one of the major expansions (I would recommend either Pets or Seasons). I would also highly recommend downloading a plethora of Mods, because they fix a vast majority of the systems in base Sims 4 that make it more enjoyable. If Mods are not your thing, then I would think twice about purchasing this game. **This is one of the easiest games to Mod fyi**

Mod Recommendations (Like seriously, don't even play base Sims 4 before downloading these Mods)

Sims 4 Mod Manager by Raxdiam (Not necessary, but a very convenient and easy way to keep track of your mods. Very user friendly, will do 100% of the work for you)

Meaningful Stories by roBurky (A mod pack that effectively revamps the mood and emotions systems of Sims 4. This makes the systems feel waaay more fleshed out and realistic, and significantly less manipulatable)

Better Romance by simler90 (Adds more rules and checks into how Sims romance one another. In base Sims 4, you are basically always guaranteed to succeed in romance. There is quite literally no way to fail. This Mod expands heavily upon it, making it so that the traits Sims have will impact whether or not they will accept any advances.)

Wonderful Whims by TURBODRIVER (Goes great with Better Romance with no compatibility issues that I'm aware of. Adds in an Attractiveness system, first Impressions, Personality Archetypes, and even a Menstrual Cycle and Birth Control system. With this, you are more equipped to design your Sims overall sexuality and sexual lives. Hugely rewarding, and designed perfectly that it will seem like it is a natural part of the game.)

There is also a ♥♥♥♥ load of CC (Custom Content) out there like clothes, hair, buildings, Sims, ect. ""Mod The Sims"" is the best place to find all of this. Don't spend money on any of the Stuff Packs, because most of that stuff included in them you'll find for free made by someone online. Usually looks nicer too."

My Gf loves and plays this game a lot. but i have noticed The whole DLC packages for the game is total rip off. I understand maybe buying a pass for x of dlc but the fact you have to pay for each one is an actual joke. making them spend £18 plus to be a werewolf, Vampire or to just have a Pet. They even charge for seasons like snow etc. It's EA so makes sense, This game is the literal embodiment of slicing up the game and selling the pieces back to consumers. Or a 1000 piece jigsaw but charging you after 10 pieces have been put together. They don't even give loyal or franchise veterans anything for free. If you're rich or don't intend on buying loads of DLC maybe buy this game. Fans should take a stand and boycott the franchise to stop their greed until they remove this awful scheme of extracting money from fans. I hope sims fans get an apology but also more of making sure fans actually get the content they pay for when they buy the game."

The base game has about $5 worth of content. Why? Because EA do what EA does, it cost around $2000 cad to get the full game. I wish I was kidding. The DLC cost just that much and they put so little into the base game so in order to enjoy the game you have to buy the DLC. Why do people support this crap? How is this legal?

Before this review, I feel like it's important to say that I have more than 23.7 hours in this game. A LOT more. I've got that much alone on PS4, and 500+ hours on my original origin account, which I can sadly no longer access to check the exact number. I got this game 9 years ago, full price retail, and have played it on and off since the age of 9. I've played this game to death over the years, and that's why it hurts me to leave a negative review. You can still have fun with it, and I will explain that, but it's flaws are just too plentiful for me to leave a positive review.

It would be easy to say that this game used to be great, but that... would be a blatant lie. The game was barren when it released. Key features from past games were missing, like toddlers and POOLS. How were we supposed to kill our sims now? Give them a long and happy life until a natural death? Hardly! Along with that, the map screens didn't even have colour; they were pure white, sterile places. Maybe it was supposed to be stylistic, but... I can't help but think about how much cheaper it must have been.

Slowly, over the years, we started to get more DLC packs of various tiers. It didn't start out too egregious, I wouldn't say. Sure, Luxury Party Stuff was lacklustre, but we had things like Outdoor Retreat to keep us going! Though, it was hard not to note how quickly EA had jumped to make DLC whilst the core game was missing such basic features. That isn't even to say how the community at large took the closed-world and lack of colour and pattern customisation. I'll tell you how they took it; badly. They took it badly.

With all this DLC, there was a problem.

IT. DIDN'T. STOP.

Now, it's normal for a Sims game to have a large amount of DLC. But this? It became staggering. As of this review, all of the DLC for this game will run you over $800.

OVER. EIGHT. HUNDRED. DOLLARS.

I'll let that sink in.

Have you ever wondered how this game is free? That's how. It's not like this DLC is truly optional. Some of it is, sure! But would you like your life simulator to have weather? A normal amount of clothes? More than THREE PLACES TO LIVE, ONE OF THEM BEING AN EMPTY FIELD? Then you'd best pony up! It's hard to fully express how empty this game feels without DLC. And EA knows it feels that empty, and that they can keep milking us for every last cent.

At this point, you may have noticed something, or you may have not. And that's the fact that I said I've been playing this game for nine years. And that means the game has been out for nine years now. Since 2014. This game is almost a decade old. This is an issue. A big issue. When this game first released, it prided itself on it's intelligent autonomous sims. They can multitask; like watching television AND eating at the same time! Wowzers! But with this much time having passed, you'd be hard pressed to find somebody confident to call these sims anything above 'serviceable, I guess'. Your sims will wash their plates in the bathroom! Your sims will grab water if you leave them alone for two seconds and drink until they experience bladder failure! Your sims will start a fight with their spouse, seemingly just for kicks! Your sims will stop moving until you reset them with a cheat code! Your sims will be left with an undeletable action in their queue until you, again, use a cheat code! You get the picture. This game is a mess, with problems that could be wiped clean in a theoretical Sims 5. So why don't they?

Because EA have created a live-service single-player game, and they'd be stupid to give it up.

This live-service model, piling DLC upon DLC onto the game? It's managed to cause even more issues than the game had to begin with. Each new download comes with new bugs unique in nature. Oops, there go your textures! Oops, your sims are now all autonomously screaming at each other! Oops, your Sims are BUILDING ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEIR OWN CHILDREN! These are the kinds of things you'll have to get used to, and this only gets worse each time they add DLC. There are problems in this game that have become support beams by this point; fix those bugs, and everything will fall apart. So they just... don't! The Sims 4 is fundamentally broken, and they won't throw the game out and start fresh, because the horse they're beating still isn't dead. Just bleeding and shambling.

This greed helped lead to the point we've reached today. Even with the uproar against My First Pet Stuff (A DLC for a DLC), it seemed enough people were content to buy such a tiny stuff pack because we got a whole new category for things just like it.

Kits. Dear lord, kits. These things aren't popular with the community, and it's clear to see why. Such meagre amounts of items might seem doable at $5 a pop, but they're adding up, and quick. Filled with lacklustre designs that only work well as a base for custom content, they're the peak of EA's lazy contributions to this game.

I mentioned custom content, so I suppose that's a horse out the stable now. Yeah, custom content is amazing. And that's because EA has no hand in it. Well, I should give them a little credit; the native mod support is an honestly nice touch! There's your first positive, EA.

Custom content is a general term for items created by the community. Clothes, furniture, accessories, you name it! With multiple dedicated sites to download it, and fan made tools that make creation easy, it's great! And by easy, I mean easy. I was making Pokemon shirts for my games at age 12. Just takes a little research. All these items come in two main styles; one more realistic (Alpha) and one to match the game's items (Maxis Match). Build up a good folder filled with gigabytes of fashion and get to work living your life in Create-A-Sim; don't forgot to buy a new SD card to fit it all in. You'll need it.

It's not just custom content that the community makes. There's also good old fashioned script mods. These have all sorts of functions; they can fix some in-game issues, add entirely new game mechanics, give you features that you always wanted (controllable pets comes to mind), and more. (More including the... infamous Wicked Whims and Extreme Violence mods. Ah, timeless classics). All these mods help breathe new life into the game and show how passionate this community can be, no matter how downtrodden by the source material.

These mods help to show how this game is actually fun at it's core. You might have read all this ragging and be baffled by my heel-turn, but it's true. Why else would I have put in all those hours? That core gameplay loop of letting your sims lead their lives is damn fun, and I can't help but enjoy it; even with everything EA is doing.

I think that others could enjoy it too if they started playing today. There is something here, at the heart of it. It's just coated in a decade of bloat and greed.

(This segment is a replacement for an old one that caused me issues, that I'm removing to keep this review safe. I think you can tell by the comments below and the tone of this review what that was, and you can take that as you wish.)

Anyway, EA can do one, and you should give Sims 4 a chance, if you like. There's good here, but this game reeks of greed and jank at it's core."
the+sims+4,Not Recommended,397.1,"Posted: June 9, 2022
This is my favorite game that I can't recommend. I love this game, as my playtime will tell, and I will continue to pour more hours into this game. I'm not giving a negative review because of the game's ""fun factor."" It's very destressing, it's chill, its difficulty is all in the hands of the players. The modding scene is great, and the creative possibilities are infinite. On paper, the Sims 4 seems like the dream game. A perfect game that even people who have literally never touched a game before in their life can pick up and play. In reality, EA has erected a massive series of walls that you have to scale to reach that state, and this is the crux of the review. The ultimate problem is, and is the whole reason I'm giving this a negative review, is recommending people to buy this game because of the aforementioned walls. To say that they have become untenable is an understatement. They are nigh insurmountable at this point.

The first wall, and this is the point where most people stop at, is the pricing. It being free-to-play as of October 18th does not save this from being HORRIDLY expensive through DLC cost. The base Sims 4 with no expansions or packs, makes the game EXTREMELY limited in scope as to what you can do. Want to be a spellcaster? Want to attend university? Have cats or dogs? Have changing seasons in the weather? Form clubs? Get famous? Have a job? That's ALL locked behind DLC that is either the same price as the base game, or, get this, DOUBLE the price of the base game. All those things I listed? Those are SEPARATE DLCs! If you were to not get them on sale, it would run you a couple HUNDRED already! And this just getting started. On the store page, as I'm typing this right now, it lists 56 different DLC, and to buy them all in one fell swoop costs just short of a THOUSAND dollars. Nobody in their right mind should make that investment, and I can't be of the mind to tell someone to spend that much on a single game.

Now, to play Devil's Advocate for a moment, this is only as bad if you buy it when it isn't on sale, which the game goes on quite frequently. Deep sales, in fact! Up to 75% a lot of things, which bring down the price for everything by a couple hundred dollars. In fact, with the Summer Sale that's coming up as of the time of writing this review, this game will most likely get significant price slashes. However, to counter that point, the asking price is still SEVERAL HUNDRED DOLLARS. The prices become more manageable, but it is still a SIGNIFICANT investment. More of an investment than, frankly, I think this game deserves. And considering how Sims 3 with everything still costs such an outrageous amount, it would seem that those prices aren't going anywhere for the time being.

If a high asking price was all that kept people away, I suppose you could argue the point that not recommending a game you like because of pricing is silly. That if you put hundreds of hours in like I have, the price is ""worth it."" Perhaps that argument would have grounds and I would entertain it, if not for the fact that the game in of itself just fundamentally DOES NOT WORK with everything combined. These are the other walls, and this can become overwhelming for the inexperienced. Even if you buy everything and you jump in, the Sims 4 is a strange program that seemingly randomly decides to brick itself every so often, without you even really being the cause of it. There are so many bugs and glitches that have no fixes for it, merely ways to temporarily relieve of you of it, much like ibuprofen for a headache. And they aren't the silly, funny glitches seen in Skyrim.

For example, randomly, the game will begin to run under 30 frames after exiting build mode, and you solve it by merely pausing the game and unpausing it. Not a terrible bug but it's pretty much the epitome of the problems I have with this game: everything is just player made solutions rather than an official bug fix. It will happen again, and instead of just fixing it, EA just tells you what you can do to help yourself with it. You'll be doing this often, spending hours looking up some obscure error, through no fault of your own, because either Sims 4 randomly decides to brick your Resources.cfg after update and makes it impossible for you to play with CC of any kinds, or your anti virus somehow marks this entire game as potential ransomware, or the Sims 4 randomly just corrupt your save file and you're trying to figure out how to fix that. And that's just on the meta side of everything.

File headaches aside, the game itself just acts wonky as well, adding its own walls to scale. A cursory glance at the reviews for the DLCs illustrate the absolute nightmares that spawn with these additions, but I'll share some of the errors I've had on my end. I've had multiple instances where I tell a Sim to fulfill their hygiene need and their immediate first instinct is to...run out and clean a solar panel? In place of just taking a shower in one of the MULTIPLE showers that exist in that house? I tell them to fulfill their energy need, thinking they'll go to bed, and they'll either randomly decide to back float in the pool, or drink an incredibly irresponsible amount of coffee, like a third shift worker going off of only three hours of sleep. Fixed all of this by manually telling them what to do. I've also had moments where I couldn't wash laundry because the game bugged out my washer and dryer, where the prompts for washing never came up. Only the prompts for putting the dirty laundry in and taking the dirty laundry out. Fixed by selling the set and then buying another. I've also had my weather permanently glitch itself into never changing at all. Where it snows all through winter and all through spring, causing me to have to buy a weather changing device in game and use it. Sims will randomly drop whatever they are doing to do some unrelated task, such as stop cooking to randomly mold some hunk of clay sitting in some corner of the room. Sometimes, my Sims will also stand still with the ""chat with (sim)"" action in the queue, but then never actually chat with that person,, for whatever reason, causing them to bug ouit and need them to be reset. The list goes on and on, and I think you've gotten the point already.

Again, these are fixed by just manually selecting actions, using console commands, and removing the bugged items in question. I know what you're thinking. Why are you complaining about bugs that have an in game solution? The issue is, again, that this is just player solutions for problems that aren't being fixed. You're paying hundreds of dollars for this game and the DLC. You'd expect a level of polish to behind this, but there isn't. Players shouldn't have to actively fight against a game they bought, only to find a bunch of band-aid, player made solutions a because the FEATURES IN GAME THEY PAID HUNDREDS FOR DOESN'T WORK AND EA DOESN'T DO ANYTHING TO FIX THEM.

It's all the same hackneyed excuse of ""there being so much in this game"" and sounding like they are some small game dev studio. All of this frustration after the ludicrous pay wall is just simply unforgivable, and to recommend people this game knowing the hours worth of troubleshooting and fixing I've had to do is like to encourage self destructive tendencies. I made the investment, I bought the steam edition to make a review. I sunk a lot both in time and money, and have got to a point where I can say I enjoy this game, perhaps through Sunken Cost reasoning and Stockholm Syndrome. But it required me having to scale multiple walls and slaying multiple beasts to get there, and that's just simply not a journey for everyone. I cannot look at someone and genuinely tell them to make the same investments I have, nor do I think EA should benefit from having people do so.

Edit: Also having Origin become a MANDATORY download that has to get loaded EACH time sucks.

Edit 2: Sims 4 is now free to play, but my thumbs down remains."

After coming from The Sims 3, I was severely disappointed. Setting aside all of the EAisms about the game (obscenely expensive expansions to get basic game play features that should be in the base game, over inclusion of social media aspects, etc.) I was expecting a phenomenal experience. Instead, they seem to have limited the ability to travel, removing the semi-open world of TS3 and instead reverting back to a very old school system of traveling to what basically amounts to a few city blocks, which was the most disappointing feature. You can no longer have your sims travel to work in a real environment, instead they do the ole disappearing act and reappear after 8 hours. No more travelling to a grocery store, all supplies are magically bought and created out of thin air. I felt like I was playing TS1 or 2 again, and everything feels very stripped down and bare-bones, very much like a mobile game.

To be fair, they have added a much more in depth sim creator, which is pretty cool if that's all you care about. The AI system seems to work better too with interactions between sims being more fluid and natural.

Overall, disappointed. Wouldn't recommend."

I am saying this for the people that ALREADY have this on ORIGIN
From all that I've seen. Despite me having the base game on Steam, and buying the DLCs from my previous experiences with Origin... IT DOESN'T MATTER.
It will say you have the DLCs, but because they aren't on steam you cant USE THEM. EA is really unnecessary with their expensive DLCs that aren't even that good TBH lets be real, 500 bucks for DLC that isn't even better than Sims 3 is kinda upsetting.
But they DONT EVEN LET YOU MOVE YOUR DLCS TO STEAM. EA HAVE PITY ON PEOPLE'S WALLETS PLEASE. THIS IS REALLY MEAN. If you change this later, thank you. Great. But honestly if you don't, no skin off my back. Done buying your stuff. if you already have this game on Origin, STAY THERE."
the+sims+4,Not Recommended,15.2,"Posted: June 19, 2022
I wanna start by saying Sims is always a classic. Each game they make improvements and there is always a level of enjoyment creating a false reality to live in. Even then, though, some key features are taken away for no reason (example color grids for anything rather than just makeup.) This game is just generally a good example of the EA way. Have an iconic well known title, make it only a small portion of the game and lock everything else, hanging the carrot in your face, with Expansion packs galore.
Would I recommend you play this game? Yes. Absolutley, if you have the actual FULL game or just any level of added content besides the base game it
Would i recommend you buy it? Maybe the base game on a steep sale. I'd say the base game by itself is worth maybe 5 bucks and the expansions, although they should be included to begin with, at most 2 dollars per expansion considering there are 56. that's still over 100 dollars.
Castrate me if you want. Pirate this game. EA does not need this money, they are and always have been greedy bastards."
the+sims+4,Not Recommended,0.8,"Posted: March 5, 2021
I went into this game thinking:""Wow I can't wait to see what Maxis and EA has done to improve on the Sims 3!"", only to realize after 40 minutes that there is little to no content that has been carried over from the other titles, and even if their is it's locked behind a 35$ dollar paywall. Oh and don't even try to think about buying all the DLCs because it will cost you 500$ to do so. No game deserves to be 500$. I mean if you're a popular youtuber you could get the DLCs for free?

So if you want a much more watered down almost mobile game level experience then buy this game if not stay the hell away from it. You know what? Just stay away from any EA game, it'll drain your money straight from your pocket. I really do hope when The Sims 5 comes out it's not like this but knowing EA it will be.

Edit: Oh hey, the full game is now 741$ dollars! Isn't that fun? Also to clarify, I had this game on PS4 before I decided to get it on PC, (For mods and other stuff like that), and it ran like ♥♥♥♥ on PS4 as well."

The game is good and enjoyable, however it can be both recommended and not.

The Sims 4"" builds upon the foundations laid by its predecessors, refining the gameplay mechanics and introducing new features that enhance the player's ability to create and control virtual lives. The game allows players to create and control virtual characters, build and furnish homes, and guide their Sims through various life stages and experiences.

Pros and cons
🟩 Positives 🟥 Negatives
- Robust building mechanics and extensive customisation options allow for highly detailed, personalised environments and characters.

- Open-ended approach to storytelling encourages player agency and immersion, fostering a sense of investment and attachment to the Sims and their lives.

- Emotions system adds depth and complexity to Sims' behaviour and interactions, encouraging players to consider their Sims' psychological and emotional well-being.

- User-generated content and modding community expand the game's creative possibilities and offer additional content and features. - Initial lack of content and features compared to previous iterations of the series may lead to frustration and dissatisfaction among players. Reliance on DLC and microtransactions may restrict access to certain content and features for players unwilling or unable to make additional purchases.

- The absence of certain features, such as curved walls or split-level structures, may limit the game's creative potential for some players.

- Monetisation strategies and content-locking practices have raised concerns about the game's accessibility and value for money.

The game retains the core gameplay mechanics of the series, allowing players to create and customise virtual characters, build and furnish homes, and guide their Sims through various life stages and experiences.

Another significant addition is the Emotions system, which adds depth and complexity to the Sims' behaviour and interactions. Sims can now experience a wide range of emotions, such as happiness, sadness, anger, and embarrassment, which are influenced by their environment, social interactions, and personal traits.

A central aspect of the sim's franchise experience is the building mechanics, which allow players to design, construct, and customise their Sims' homes and community lots.

One of the most notable improvements is introducing the room-based building system. This system allows players to create and manipulate individual rooms as modular units, making rearranging and modifying structures easier without requiring extensive reconstruction. This feature streamlines the building process and encourages experimentation. Thus, players can quickly test different layouts and configurations with minimal effort.

Another significant enhancement is the addition of the Build Mode catalogue, which offers a vast array of objects, materials, and decorative items for players to choose from. The catalogue is organised into intuitive categories and features a search function, making it easier for players to find and select the necessary items. This extensive selection of building and furnishing options enables players to create highly detailed and personalised environments that reflect their Sims' personalities, lifestyles, and aspirations.

Moreover, the game's vibrant modding community further enriches the building mechanics, which has produced a wealth of custom content, ranging from unique architectural elements to entire pre-built lots. This user-generated content expands the game's creative possibilities. It allows players to incorporate diverse styles and designs into their creations.

However, the building mechanics in ""The Sims 4"" have limitations. Some players have expressed frustration with the lack of certain features, such as the ability to create curved walls or split-level structures, which were available in previous iterations of the series. Additionally, the game's reliance on DLC and microtransactions mean that access to certain building materials and objects may be restricted for players who do not wish to make additional purchases.

In previous iterations of the series, certain features and content were included in the base game or expansion packs, providing players with a more comprehensive experience without additional purchases. However, ""The Sims 4"" has adopted a more aggressive monetisation strategy, with numerous expansion packs, game packs, and stuff packs that collectively add to a significant financial investment for players wishing to access the full range of content. This has led to concerns about the game's reliance on downloadable content (DLC) and microtransactions, which can be seen as a barrier to entry for players with limited financial resources.

This form of microtransactions has been criticised for several reasons. Firstly, it can be seen as a form of artificial content scarcity. Once part of the core experience, features and content are now gated behind additional purchases. This can lead to frustration and dissatisfaction among players, who may feel that they are being unfairly charged for content that should have been included in the base game.

Secondly, this monetisation strategy raises concerns about the potential normalisation of microtransactions in the gaming industry, as it may encourage other developers and publishers to adopt similar practices. This could shift towards a more fragmented and costly gaming landscape, where players are increasingly expected to pay for additional content to enjoy a complete and fulfilling experience.

It is important to critically evaluate these monetisation strategies and consider their implications for the gaming industry and player experience. While developers and publishers have a legitimate need to generate revenue to sustain their operations and continue producing high-quality games, it is essential to balance financial viability and provide a fair, accessible, and enjoyable experience for players. By supporting more ethical and consumer-friendly monetisation practices, players can help to shape a more sustainable and equitable gaming landscape for all.

""The Sims 4"" offers a unique and engaging virtual life simulation experience, building upon the foundations laid by its predecessors and introducing new features that enhance the player's ability to create and control virtual lives. The game's strengths lie in its emphasis on creativity, self-expression, and storytelling and its efforts to improve accessibility and inclusivity. However, I cannot recommend buying the game due to EA's monetisation strategy, but it is a ""fine"" game."

The Sims 4 is an expensive habit to keep if you are a person, like myself, who feels as if they absolutely must have every available DLC for a game which they enjoy. Without sales or bundling, as of writing this, the entirety of The Sims 4 will cost you a whopping $964.47. I can't say I am surprised, as this is an EA game, but that does not excuse the disgrace that price tag is.

On the other side of that spectrum, people who do not want to purchase any additional content, will more than likely be left dissatisfied with the base game. If you have played any of The Sims 4 predecessors, you will immediately notice that there are aspects ""missing"" from the base game experience that have either not been developed or have been withheld for the purpose of selling expansions/gamepacks/kits.

The more recently released packs have been borderline not play tested before release. If you check the credits for these packs you will notice a stark difference in the number of people developing these and the division of their roles compared to earlier packs. In the end, after a few patches, we do end up with something playable, but many bugs never get fixed.

I do believe it is possible to be satisfied with the game through two routes. Either A. The Sims 4 is your introduction to the franchise so you are unable to compare this title to its predecessors. or B. You curate a healthy mix of additional content alongside CC and mods.

Overall, I would give this game a 7/10 rating, only because of the healthy cc and mod community backing it.

Without any additional content, base game only, my rating drops to a 5/10- absolutely mediocre.

IN SUMMARY: too expensive for a complete experience, predecessors were better for gameplay (TS4 build/buy and character creation is superior imo), incredibly healthy modding community."

I have a long history with the Sims franchise. I started playing The Sims 2 when I was a child because of my mother (and, back in the day, even my grandmother played it). I remember The Sims 3 coming out. I've loved these games ever since I can remember, and they have a very special place in my heart.

Buying this game on Steam was kinda useless, seeing as I already owned it since its release in 2014 on Origin (frankly, I just wanted to see those hours pile up on Steam whenever I get into the cycle of Remember Game Exists > Play Game Obsessively For A Short Period > Forget Game Exists, and I felt a little guilty about my, uhm, less-than-legitimate maritime exploration, to put it in a cute little ~metaphor~, of all of the DLC content over the years).

Now, would I recommend The Sims 4? Honestly, it depends. There are many different kinds of Simmers, and I don't think this is the most adequate for every single one of them.

Lore-wise? Girl, put on an eyepatch and go explore the Sims 2. If you're expecting fleshed out, non-half-assed stories, this will disappoint. (And it has. Why did they do the Caliente sisters this dirty? Why? I just wanna know...)

Building-wise? 100% MADE FOR YOU, BUY IT. I have never considered myself a builder, ever, but this game... Oh, man, it really boosts my self-esteem, not gonna lie. Whenever I make house I'm really proud of, I showcase it to every one. It's great! I think everyone can agree that this game has the best Build-and-Buy Mode that the Sims franchise has ever seen.

CAS-wise? Hmmmm, this one is tricky. Creating Sims is so fun, it's true, but without Custom Content? It's a no-go for me, thank you very much. I've recently discovered that a lot of people find the Sims 3 sims ugly, and that was honestly a HUGE surprise to me, because although the sims in The Sims 4 are much more aesthetically pleasing than in any of the other games WITH CUSTOM CONTENT INCLUDED, if I have to create vanilla sims? Nope. They're just kinda weird-looking, in my opinion, and I'd much rather play The Sims 3 if I'm not gonna include custom content.

Now, one thing that should go without saying is that EA IS VERY GREEDY. This isn't news to anyone, I know, but I'm just saying this to emphasize that if you're not planning on buying any DLC for this game you may as well just go on a lawless maritime exploration of it instead of purchasing it, because the base game itself is NOT IT. At all. It gets boring after a while.

My strategy going forward is probably going to be: play game > forget it exists > remember it exists > get the cheapest pack I can > play game with its new features. The DLC is very expensive, though, and that is something to remember. The Sims 3, for example, is worth playing with just the base game installed, in my opinion, so if you don't like to get absolutely scammed into giving EA your money, maybe try that one? Just don't get the Katy Perry stuff pack if you do decide to buy DLC after all. It's not worth it, bestie.

(So, yes, while I know I am scamming myself at this point by monetarily supporting this game, I decided to do it anyway! It was an impulse-buy. But I digress,)

Overall, The Sims 4 has gotten a lot better since it started. It's had a few hiccups along the road, and that's without counting the Star Wars pack, because I refuse to acknowledge that it wasn't a random fever dream I had. But it has gotten better, and I'd say it's worth playing if you pick a few DLC that you think you'll enjoy, and some Custom Content to your liking! I'd also recommend some mods like MC Command Center or other story progression mods just to make the game more realistic and fun. The Sims 4 community is active as hell on places like The Sims Resource or even Twitter and Tumblr, so make the most of it for your modding and/or objects and clothing needs. If you're not going to be taking part in any of that, though, for some reason... I'd refrain from playing this game at all. The Sims 4 is like sliced bread. You probably don't enjoy sliced bread by itself, or eat it very often, do you? It's plain, basic, and boring! The community provides some extra ingredients. If you won't be making a sandwich, you might as well not buy the plain-ass bread."

I broke down during the summer sale and bought the base game and several of the extras. I've been playing The Sims since its first version. When S4 came out I thought it might just be a money pit and stuck with S3, despite the many bugs 3 had. S3 had an awful lot of content.

I'm giving The Sims 4 a recommend, but barely. The first impression of it hasn't been as good as I'd hoped, and I'm still on the fence about cost/benefit. Here's a typical pro/con list after the first inning or so:

Some Pros:
- The graphics. By far the most beautiful of the Sims games and with a slightly better create-a-sim interface, although see Cons below. The in-game look is terrific, especially the lighting, and the different ""worlds,"" which are really just neighborhoods your sim visits, load faster than they did in 3. This is because each neighborhood is small. Instead of forty lots and properties in one place that have to be loaded, you have maybe 12 places to each neighborhood with more neighborhoods, and travel is fast. The energy in the game was very clearly channeled into making everything look great and to take you much faster to a place you want to visit.

- The more sophisticated mood manager. There's a state-of-mind thing in the game beyond the basic needs. You can be inspired, happy, energized, focused, and the total package of moods has its own benefits. Neat idea.

- Bigger, smoother group gatherings. Putting a group together in the Sims 3 was always an iffy, glitchy, chaotic affair. S4 has a much better party function, including the Get Together expansion that has clubs you can join. Dancing is hilarious.

- Great expansion ideas, particularly having to do with environmental responsibility (but, there are too many expansions with too little content added to each one, so we're back to the money pit).

- Lots have a vibe to them. You can choose mood characteristics for a lot just as you do for a sim, so a lot can boost a sim's progress in certain pursuits.

- Cute little kids and pets (with an expansion) who show natural behaviors that are often funny and adorable.

- A few convenient streamlining decisions. Your sim doesn't have to wash every dish in the house anymore, for instance, although it's weird to have god (you) just pick up a dirty plate and ghost it into the trash can in a game all about chores and self care.

Pro/Con:

- The new content has some fun little surprises that weren't in S3, but these are often pros with cons attached. The objects in the new version have some neat interactions, although some of them simply don't do what they advertise. Patchy the Scarecrow, for instance, hangs out and watches TV--creepy--more often than doing anything in the garden. If you don't want a pal from a slasher movie then you want to keep him locked out of the house. When you hire a ""professional gardener"" the expensive contract worker stops by, waters a few plants, skips five other things that could be done, then charges you and goes home. But the bird feeder is fun.

- Too easy to botch a big decision. You need to be careful about how getting married works or it won't go as the interface implies with its vaguely-labeled choices. You might want to use YouTube or Twitch streams before you make any life-changing choices. I tend to micromanage my sims, so if you're fine to just watch the random behavior show and see what gets set on fire, then you'll like the autonomy on and the hold-my-beer nature of some of the commands.

I'm saying ""pro"" and writing ""con"" here. That sums up the Sims 4. You get nothing without paying for it in some way. My hope is that in time I'll just memorize which moments of programming stupidity I can get around.


Cons:

Some of these are pretty big. Gameplay in S3 was slow because of bugs. Gameplay in S4 is slow because your sims are simply dumber than bags of hammers.

- I don't know who decided that you can play the bejezus out of a piano but cannot for the life of you feed your toddler on less than four tries and two hours of wasted time, but the most basic element of The Sims since its invention has gotten a little lost--time management. You can't just pick up your toddler and walk downstairs with the kid. Oh, no. Takes hours unless you pick her up, indicate where you want to put her down, do that, then pick her up again to place her in the high chair, which may or may not happen, before you give her a bowl of generic food, which may be too confusing for your adult sim who understands music theory to accomplish in less than an hour. The kid in the game will likely be more patient with this than you are before she disintegrates into sadness and fills her pants because her other needs depleted while you were hammering away at meeting just the one.

A shower in this game can take all day. Sims stand in place or just do something else when you give them commands--that's with autonomy shut off. With it on they'll simply ignore what you want them to do. They collapse into instant mood meltdown because of a thunderstorm.

- There are tons of options for conversation, for things to buy, for things to do. And you will not be allowed to do them. Fascists designed this game. You have to reach level 10 of some profession to get an item. You have to be a comedian in order to become a musician. You have to figure out some puzzle sequence of interactions in order to achieve something that should be simple. If you like to cook and let your sims eat what they cook, they will be fat. You have to work out like the entire cast of Guardians of the Galaxy, including Rocket, in order to just keep the basic shape your sim had in create-a-sim for long stretches of that sim's life. Your wardrobe is still limited by function rather than just listing all the clothing and letting your sim wear what you want the sim to wear (without using cheats). The controlling nature of the design does not make the game ""more challenging"" unless you consider standing in a bread line with your government-issued ticket a fun challenge. You have to find your fun in a more zen way, just watching the neat stuff the game actually lets you do when the programming doesn't get in your way.

- You might like a game that works best only when you use certain cheats. I like a game that's programmed so you aren't constantly tempted to revert to cheats.

- You can't decide how long you want your sims to live. S3 had specific numbers of days you could set for stages of life. S4 just gives you ""short"" or ""long,"" and you have to squeeze in what is sometimes an unreachable goal into a life. S3 did some of this, too--the architect career track, for instance. Sadly, S4 didn't solve some time management problems from S3 in a time management game. I have read that you will likely never reach the top level of running a veterinary clinic before your sim dies, no matter how workaholic your sim is.

- S4 got rid of vehicles, which seems like another way to undercut The Sims rather than make it more... simmish. When you want to go to another neighborhood you just fade out and show up in some cloud of transcendental teleportation. There's a space ship. There isn't a junker for you to drive to work while you save up for the cool sportscar. Strange, and not cool.

- The price tag. It's hard to say you'll be getting what you want specifically from this game for less than $75 beyond the base game, even at the sale prices. Wait for the packs to go to at most $7.99 and wait for the game to age a little more so that the $40 expansions cost $25 or so.

- Origin. Does anyone like Origin? Is that possible? Origin is the capitalist goon element that EA never needed and that turns every experience into navigating a giant mall to find a restroom. When I load a game I want to play the game, not open the door to another Jehovah's Witness offering me another pamphlet. I paid my money, Origin. Get out of my interface."

First off, we all know giving money to Evil Arseholes is nearly as bad as giving money to ISIS... so let's say that you buy the base game of Sims 4 for $40... is it worth it, and can you enjoy the base game? Yeah, probably.

Now then... the game has over $800 worth of DLC (because Evil Arseholes), so is it worth it to pay $800 for all the DLCs? HELL to the NO. You can literally just use CreamAPI and unlock all of it gratis, plus you'd still have an intact soul afterwards.

Sims 4 is an incredibly good life-sim game, and should be proud. It's just a shame that chose to get in bed with this devil publisher, and then allowed the devil to backdoor them (and their games) for the past 20years+

Really good but difficult. It was hard after we competed it, getting the ball in the goal. I liked that I could play with dad, if it was 1, we wouldnt have played it because there is two of us."

Despite the gameplay taking around 3h in total, I have to admit that every single second of this game was well spent, and there were so many genuine moments I actually laughed out loud for once.

The game has a wonderful playfulness to it and I simply cannot describe how much I needed a game like this. I can imagine that I would place this game close to my heart at any age, too, and simply the silliness yet ingenuity of the gameplay is wonderful, as well as the amount of fleshing out the game has for how short it is.

If you feel like you want to relax, feel a little silly, and have a real fun time, I highly recommend Untitled Goose Game.

(Late Edit: Forgot to mention the music in this game adds so well to the playful atmosphere)"

Great game to play with your kid(s). It's a mischievous game full of ornery behavior, but it's all relatively harmless and simple fun. It's a nice change of pace for a game to have minor dubious objectives instead of being a destroyer of worlds. The music flows with the game depending on how you're interacting with the environment. It shifts between soft smooth pleasant classical music when you're exploring and then louder more scattery sounds when being chased.

All in all, it's my son's (5yo) favorite game, and he's already put dozens and dozens of hours into it. Incidentally he's now getting into speedrunning and has even gotten the ""Garden Quickly"" achievement which I think is pretty impressive for a 5 year old."

There are likely support groups for those personally victimised by geese out in the real world but with recent events, the ever-present threat of vicious waterfowl has all but fallen out of public consciousness. Untitled Goose Game is one of those rare golden eggs which crop up from time to time and gives the player the opportunity to fashion a feathery comeback.

For those who have been sleeping under a rock for the past year, Untitled Goose Game gleefully burst onto the scene in September 2019 after a year of social media hype, with a PS4 and Xbox One release later in December. Initially an Epic store exclusive, Steam users are finally able to get their beaks into it as the release coincides with a nifty little local multiplayer update, but more on that later.

The concept is simple, you are a horrible little goose out to terrorise a quaint British village in as many ways as possible. From the relatively simple act of dumping gardening tools into the local pond, to the complete victimisation of a particularly nervous and bespectacled young idiot, there are countless opportunities to cause mischief. A to-do list provides some necessary direction and completing tasks on the list allows progression through the linear level system, unlocking new areas to go and cause trouble in. And as far as gameplay goes, Untitled Goose Game is pretty straightforward. Your orange and white feathered menace has their versatile beak and raspy honk to use whatever objects can be found lying around, in order to achieve as much mayhem as possible. Sending villagers on —quite literally— a wild goose chase. Thinking outside of the box will often tick off secret objectives and unlock achievements, of which there are plenty.

The graphics are simple, but that all adds to its charm. The most amazing thing about this game is in the detail. From the sounds your evil avian makes as he flip-flops his way across different surfaces, to the echoes that honk back at you from a well. The attention to the small things makes this game feel polished and solid. That’s not to say there aren’t small glitches, which is to be expected from a physics puzzle game, but they aren’t intrusive and end up being a barely noticeable hiccup in what would otherwise be an excellently developed game. The soundtrack is simple yet masterfully scored, making use of classical piano compositions from Debussy which dynamically change in mood and pace depending on the situation. It unobtrusively sits in the background providing flourish and support to the rest of the game.

With the latest update, the game takes on the moniker of Untitled Geese Game allowing a second player to get in on the action locally. This opens up a ton of opportunity for collaborative scheming, and when working together seems too friendly, you can always make things difficult for your partner. You are, after all, a feathery menace to society. As an added bonus, the Steam version supports Remote Play Together, removing the requirement to be sat next to your player two.

From the first to the last, House House have packed a ton of fun into a relatively lightweight game. The price of £15 may send some gamers into a bit of a flap as Untitled Goose Game sits in the higher price bracket for a year-old casual game, but the current introductory discount reduces it to just £11 which is more than reasonable. That said, this reviewer originally bought the game on the Switch last year and loved every second and having just purchased the Steam version, remote play with distant family is now possible. A welcome distraction in the current climate for little more than the cost of a couple of coffees.

Overall, this game is definitely worth a gander. Because after all, who wouldn’t want to be a horrible little goose? 🦢"

♦️ Untitled Goose Game
Untitled Goose Game is an entertaining game that revolves around a goose terrorizing innocent civilians. Every couple years we get an indie gem like Goose Game that completely blows up out of nowhere, and I look forward to finding the next! It is a short experience that prioritizes player experimentation and never outstayed its welcome. This will be a shorter review as the game is short and relatively simple in itself, short and sweet (Just like a real goose).

Gameplay
→ The gameplay itself is not the most innovative, but that is not the focal point to begin with. It can be simplified as picking up items, interacting with items, moving the goose around, and of course honking. Through your short playthrough of Untitled Goose Game you will be set in five unique areas that all have their own secrets for you to discover.

→ Once you’re set loose in these areas you will have a sort of ‘to-do list’ to complete. While that may sound like you’re going through the motions and just doing whatever the game is telling you to do, that is not the case. The game will set these absurd tasks like “having a picnic” or “lock the shopkeeper in the garage”. And the fun is not being told what to do, the fun is finding out how you are supposed to go about completing these tasks. This topic flows perfectly into the next section, that is the beauty of player experimentation and how well it is done in Untitled Goose Game.


→ This is what makes Untitled Goose Game the gem that it is, the exploration and experimenting to see what outcome you get is an exciting time. You have you the goose and all the perks that come with being a goose (honk!), with that and the environment you are set on a mission of terror. The world here really is your oyster, given a list of vague objectives you are tasked about how you can get these scenarios to occur.

→ The situations that occur are charming and unique, no two objectives are the same. This is really the main attribute that makes Untitled Goose Game worthy of a purchase. The game is essentially one big puzzle, and you must help the goose unravel these problems.


→ The visuals in this game are stylized and further enhance the ‘indie charm’ that is already so prevalent all throughout Untitled Goose Game. Instead of going for hyper-realistic goose 4k textures we get this beautifully cel-shaded art direction. The environments here are like the cartoons you used to watch as a child and being paired by playing as a goose, it does it’s best to bring your inner child.

→ The sound direction perfectly compliments almost every aspect in Untitled Goose Game. The gameplay is wacky and cartoony, the art style is charming and cute, and is all tied together by the soundtrack. When you are exploring the town and not up to mischief the music that plays is delightful and happy, when up to no good the soundtrack quickly follows your lead and plays more intense sounds.

→ Another welcoming surprise is how well the sounds of the environment are. Everything from a retail store door chime to a water sprinkler all have their own appropriate sounds. This really enhances the world to the next level, as interacting with the environment is a major facet in this game.


In conclusion Untitled Goose Game is a game that is perfect to play and forget about the stresses of the real world. The game offers a one of a kind experience of playing as a goose with only one thing on his mind, misbehavior. While Untitled Goose Game is an exciting and unique twist on the typical formula games feed us, I am not sure if it is a must play. The content provided is fun on its own, but what you get isn’t really worth full price. I heavily recommend that if you have interest in this game to pick it up on sale to live out your fantasies of being a goose."

I bought this for my kids and they love the heck out of this game, as you can see by the current 345 hours total it has been played thus far. They're always laughing and they love to play this game together, its really helped them with their controls since one plays with keyboard and one plays with an Xbox controller.
Even though they have both mainly moved on to Minecraft nowadays, this is still a game they come back to every so often."

When first advertised, I almost felt as though that Untitled Goose Game was just a Goat Simulator clone. Due to the Summer 2022 Steam Sale however, I got to give it more of a look before buying it. I decided to buy it and give it a whirl. The premise of the game is to complete a To-do list to get from one stage to the next. The To-do list involves puzzles being completed by way of gathering props and being a nuisance for the humans in each stage. In short, the gameplay is highly cathartic in a nonviolent way.

Aside from the wonderfully fun and cathartic gameplay, I was most impressed with the sound track of the game while you play. It will only play at certain moments and only if the humans notice you and chase after you. For reference it sort of reminded me of the pianist expressions heard while watching the ""Land of Make-Believe"" sequence of ""Mr Rodger's Neighborhood"". Needless to say it adds a very charming personality to the game."

Things I Like About Untitled Goose Game:

1. I too, want to become a menace to the society over a church bell sometimes.

2. ""The Rake Is Indeed In The Lake"""
untitled+goose+game,Recommended,4.1,"Posted: January 23
Untitled Goose Game is a stealth puzzle game where you play as a goose whose mission in life is to be an absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.

The controls are simple: you can honk, flap your wings, and pick stuff up with your beak. Instead of being open-ended, the game gives you a ""to-do list""; most of the game is trying to figure out how to stealthily accomplish each of these tasks. The tasks are rather varied and take some critical thinking to parse out exactly what the game wants you to do.

All in all, there are 4 areas which cumulate to roughly 2-3 hours of mainline content. After you reach the credits, extra tasks will be added to the to-do list, which bump up the playtime another couple hours, if you're willing to take them on. Most of the endgame content is pretty bland by comparison (5 of the tasks are to ""speedrun"" the original tasklist, which I found pretty easy and repetitive), so the main game is where most of the fun is at. I didn't find the playtime to be objectionable, like other reviewers did; a simple comedy game like this doesn't need to overstay its welcome. Having said that, if you're a gamer on a budget who wants something deep and involved for your money, well frankly, I don't know why you're looking at a freaking goose game homie.

The game doesn't control well with a mouse + keyboard, so a gamepad is highly recommended. Not a big deal, but this can be annoying in multiplayer if you've only got one controller and want to use keyboard for your other player.

The minimalist art fits the premise quite well. It uses classical music (Claude Debussy) for all of its music, and though in some ways I felt like that was ""an easy way out"" compared to making an original soundtrack, I can't deny that it fit here nicely.

Truth be told, there's not much I can be critical about with this one. I got a few chuckles out of it, the premise never got old, and I left feeling pretty satisfied with what it gave me. I was thoroughly entertained, even if it's not the type of game that will stay in my memory for very long. Just a bit of silly fun as a goose."

A short and sweet lil' adventure. Def contender for greatest game title ever.

I'd imagine this would be a great title to play with family (especially family members who aren't really into gaming.)

Clean and crisp graphics and overall game play, no crashes or setup nonsense.

Objectives are just the right amount of difficult for what is supposed to be a low key, relaxing game with a renegade goose for a main protagonist.

Standard price is high for a game with minimal replay value, but the rare sales are well worth it for sure.

Overall a fun time that can be enjoyed by all :)

HONK / 10

Had a ton of fun watching the bf play it. Had even more fun actually playing it. Gonna try it out with couch co-op, which I'm sure will be even more fun (and definitely a lot more chaotic).

You basically play as a goose who goes to different parts of a town, like a park, a pub, some houses, doing typical goose things like...uh- making people trip, stealing their stuff, having your own picnic and of course, .
I mean, there's a dedicated honk button. Just honking at people, watching them get hella surprised or scared is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hilarious. . There's a to-do list which gives you all the objectives that you need to complete to progress through each area, but because it's a sandbox game, there are various ways to do these tasks. It's not like you only have to stick to the tasks given either. The whole point is that you cause as much mayhem as you can and have fun doing it.

Game's pretty short. First run's gonna take you about 2-4 hours depending on how you play and it's best played without taking breaks. The level transition is pretty smooth and feels organic. It doesn't get stale or boring at any point and is constantly engaging you. Plus, after you finish the game, it gives you extra things that you can do, to make your run...even more chaotic (plus, some speedrun type quests, to increase the challenge).

Untitled Goose Poem

The game is not about some duck
It is done well, it does not suck
But is you want a game to choose
You might decide to play this goose

You got some people to annoy
And chase around the frightened boy
You have to fill your to-do list
They shoo away, but you insist

These people do not understand
You do not break, you just amend
Their lives are full of useless things
You fix that flaw with open wings

They need to hear the righteous voice
To honk or not, it is your choice
It does not suck, it is done well
So play some goose and ring the bell"

This game is a delight! It's fun to harass the humans and figure out how to do the things on your checklist. The goose controls / behavior are perfect. A lot of work went into the controls and animations for the goose, and you can tell. It is very satisfying to just goose around in the world. My young kids love watching it, too! The only realistic complaint I could see is that it is short, perhaps 3-4 hours for the initial lists, and maybe another 3-5 for the extra items. It feels appropriate for the concept, though. Any more levels and I think it would have lost something or been stretched too thin. I would definitely play a DLC, though! 10/10 would honk again."

I’m a game developer and I’m overwhelmed with how toxic the industry has become in the last 10 years due to greed and venture capital. Games have transformed from actual toys to play and have fun to machines for juicing and parasiting on users’ addictions and cravings.

In that context of our society, Dave The Diver is an amazing relief and gives me back my inner child passion to get back to making videogames that really are fun to play, to make an art form with love, to make content just for the sake of telling a good interactive story, to give a nice moment to people.

This game is a 10/10. It never stops giving you new content and new core mechanics even in the late game. The game has lots of minigames to solve, and when you thought you’ve seen and perfected all the core mechanics, suddenly a new map, town, or challenge is unlocked with completely new mechanics to learn and master. It doesn’t recycle too much, it doesn’t take the easy path, its development demonstrates what is really possible when you make something with love and real effort and not just for an easy cash grab.

I want more games like this. I want to make games like this. Not a single lootbox in sight. Not a single child becoming a gambler as an adult."

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
The trailers do a good job of explaining what the core gameplay loop will be. Dive into the ocean collecting fish, turn that fish into sushi to use at the restaurant where customers pay you money, turn the money into upgrades, go back to diving with better gear, rinse and repeat.

What may not come across quite as strongly is how well paced and soothing everything is. Diving around for fish does have moments of punctuated panic where you're trying to expertly dodge sharks, or land shots with your harpoon gun to reel in that particularly agile fish you've been hunting; but the vast majority of the time is simply exploring the ever-changing cove and gently floating alongside the local marine life.

The jumps between the panic and the breezy bits is really well done. The restaurant management makes for a nice change of pace between your dives and the additional layers that come later (I'll refrain from mentioning the other things you'll visit/ manage later in the game) mean that even after 16 hours; I was still finding new directions that the game would go in.

There's not a lot more to say than that. The animations are delightful, the characters and the dialogue is funny, and the gameplay hits the note between panic and relaxation really well. I'd heartily recommend Dave the Diver and I'm looking forward to where else this game goes once it's out of early access."

""Just one more dive...""

I bought this game completely on a whim because I kept seeing it advertised everywhere and saw all the glowing reviews. I went in blind, not knowing much besides ""catch fish during day, sell them at night."" I was expecting something with a very simple concept like Moonlighter but I was pleased to see it's much more than that and there's a lot to unpack here and so much to enjoy. There's a lot I personally love about the game.


- The addictive gameplay of filling out essentially a fish pokedex (like animal crossing)

- The satisfying loop of catching a bunch of fish, selling them at the restaurant you manage, and using the money to upgrade Dave's diving equipment so you can progress further, deal more damage, upgrade oxygen tank, etc.

- Wonderful soundtrack. It's got tense scores during boss fights to just more relaxing chill music while on a peaceful dive, and I'm someone who almost never pays attention to the soundtrack in games.

- Even many hours in I was pleased to still be unlocking new content (for example, a farm to grow more crops for your dishes)

- Some of the random minigames are so much fun. I wasn't expecting to suddenly have to play a rhythm minigame sequence as Duff, the anime loving neckbeard who provides Dave with weapon upgrades, but it gave me a good laugh and just shook up the gameplay a bit.

- All the characters are so charming, even smaller characters are so fleshed out, such as a rapper named MC Sammy who has a popular song called ""Hot Pepper Tuna""


This is one of those games where it's very clear where all the hype comes from once you play it. I can't recommend it enough."

It's not too hard, it's fun and it's addictive. O! And it made me laugh out loud several times because of the characters and the story. It's over the top. Beside all of that the diving is very relaxing and the game doesn't hurry you up so you can make sushi and sell it at your own tempo and upgrade your stuff before you want to go deeper into the story. The upgrades are great and realy help you along deeper/diving into the game. Yep, Dave hit several of my game spots. I really like Sushi by the way."

Product received for free

Dave the Diver is an extremely diverse, distinctive, and captivating adventure RPG. It does not stick to a specific genre and has constant surprises for players. I have never played anything even remotely similar and am blown away at the amount of interesting concepts jumbled masterfully together to create the memorable experience that is, Dave the Diver. This astonishing Indie is well deserving of its “overwhelmingly positive” rating here on Steam and I am ecstatic to see it rightfully receiving its success and well-deserved recognition.

Pros
Constant new content to learn & discover that regularly evolves
Extremely addictive & distinctive gameplay loop







You play as Dave, and you guessed it, he is a diver. Dave begins diving in the “blue hole” which is a marine biological hotspot that provides habitat to a diverse range of aquatic life. Dave dives and collects marine life to be used in the accompanying sushi shop. Dave soon finds himself entangled in the mystery of a long-forgotten “sea people” civilisation and will use his diving skills to discover more about them and help various other characters along the way.

Whilst there is a strong narrative in the game, the characters are all so lovingly wacky. From the Anime-girl-obsessed-gun-making nerd, to the stoic sushi chef, or the vegetable loving rapper. Despite the crazy characters, there are fantastic foundations for each of them and I adored them all.



As aforementioned, I have never played a game with as much variation as Dave the Diver, but I will attempt to explain the core gameplay. During the day, Dave is able to dive into the ocean, explore it, collect fish via various methods, pick up objects, complete quests etc. At night, the sushi bar opens and he will help serve there. This means typical Cooking Dash style gameplay, running around clicking on food and taking it to the customer and serving drinks. Have to be quick though, as customers do not have high patience levels. Dave will earn money after each sushi serving shift and this can then be used on upgrades and many other things. The games pacing is absolutely fantastic despite the enormous amount of extra content that gets added later, things are introduced slowly and are generally easy to understand. Perhaps the biggest downfall about this game is the lie I would tell myself after playing until the early hours of the morning, saying “one more dive, then I will go to bed.” Definitely not.


In the beginning, Dave can only dive to limited depths and has restricted cargo capacity. These will increase as different elements are upgraded such as oxygen tank capacity etc. Dave can hunt fish via a variety of methods, using a harpoon to manually pull fish in, or various guns and tools. Everything can be upgraded and there are also different types that can be added such as incendiary, poison or tranquiliser. Bigger fish such as sharks require more effort and stronger guns, and sometimes quick time events will trigger where a button must be mashed to pull in a fish. While diving, Dave must be careful of his oxygen levels as if it runs out, he will need to be rescued resulting in everything in his inventory being lost except 1 item. Oxygen also acts as his health, and if hurt by other fishes or the environment, his oxygen levels will quickly deplete. There are lots of goodies to be found in exploration that can be used in crafting and also includes plenty of oxygen spots to refuel. As the game progresses, players will have access to further locations such as glacier waters, caves and of course, the deep sea. Each area has unique fish to be discovered, with over 200 to find in total.





There is a decent amount of combat in the game, including many boss fights. The boss fights are all exceptionally different and vary in difficulty. As said earlier, guns can be crafted and upgraded to help in the battles. Specific fish will also automatically target Dave if he gets close and these first encounters can actually be quite scary, specifically with the large sharks!



Further to the basic Cooking Dash style mechanics, the menu must be selected daily based off the fish Dave brings back from his adventures. Recipes must be researched, additional staff can be hired, décor can be purchased and later in the game, even a second branch of the shop can be opened and managed. Each dish is priced differently, usually depending on rarity and can be upgraded with special items to increase its value and “tastiness”. This variation from diving to serving was absolutely phenomenal and kept me addicted from the get-go.


I cannot possibly describe everything in this game as there is just too much, and it constantly switches genre. However, some of the highlights include having a fish farm, VIP visits, cooking competitions, rhythm mini games, managing a vegetable farm, side quests, taking photos of wildlife, chase sequences, puzzles, unique segments controlling two characters at once, riding a beluga whale, tranquilising large sharks and using a drone to transport them back to the fish farm and so, so much more. The game can easily be continued after completing the story and there is enough in management style mechanics to keep you busy for hundreds of hours. From collecting all of the fish, to running a successful fish and vegetable farm, to operating and managing your sushi employees and second branch. No two dives are the same.



Dave the Diver is visually stunning, utilising a combination of pixel art with 2D/3D art to create a beautiful oceanic environment brimming with aquatic life. Seeing whales, turtles and manta rays created a sense of awe within me. A testament to the efficacy of the gorgeous environment.



The soundtrack is casual yet addictive, giving a laidback beach vibe, but ramping up the stress during fast-paced sequences. Characters are not voiced, but speak in a robotic monotone voice that at first I didn’t like, but it grew on me shortly after.









22-25 hours to complete the story. 50+ hours for completionists, or plenty of additional content to enjoy after finishing the game.

Player choice

Dave the Diver is an experience that I will hardly forget and is well deserving of its many accolades. It is almost unbelievable that developers managed to pack this much content into one Indie game and make it not only coherent, but brilliant. From a quirky story, an extremely addictive gameplay loop to new engaging mechanics introduced throughout the entirety of the game, there is an abundance to love and I highly recommend it at its bargain full price cost of only $AU29.99."

Dave the Diver is A LOT of things and it's not shocking how all the reviews are OVERWHELMINGLY positive.

You hunt and photograph fish, farm fish and food, unravel mysteries deep underwater, and help run a sushi restaurant. While it all sounds like a lot, it honestly is pretty well balanced. I was surprised just how much content was in the game, especially with it being a $20 indie game.

The basis of the game and the controls were very simple to understand, yet the game still had a lot of depth to it. The music was amazing and complemented the gameplay really well. The visuals and graphics were full of detail and looked beautiful even for being a pixel-like style.

The characters and the cut-scenes are THE BEST PART in my opinion. From an anime-obsessed gun maker to cooking competitions between chefs, the cut-scenes are just *chefs kiss.* I took so many screenshots because of dumb, funny, or cool visuals.

There was also an assortment of boss fights and underwater puzzles that kept the game interesting. There are a ton of different weapons to craft and also a bunch of unique weapons you can find while exploring!
I cannot stress enough just how much stuff is packed into this little game.

Few small things I didn't like:
- The mouse icon isn't at all themed towards the game. While this sounds like something so minimal (and it is tbh), it sticks out like a sore thumb compared to all of the amazing art and details that the game has.
- There weren't a lot of graphic settings. I kept getting some tearing and unfortunately, there was no vsync option. You can basically only change the resolution. Not a huge deal but having options is always nice.
- For how much content is in the game, it can feel a bit repetitive at times. It's a constant gameplay loop of checking all your farms, diving, running the restaurant, etc that eventually gave me burnout but that may have just been because I was 100%ing the game.

It probably took me around 30hrs to beat and 57hrs to 100%.

I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes adventure and restaurant management games/sims. It's a great game to just relax and chill out on."

This game got me through a really dark place in my life. I lost my job, spouse, and home in less than a year. I would chop wood and fish when I couldn't find the energy to do anything else and fall asleep on the couch listening to the background music. But when I played Dave the Diver first time, my whole life changed. The little successes I had were the catalyst I needed to think maybe I could have little successes again in life, too. Highly recommend. Thank you for making this game."

After 40 hours, and 100% completing this early access game, I can say that it's one of the most fun I've played. I keep playing even though there is nothing left to do, and there is no more fish to catch because it is still enjoyable after. My life feels so meaningless now, I eat sushi in the darkness and play the same overpriced FPS in hopes that the full game releases soon.

Im 5.5 hours in so far and this game is really great! The art style is fantastic, the cut scenes have an afro samurai vibe which looks incredible. The game play is well balanced with a great mix of mini games and story quests which break up the main gameplay of supplying the sushi restaurant with fresh fish. The story has me hooked (ha). The game feels very polished and finished despite it just releasing in early access which is refreshing compared to other early access games on steam. My only complaint is I wish the game had ultra wide support. But that is a very very minor complaint."

You may think this game is just diving, catching fish and running a sushi restaurant but its not. Its so much more than that. Its an EXPERIENCE with surprises around every corner. This game combines different elements that somehow seamlessly fit and makes sense.

Its management, fun storytelling, satisfying & addictive gameplay, boss battles, collecting, mini-games, upgrading, exploration, relaxing & sometimes terrifying combat. Not to mention the stunning combination of 2D & 3D pixel art.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
This is a very cute, addictive, and stylish game with a lot of potential. My only complaint is that progression in this game seemed too quick for a restaurant management game. With the gameplay loop being as satisfying as it is, I think the game would benefit from slower progression, allowing the players to just relax, explore, and enjoy their time working towards the growth of their restaurant. Slowing the progression of the game down, coupled with enhancements to the procedural generation of the game so that it feels more varied on each dive, I would very much like to see.

Overall, this game has a lot of potential. I fell in love with the gameplay, design, music, and style. I just wish that progression was slower so that I could spend more time just diving, cooking, and managing my business."

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
This is a fun little game about diving in the ocean, exploring the depths, then savagely murdering every creature in sight as a sacrifice to the gods of capitalism.

The atmosphere is quite nice, characters and creatures are done in a pretty good looking pixel art format, the soundtrack is quite pleasant and generally fits the themes and moods. There’s plenty of little mini games, events and gameplay variety to keep things fresh beyond the loop of ‘jump in, kill fish, make money’ and overall I found the game engaging all the way through until the end of the early access chapters. Just about every cutscene is worth watching at least once - they’re incredibly stylish and good for a chuckle.

The game makes a big deal about using procgen environments and that “every dive is different” but I honestly didn’t see much of that. Creature spawns are more or less static and the areas themselves rarely change their layout beyond small, superficial things. It doesn’t really take away much from the gameplay loop itself, and I probably wouldn’t have even thought about it if the game didn’t make such a big show about calling it out in the first place.

My biggest complaint is the controls. They’re quite clunky, to the point that I’d say the #1 cause of dying for the time I played this was due to some kind of control mishap. It baffles me a bit that in a game about being underwater and more or less free from the idea of gravity that your aim is locked in to +/- 45 degrees horizontally with no way to aim any higher or lower without awkwardly repositioning poor Dave in the midst of having his butt chomped off by an angry shark. The choice to require a button press to begin aiming the weapon with a totally separate button to actually fire, neither of which is terribly responsive, can be equally frustrating in more dangerous moments.

Adding to that frustration is dying during a boss fight/event section commits the mortal sin of making you rewatch all the unskippable cutscenes/intros every single time you restart it - please, a skip button. I beg you.

I do hope the world generation and control issues get polished up before the game releases, but even if they don’t this is still worth a play if you’re in to the vaguely roguelite gameplay loop and exploration stuff."

I started this game at 7pm and stopped playing, only because adulting dictated i needed to, at 3.45am. i was having a blast! each time i was like ok ill complete this and then do go to bed, but a special event happened, or i got a new upgrade. there is SO MUCH CONTENT for early access. how much will there be for the whole game?! if its any indication, its got to be a big game. im really looking forward to playing more, and for the full release. hopefully our progress will be saved and added with full release, but honestly if not, im game to replay! as far as the graphics and game play, i did run into 2 issues. only 2 bugs for an early release is damn good! bringing your phone out will sometimes cause a red and black screen, ive had that happen 3 times in almost 9 hours of game play. i started the dive and my character never showed up in the ocean. that happened once. so 4 bugs in 9 hours for early access is amazing! also, for those who are a fan of Food Wars, it does have some vibes with the vips. thats all ill say.

DAVE THE DIVER

... one more dive and it´s 2 a.m.


The game in a nutshell

DAVE THE DIVER is a pixel-art management action-adventure. Dive by day and run a sushi bar in the evening. Apart from managing your staff, enobling your interior, collecting ingredients and obviously hunting fish for your menu card (which you change daily depending on your hunting success) this game offers much more, but I´ll try to keep it as spoiler-free as possible - it needs to be experienced. The gameplay loop though is highly addictive and once you think you´ve seen it all the game surprises you with another possibility to expand your business, another activity as e.g. mini games or one of its genious and charming cutscenes that introduce the next story or continue a previous.



+ beautifully designed - the art style, atmosphere and music/sounds are great and perfectly underline the game´s mood
+ explore the ocean and decide what it´ll be on today´s menu
+ lovable characters with amusing interactions
+ hilarious cutscenes and humor in general
+ many pop culture references
+ manage your to-do´s, crafting, social media and more with apps on your ingame cellphone
+ time events that are always managable
+ very polished for an EA game
+ as mentioned the gameplay loop is highly addictive - 18 hours in three days says it all
+ several storylines, all of which intertwine beautifully
+ end bosses for some of the quests and stories
+ easy 100% for those who care about achievements


+/- although the game uses procedurally generated environments, most of the areas repeat themselves - I hope that this feature will be strengthened in future updates for more variety during the dives


- the only negative for me is the QTE parts that appear when you try catching some of the high tier fish, but that depends on and minimizes when you get better gear. The reason behind is just a skill issue - as an older gamer my reflexes are in a downward spiral and I totally suck at QTE...



Although it´s just January 2023 this already is personal GOTY material and there is a reason for the overwhelmingly positive rewievs it has. DAVE THE DIVER still is in Early Access and I´m thrilled for its upcoming content. And since we´re talking about a food related game I´d like to mention that a good meal, and in this case the game itself, is the outcome of the right mix of ingredients, passion and invested love for every step of the work. And that you can feel in every single corner of the game, the attention to detail is truly amazing. This game is so good and entertaining that time really runs and I had to force myself to go to bed. Highly recommended if you´re looking for something unique that already is a masterpiece in its current EA state!"

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
What is this?! One of the best games I have played. Don't let the pixel graphics fool you, this game has a lot of gameplay elements and story in it.
You are a diver during the day and have to explore the sea to catch fish, find treasure and react to any sudden situations. You basically have an Oxygen meter to determine how long you can stay under the sea. It is also your HP meter, if you are hurt, you will lose some oxygen. When you are out of air, you will be saved and taken back to your ship but you can only retrieve one item.
For any fish or sea creature you caught, you sent to your restaurant for it to open for the night. You have a restaurant management mini game which you have to design the menu (from what you caught in the morning or from previous day's leftover), manage your staff, and serve your customers. Repeat the next day. The good thing about this game is that there are alot of side missions and quests for you to tend to during your undersea adventure. I won't get into too much detail here but there are still new stuff unlocking after 10 hours of play time.

Anyways here is a quick summary of pros and cons of this game:
Pros:
+ Lots of gameplay elements
+ Multiple storylines
+ Loveable characters and main protagonist
+ Relaxing but occasionally gives you a sense of danger and make you fight for your life.

Cons:
- Some Quality of life changes needed...
e.g.1. the drink pouring minigame continues for like 5 seconds even after you finished pouring and locks you out from doing other stuff... and if you don't entertain them they get angry and leaves...

e.g.2. no game loading unless you go back to the main menu, you either make it entirely impossible to load, or you allow us to easily load please)

e.g.3. claims the map is randomly generated but there are only a few variations with the same layout, so you will get familiar with them over time.
- FULL GAME HAS RELEASED!


Update after beating the full release:

So it has been a few months and I have put in 30 more hours to complete the game. This game still holds and manage to give me enjoyment from start to end, makes me wanting for more. Though, I can say there are two different meaning of completion with this game. Most people would end it after clearing the main story and probably after getting all achievements. This requires around 30-40 hours. I had a bug so I had to go and replay parts of the game again for one final achievement. And then there are the 100% completion crew. To get 100% completion (e.g. all dishes/staff/weapons upgraded), I can see you will probably need another 30-40 hours. The gap in between finishing the game and 100% the game is colossal. I would love to 100% the game normally but the great effort required made me gave it up. I am sure some people would love this and the game company actually gave you a choice by not forcing any achievements on that is great. Just make sure you note this.

Some notes worth mentioning:
+ Released some other QoL changes that removes the button mashing from the game. This wasn't a problem in my original review because I was playing with mouse and keyboard at first. During full game I tried playing with a controller and that was where the problem comes in. But the devs listened to the community and added accessibility options to simply have you hold the buttons so finally no more button mashing!

- Upgrade cost for staff for the final 5 levels are crazy. Materials required for the final few levels of dish upgrades are also crazy. In general the climb is very steep near the end for each staff/dish upgrade (while the return on investment is the same as before).

- Occasional bugs still exist (normal but still happened too often and had to mention) or not unlocking achievements."

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
In ""Dave the Diver"" you play as Dave, who is not just a diver but also a manager/server at a restaurant, and a farmer of both plants and fish. The core game play loop is Dave diving to collect fish and managing your restaurants menu. Within the game you'll also explore the depths of the (as of current two) ocean maps, complete various quests given to you by a host of unique and fun characters, manage your restaurant by hiring/training staff, and overseeing your fish/rice farm.

The game starts you exploring a small portion of a what it calls a constant changing pocket of the ocean (again only two maps as of now) wherein after learning the controls you'll become a server in the restaurant slowly opening up more game play as you progress.

Things done well in my opinion:
- The core game play loop is enjoyable
- There's a lot to do in the game
- The NPS are silly, entertaining, and the dialog is fairly well written
- Animations are over the top and a joy to watch (skippable after repeated viewings)
- The oxygen as health bar mechanic adds a nice level of tension to the game

What needs work in my opinion:
- There's a delay in trying to rapid fire your speargun that's annoying and makes fighting fast moving fish annoying
- It has the ""Mario"" mechanic where simply touching an enemy damages you, when fighting larger fish this can be very annoying as the tail or fins will destroy you in close combat
- Fish can get inside your hit box wherein you're unable to repel them. If you're heavy this can outright kill you as you're unable to escape
- It would be nice to be able to change the music around and ""Set"" it to different locations. As it is now, you can listen to any of the music you unlocked in the game on your phone but that's all you can do with it.

Overall ""Dave the Diver"" is quite a fun game and I would recommend it to others."

You might say to yourself - How can I possibly lose dozens of hours in a game revolving around running a Sushi restaurant? And for under $20?

I can't stress enough how incredible this game is. I ran out of positive adjectives to say about this game due to me trying to express my profound love for what exists. It's like climbing up your favorite hill, only to realize it's a mountain. But not only is it a mountain, but the largest mountain on earth - only to reveal that it's bigger than that. The audacity of this game to be this good, and so surprising and refreshing for so long borders on illegal.

This game is everything you expect and then tons and tons of things you don't expect - ALL of them fantastic and capable of being their OWN game. Hours into this immersive game, more and more things are being unlocked. Every random tangent you swim on or cook leads you down a rabbit hole of other tangents and unlocks.

This is my game of the year and slowly creeping its way into my game of the last 5 years. You will lose mountains of time.

This is the single best rougelite I've ever played and it's not even close. Dave the diver combines the beauty of some of the most relaxing game play with beautiful visuals, incredibly funny dialogue and characters, and so so so much side content that I've unironically spent more time doing that than I have progressing the main story, you can beat this game in roughly 12 ish hours if you were just pushing for main story objectives, but the insane amount of side content and extra achievements and optional content INCLUDING optional boss fights will easily have you playing for 35-40 hours minimum. The games two main gameplay loops of diving for fish and working at the sushi resturant perfectly go hand in hand, and the more you play the game, the more you'll actually WANT to just be swimming around underneath the ocean doing basically nothing but catching wildlife, fighting sharks, helping people with sidequests, theres just an absurd amount of content here, this game could be 150% of hell even 200% of its current price on steam and I'd still say it's worth it, this is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ gem of a game and you're seriously missing out if you aren't playing it."

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
I really want to like the game because it is a ton of fun besides one aspect. What is ruining my experience as an older gamer/developer with karpal-tunnel issues are the button mashing controls needed in many aspects of the gameplay. It is ruining my peripheral inputs, that is also why I stopped playing it on the steam deck. I do not think having to mash space-bar, left-mouse, or a button input 20 times in a five second interval is good for your hand and wrist health.

I wish the developers would change their approach and instead like they do it on some harpoons require a key sequence to be entered, aka W, A, space-bar e.g. Maybe give an option in the settings to activate sequential input mode, so people can decide between button mashing or a less hardware and wrist/hand-straining input method.

I will gladly change my review once this has been addressed or changed, for now I do not recommend this game for anyone who is concerned about their peripheral health or has issues mashing the same input over and over in a short burst.

EDIT: Well, seems like we got heard and the devs are addressing the button-mashing issues. So I will gladly change my review to recommend the game! Thanks for listening to the feedback and solving the issue devs! :)"

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
(Excuse my grammar mistakes in advance, English is not my first language)

Dave the Diver is a fun game with rogue-lite elements,
good playful music and a simple but cute story!
The game will keep you busy with these two main objectives:

> Run the sushi restaurant with the owner
> Explore and scavenge this 'mysterious' lake/sea near the restaurant (and catch food for the restaurant)

The game does a great job of alternating the tasks listed above. It keeps the game refreshing and light and makes me look forward to continue the progress that I've just made. It's also a great game for short bursts of playing as every task/section of the game takes about 10-20 minutes and you can just save and quit after any!

Dave the Diver is a relentlessly enjoyable experience. When I played the demo months ago, I could tell that it was something unique and fun, but I had no idea that the final product would be packed with so much content while also remaining cohesive and endearing throughout. Then, to top it all off, it has some of the most hilarious and well-made pixel art cutscenes I have ever encountered. You can stop here and just play it, but if you need more convincing, continue below.

Abbreviated Review:
YouTube™ Video: Dave the Diver Review - Sushi Saves the Sea 
Views: 1,046


The innocuous beginning of Dave the Diver makes it seem like you’re in for a run-of-the-mill management sim and side-scrolling ‘shooter’ of some sort. Your protagonist Dave is a seemingly mild-mannered and friendly guy who takes on any task presented to him with a smile. So, in addition to be-ing the sole diver hunting fish in the occasionally hostile environment of an island-encompassed blue hole, you’ll also be managing the menu, financials, décor, and being the primary server in the restaurant. The only thing you won’t be doing (mostly) is crafting the sushi itself – which is left to your mysterious hardnosed Chef Bancho.

Bancho, like many of the noteworthy characters in the game, has a small story that you get to explore within the gameplay. Character exploration is part of the larger narrative in what ultimately becomes a fairly expansive story with a lot of mysteries and discoveries within it. Like the blue hole itself, the adventure seems basic on the surface but is actually deep and full of secrets. While initially your goals are only stocking and running a restaurant, various characters will wander out to meet you on the dive platform of your small boat to request your assistance in several unique and iterative quest chains. Some of these chains weave into the core of the story while others are just extra tasks that can provide rewards and keep the game rich.

The money that you earn as a reward from some of these quests adds to your primary source of income – the restaurant. This money can be used for many tasks and resources including augmenting the restaurant as well as upgrading your gear to dive deeper, longer, and with better tools to keep you alive. The deeper you go, the more threats you’ll face, but you’ll also encounter rarer sea creatures that can be diced into more profitable dishes at the restaurant. However, that’s only a small portion of what you’ll find in the depths.

One interesting aspect of the journey through Dave the Diver is the process of unlocking the things you need to make it into new environments. You’ll, of course, need more air available as it’s not only for breathing but also functions as your health bar. Any time you’re stung by a jellyfish or snapped at by a shark, you’ll lose air – while also steadily losing it as you breathe. You can find barrels of that life-retaining substance randomly on the sea floor along with chests full of one-time-use resources like underwater scooters and temporary oxygen boosts. You’ll also find chests with new spear tips, guns, and melee weapons you’ll need to fend off and take down larger predators and prey.

Part of the unique challenge any time you dive into the ocean is that you have a sort of roguelike experience where you need to obtain stronger spears and weapons and the environment is slightly different. The undersea environment isn’t procedurally generated, so you will see the same map over several dives, but there are at least a handful of maps to navigate that change with the time of day. However, with the random nature of the items you obtain each time and the progressively more challenging creatures that appear as the story moves forward, it feels a lot more diverse than it is.

The chapter-based campaign is blocked out by the main quest line that uses key items to limit your overall progression. While you can upgrade your oxygen and suit to go deeper as well as your harpoon and weapons to fish more efficiently, even your first steps into deeper water require you to complete a quest for a headlamp. You can sit around avoiding the main quest to fish endlessly and run the restaurant, but the game is built around the excellent pacing that has you balancing that aspect with exploration and mystery quite well. Of the 25 hours it took me to finish the main part of the game, I made only a handful of dives that weren’t connected in some way toward progression.



Dave the Diver’s pacing works so well because it always gives you something new to do. The number of minigames and evolving mechanics is astounding. From the simplest tasks like having a different minigame for reeling in a big fish using each different spear tip to an immersive rhythm-based music challenge you can revisit at any time, you will never be complacent. It was almost overwhelming at times with how any given moment you could be using a mechanic you have never seen before to accomplish your next task. There are entire moments crafted in the game using controls and functionality that happen a single time, which almost seems wasteful if it wasn’t also fun as hell.

Between the minigames, boss fights, ever-expanding roles of spearfishing and restaurant management, and the hilarious cutscenes sprinkled throughout the game, I was blown away by everything presented. For a mere $20, this game provided one of the best experiences I’ve had in an indie game in a long time, and I am hoping that this isn’t the end of the adventure for Dave. The ongoing nature of serving new dishes in the restaurant and the potential to unlock more secret caves or deeper adventures leaves plenty of room for more content. However, even if somehow the developers don’t seize that opportunity, this game is well worth picking up and diving into."

I usually dislike fishing mini-games in other games, so I had my doubts when I saw that this one was ABOUT fishing. However, it was a pleasant surprise how much I enjoyed the game and how entertained I was while fishing. It never got tiring (well, except maybe taking care of the Tamagotchi, haha).

This is a fishing game with several other interesting mechanics. Surprisingly for me, it has a story, and quite an interesting one at that, with fantastic humor. Excellent pixel art, and let's not even get started on the music! This game has such great music; I can't get enough of it.

Basically, our main character, Dave, is invited to an exotic island to try some delicious sushi, but surprisingly, they actually want him to go diving... and, by the way, be a waiter/manager/farmer/fish breeder/card collector/photographer and researcher... among many other activities... Poor Dave, 24 hours a day are not enough.

I found all the mini-games very entertaining, except for the Tamagotchi, mostly because when I was a kid, I hated how much attention it demanded, and the minigame reminded me of that.

I think it's an excellent game to relax while doing some fishing, and if you like it get hooked on restaurant management. Lots of laughs with the cameos and references, as well as the game's overall sense humor; I had a blast, and I might even say I felt a bit sad when I finished it.

I don't know what the devs are planning if they have more content in mind for the game or a sequel, but I'm definitely looking forward to any news!

Highly recommended!"

The first several hours are fun, chill, and full of exploration and adventure as you go on the hunt, upgrade your gear, and plunge to new depths. Around the midgame, it turns into a series of endless dialogue cut scenes, fetch quests, mini-games, stealth missions, and even more of a micromanagement simulation.

I wish I could give this a neutral review, but it hit me that I was just no longer having fun. Certainly this will appeal to a certain kind of gamer, but it just wasn't me."

There hasn't been a game that's captivated me like this has in quite some time. I've put close to 12 hours in and think I'm near the end of the early access content but I keep being surprised by new mechanics that open up. There's a lot more to this game than initially meets the eye, and the mechanics are rolled out slowly enough that you feel like you have firm footing at every stage of the game.

So far, I truly can't find fault with this. The game just oozes character. The art and animations are superb. The music is great. The mechanics are actually pretty interesting and non-trivial (don't be turned off by the ""casual"" tag - there is definitely some challenge to both parts of the game). At the same time, they're not super stressful - the restaurant part of the game isn't a cakewalk (I rarely have a perfect night) but it's a far cry from something like Overcooked.

I haven't found myself genuinely smiling or laughing at a game like I have with this in a long time. To have that alongside genuinely interesting gameplay and all around good vibes is a treat. Definitely recommend checking this out."

I got this game mostly because I was bored and looking for something different. Boy was I surprised by how different this game is. It has the sea exploration somewhat like Subnautica but it's also very much running a shop. You upgrade your gear to continue to get deeper and find newer stuff. You can upgrade your shop recipes as you continue to get more stuff. You can change the shop decoration as well as higher and level up staff of your choosing. There is a book to fill with all the different fish you find so you can complete that too. So far I'm very impressed and happy with this game. Definitely found a gem!"

I got sucked into the initial gameplay loop, which felt like a really robust old Kongregate hidden gem with ""number go up"" upgrade progression revealing more and more systems that also want bigger numbers. But the momentum dies as the core loop keeps getting interrupted for more (and more (and more)) unskippable cutscenes, tutorials, and interruptions. I just sat down to play a quick fishing dive and the day started with two separate quest dialogues with new associated objectives (including one that consisted of calling another character to actually receive an objective). Then a reminder popped up about a two-day timer ticking down that I didn't initiate, and then I remembered tat the day before had set up an entirely new game mode separate from all that stuff with its own currencies and minigames with obsessively deep progression systems, the intro to all of which was set in a zone I couldn't save my progress in. I didn't go collect fish to sell at a sushi restaurant after all that; I just turned off the game instead.

I want to say this is fun in bursts and that hopefully I come back. But right now I still feel like I'm waiting for the tutorials to stop so I can just enjoy my nostalgic game that feels like I'm on a Flash site in the late 2000s, and that is simultaneously surprising to experience at all in 2023 but also reaaaaaaally spoiled by unskippable, unsaveable stretches that are becoming more and more of my time playing rather than that nice nostalgic upgrade grind I was sold on."

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
This game is just perfect. Barely even played 2 hours and I can already confidently call it a masterpiece, and that's before it's even fully released! The gameplay loop is incredibly engaging; it uniquely blends two genres that are usually seen independently - exploration/resource gathering/crafting, and restaurant management/customisation. This works flawlessly and gives the game great variation, preventing it from growing stale, as you are swapping between these two fronts with great pacing. Both sides of the game are enjoyable and feel rewarding, with frequent feature unlocks that add additional layers to the game, customisation options, gear upgrades, and collectibles (namely a Pokémon-esque card system, a perfect optional feature for completionists).

The combat feels fair and can honestly be avoided in many cases, making the game accessible for most players, as it caters to casual playstyles as well as allowing for more intense intentional challenge.

The pixel art is gorgeous, 2.5D was the perfect choice of medium - the world is vivid and the art style feels unique. You can tell how much love was poured into it just through the visuals. There are detailed, animated pixel art cutscenes to accompany certain restaurant upgrades, and their inclusion showcases passion (as in, the game would feel no less whole if they were absent - their existence is just a cherry on top).

Originally Dave the DRIVER, the main character enters a coma and proceeds to become Dave the Diver.

Game is great and a lot of fun, I rarely recommends something before finishing the actual game, but there's so much content and everything is so much fun that I cannot help but to do so, even if the base game only had around 20% of what it already does, it would be a good purchase.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Wonderful little game right here that came out of nowhere for me.

It has two parts to it...

1. You have the diving elements where you have to get fish for the sushi bar. You go diving for fish and other goodies.

2. You then have the Sushi bar part which is you making the menu based on what fish you got and help out when customers come

It is a wonderful mix and super chill. Also lastly the dialogue is great, its a real wholesome game in general but especially with the dialogue.

If you want a fun chill and relaxing game that is a nice mix of adventure diving and fishing in the water and also sushi bar management give it a try!

No joke at all when I say this is in my Top 10 games of 2022, which includes the likes of Elden Ring. The game has a ton of charm, fun gameplay, nice art design and just wholesome all the way around. Already in great shape, I can't wait to see what else gets added to the game down the road, its a wonderful start here.

Fantastic game. Very addictive gameplay loop, great music, great game to play to destress and relax, and hilariously entertaining cutscenes. My only complaint is that it is kinda short as I've been able to do most everything in it in about 15-20 hours of play, but it's only $20 and it's still in EA so I'm sure I'll be getting a lot more time out of it anyway.

And they're constantly adding improvements as well. Was going to put in feedback that we could use a sort option in the recipe menu and they did in today's update (are they psychic?).

Very addictive in all the right ways!

Update post release:
Still loving this game but with the full release, we've got some new content that doesn't feel fully fleshed out yet. Stuff like:

Enemy movement can get kinda jank

Bug where the game forgot my keyboard existed (only once thankfully).

Some minigames are a little wonky. Mario one has weird spacing and the stealth level is meh

Could use more breathing room between events

Less button mashing. Could use an accessibility option for it and just turn it down anyway. My keyboard is going to call the police on me

Overall, still loving the game, would be a 10/10 were it not for the above issues and it's still like 9/10 with them. Excellent game that could use a couple updates."

( full review with screenshots: https://www.gaming-parrot.com/post/dave-the-diver-review-low-pressure-diving )

I wish I could leave a neutral score, but given the options I'm closer to recommending it than not.

Dave the Diver is a laid back game about diving into a semi-randomized ocean trench in order to catch loads of exotic fish to supply a sushi restaurant. Or, at least, that's what it is at the beginning. Dave will still be a diver at the end of the game, but along the way he'll end up moonlighting as a waiter, a farmer, a gambler, and many, many other things. There have been plenty of games over the years that start with a ridiculously ambitious concept and only implement half the systems you'd expect, but Dave starts with a very simple concept and dumps an MMO's worth of subsystems on top of it. There's no denying that it's unique, but does it work?

The early systems certainly do. Diving has a whiff of roguelite about it since the things you'll encounter are slightly different with every round and you're forced to find most of your equipment in the water. The first biome mostly has your standard tropical fish that you'd expect from a glance at the game, but you'll find more interesting encounters as you go deeper. Although the diving gameplay is largely the same from start to finish, boss fights and one-off encounters shake things up occasionally. It does feel pointlessly restrictive that some of the boss fights can only be done on a specific day, especially since you're allowed as many retries as you want, but none of them are hard enough for that to be a huge issue. Outside of some tedious puzzle sections about 80% of the way through the game, the diving is consistently enjoyable.

The restaurant is similarly mostly solid. There's almost no depth to it, but it's satisfying in the same way that old Flash-style time management games were. You pick some fish to use as sushi ingredients for the night and then spend the rest of your time running back and forth between customers and the kitchen to deliver their food or server them drinks. You can hire staff to be able to handle more guests or prepare sushi more quickly, but in either case you're really just spending money to make the game play itself faster. A very late side quest introduces a Cooking Mama-style minigame that I wish had been used more, and I'd also have liked to see decorations have any kind of discernible effect. Buying them feels very wasteful when they don't obviously do anything and the game constantly wants your money for more impactful items.

The systems introduced later in the game are a mixed bag at best. Most of them fit a pattern of being basically fine, but not terribly fleshed out and collectively tedious. You'll have three different farms producing five different kinds of resources by the end of the game, but each of them basically amounts to spending money and then waiting to get the outputs. Any seahorses you catch can be used for racing, but that's just button mashing where you'll win easily as long as your stats are decent. Many of these systems are also extremely grindy. You can improve sushi recipes to boost their stats, for example, but doing this requires spending increasingly huge amounts of fish meat for each level. Similarly, prices to upgrade your farms or equipment escalate quickly and have many levels, so even with an efficient restaurant it can take quite a while before you're able to make relatively marginal improvements. And don't even get me started on the stealth level."

I wanna be brief why I wouldn't recommend getting the game even though it's great in many aspects.
While the game looks and sounds fantastic, the more I play the more I get the feeling that the developers just doesn't respect the time of the player. Every new mechanic (which you will get in an endless rapidfire stream) just tries to be take as long as you can barely tolerate.
The best example for this a the frequent puzzle sections in the story sections. The game tells you without fail how to solve all new puzzle mechanics and then you just have complete them, which comes down to picking up rocks and slowy swim with them somewhere or pull something down a few meters. In the later parts you are also in nearly no danger because your airmeter is most of the time between 70 and 90 percent full when you find the next container with new air.
The only danger in the game are some really annoying enemies, that do obnoxious amounts of damage, and bosses.
Those are awesome for the most part (I even liked the mantis shrimp, even though the tip at the start of the battle will lead you away from the stuff you should really do) but having a cool bossbattle every few hours that you can't even repeat and than another 1-4 hours boring busywork is just soul crushing.
If mintrocket would have concentrated more on making mechanics more fun and less on cramming as much of them in this game, I'm sure this would have been contender for game of the year for me.
I will probably still finish the game and update the review, if anything big changes but for me right now it's a clear no for the recommendation. Not because the game is bad or to expensive but because it just wastes it's potential by wasting your time."

This is a great game and I would have given it a positive review, but one problem makes it unplayable for people like me. If you have any sort of carpal tunnel or hand/wrist issues, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. They force you to do button mashing quicktime events that require you to mash the button super fast. There are no accessibility options to change this and I physically cannot place this game without hurting myself."
dave+the+diver,Not Recommended,0.4,"Posted: July 1
EDIT: Devs have responded that they're working on it, so fingers crossed that this will be a recommend soon. Looking forward to this game.

Each time you harpoon a fish you have to do a lame ""mash space as quickly as you can"" action. Not only is that boring, loud enough to wake sleeping family members, and unchallenging, but it's an accessibility issue. I have a physical limitation that makes it difficult and painful to rapidly smash a key.

Looking at the forum, there's a ~30 page thread stretching back the better part of a year of similar complaints. It baffles that the devs haven't added the option of a different mini game, or at least a simple option to disable the button-mash one. The latter should be a very, very simple thing to implement.

I'd love to play this, but that needs to change before I can. Fingers crossed, but not very hopeful given the radio silence to date."

A great time!

Dives take place in a variable hole of limited breadth but plenty of depth, with deeper regions containing pricier but also more dangerous & resilient sea life. There's a real sense of adventure that comes with a limited oxygen capacity & fearsome aquatic life that can end your dive before it's really begun. While it's not a hard game, there's a real risk/reward to be had throughout the game when it comes to dangerous species like sharks, whose meat might be valuable, but at much higher potential cost. Utilizing the gold you make from selling your sushi is the key to upgrading your gear to go deeper, while also making sure you have enough to run the business. During the story you'll also unlock several items that'll make your trips more fun & open up new opportunities for you.

The management side of things is enjoyable with enough layers to keep you invested, with more being unlocked as you progress through the campaign. There's hundreds of dishes & ingredients to be found & mastered, so making the most of what you have access to is important. Add to that fish farm & farm management later in the game, staffing concerns & more besides, you'll find there's plenty here to min-max if you're into that sort of thing.

The cast is fun & expands nicely alongside minigames, collectathon side content, and a story that's charming despite being a little bit all over the place later on. The game is packed to the brim with references & nods to other games that I'll not spoil here, but they definitely hit the mark more often than not.

It's not all good however. The game has some puzzle segments which aren't really puzzle segments as much as they are time wasters due to their ridiculous simplicity, but that still doesn't stop Dave telling you ""huh, maybe I should pull that lever"" - well, yes Dave, thanks for the tip. The final few acts of the game in general feel a bit scatterbrained & rushed, but they don't detract too much from the overall experience as you can fish/collect/cook as much as you want in the post-game anyway.

Overall, while far from perfect, Dave the Diver's addicting gameplay loop, charming presentation & lovable cast make for an experience I won't be forgetting any time soon!"

Honestly, better than I thought it was going to be.

I'm sorry but I have to agree with a lot of the negative comments that really appreciate the game - just as I do - but criticize the type of game it starts off and shifts to. The comfy early-game definitely wears off after some time.

What starts out as a Stardew Valley with fishes quickly evolves to boss battles after boss battles with forced mini games that reward button mashing and tedious puzzles that are neither fun nor challenging.
Although for some reason some boss battles are ruthless since enemies are large, have rapid dashes and damage you on touching you (so getting bit by a shark is equally damaging as touching his back fin).

Also, a lot of quest interactions are forced and teleport you around without consent. For example you could be planning on getting ingredients and finishing a quest in one run but a lot of times a quest ends in you just getting teleported back to your boat with no way of knowing beforehand.
This can easily be fixed by asking ""Are you ready to leave?"" in some way or form so you can finish looting or gatheting something in your vicinity.

The first few hours were definitely the best, right now it's just getting more stressful and tedious.
When I want to play a game to chill out, this will not be on the list any longer.

While this review might seem negative, I do agree with the positive feedback this game has gotten."

I have been playing it since pre-release and was more than excited for the full-game.
I am more than satisfied!

For people who enjoy single-player games.
This game is a masterpiece.
I am out of words to write a review because I can't describe how flawless it is.
Music / Art / Story / Weapons/ Crafting system / Upgrades / Boss fights and the entire concept is well executed. With the full release they implemented Puzzles as well which are enjoyable!


Oh. And I am Japanese so I might be biased??? I love Sushi. <3

But truly, this game is very fun for those of you who are into playing alone. It encompasses everything you'd look for in a single-player game.
My only sadness is that I know this game might end someday but it will be one of the masterpiece-games I will always remember."

The game was so fun at the start when I was just catching fish and running the restaurant but the devs try to make this game so boring for some reason. So many ""tasks"" that you have to complete are you just holding spacebar and carrying an object underwater from point A to point B, no challenge, no fun just tedium.

There's an underwater fish people village that you visit early on and while that sounds really cool it is one of the most boring parts of the game. The villager quests are so boring and uninspired once again consisting of the same hold space here and move to here mechanics.

A good example of the devs realizing how slow this game is yet doing nothing about it also happens in that village. In the underwater village you move so slowly and the village is massive, simply crossing across it is a 2 minute excursion. The devs must have realized that because they added a underwater taxi that you can ride only in that village, except it triggers a cut scene each time you summon it, it disappears whenever you go into any building and it uses that villages exclusive currency each time you summon it again. Thereby making even the fast travel slow and punishing.

Can't wait for the sequel to this game where you manage a paint drying business."

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
TLDR; This game has a lot of charm. I feel as though there are flaws to the diving experience that make it difficult to enjoy at times, so I can't say that I recommend it at its current state.

--
- The restaurant aspect is quite fun; I wish it were more central to the gameplay! The process of growing your business is addictive, and I think this is where it shines. The animations for special guests, interactive food serving mechanics (like serving various drinks!); the only issue I have is that I wish it could be longer. Granted, I'm only two chapters in, and I understand that this game is meant to focus on the diving part.

Unfortunately, to say that the restaurant part outshines the diving part is telling of the latter's flaws. I have a growing list of issues in my diving experience that is making it difficult to enjoy.

- Scripted diving moments feel too disruptive. I might go down to focus on catching all kinds of fish as well as finishing up a fetch quest for a customer only to end up fighting a boss I did not expect. The rude interruptions of my expeditions (where after certain quests are complete, I'm forced to go back up to the boat and wait for the next day to fish again) is not fun.

There was a countdown toward an event where I had to prepare a bunch of menu items of a specific kind (jellyfish), and when the day came, a quest regarding the sea people forced me to miss the opening of the restaurant. I thought I had missed the event as well and was upset. Fortunately, it did push to the next day, but this felt like a bug to me.

- There should be an ability to reference other info besides quests while diving. I get that having a smartphone underwater is not realistic, but I feel like it's necessary to be able to access info on what fish you need to get (for certain menu items, for achievements). Or even like, where I could find certain fish? All of this is available on your phone and the restaurant, but not while you're diving? Just something to think about.

- Diving controls feel really muddy to me. This issue is glaring especially during combat events; it just isn't fun to struggle because aiming is limited and you can't turn as quickly to avoid wide attacks. I wish that moving around felt more responsive, but it's too slow and limiting at its current state. I know that charms exist to boost certain stats, but in my opinion the difference is negligible.

I am sure that time will either prove that the developers can create a more cohesive, enjoyable experience, or that this game is simply not for me. I really want to like this game, so my fingers are crossed."

This game is absolutely ridiculous. Swiping surfaces up and down in repetitive motions for hours. Cleaning a million nooks and crannies, sitting in front of the computer screen like a hypnotized zombie.
Two reasons why I recommend this game: One, it is the perfect game for switching off your brain, when you want to advance time and you don't have a cryosleep chamber nearby. Two, at some point playing this game, you will pause and be forced to consider whether or not you are living your life to the fullest. Hence, the repercussions of playing this game could lead to a dramatic existential crisis, when you realize all the precious heartbeats you have wasted while being zombified will never come back."

This game stands on a mighty pedestal above everything else with a half-ironic ""simulator"" title released in the past two decades.

PowerWash Simulator is not a sim, and it knows that. Every object you clean is just a texture layered on another texture, and different nozzles/guns remove that texture more efficiently than others. You're waving a Photoshop delete tool around for twenty hours.

The beauty of PWS comes from the writing. This isn't one of the dozens of shovelware Polish 'sim' games pumped out every quarter. The writing isn't edgy for the sake of being edgy to give streamers something to react to during the first two hours. Story and charming character work doesn't magically stop happening after the two hour Steam refund window is up. If anything, the breadcrumbs of story in PWS snowball into a big, goofy, overarching story about wacky occurrences in this small metro area that all - coincidentally - require the services of a professional power washer.

If you've read this far, please take it from me: power through the tree house level. Keep in mind that hitting the C button to detatch your cursor and allow you to move the washer around the screen is a CRUCIAL tool. Ignore the stats on the washers, they're all direct upgrades."

When I am having a bad day or anxious about a situation that has come up, this game helps.

EDIT: Almost 2100 hours I've logged in this game. It sucks that I have to say this: do not buy any of the DLC except for nostalgia purposes. Be careful even then. That being said, not even my extreme Final Fantasy VII nostalgia could make me like the Midgar pack. Spongebob and Tomb Raider? Don't waste your money. This team has gotten away, FAR away, from the winning formula that made this game great. It was unique, it was innovative, but now it's banking on other brands for a fresh breath of life. Now, everything is an intense slog to find every tiny nook and cranny and getting just the precise angle to clean 99.9999% of every dirt speck because your completion thresholds are ridiculous. The base game is worth it, but don't bother with anything else.

Go back to what you started with. Expand on that. FINISH THE STORY. Stop trying to turn a buck because you rode the wave of popularity and are now too lazy to want to do anything but make bank off other people's creations, with or without their permission.

Probably won't be playing this much more except when my friends want to play. This game has become a serious disappointment.

EDIT: Almost 1600 hours in, and I am convinced I was a power washer in a previous life.

I have no life now. I've sold all my worldly possessions except my PC and gaming setup. I live off ramen and multivitamins. I've reset my progress more than a speedrunner playing Ninja Gaiden. I see orange flashes in my dreams, and then I wake up only to be reminded that I missed three tiny specks on the last level I played, so I have to reset everything and start over. If God exists, when I meet them I will ask them one question: ""can I get the extra long extension prior to the fire helicopter?"" To which they will answer ""no, my son, you gotta put in the work."""

I really like this game, very satisfying :)

The only ""grievance"" I have with this game is that it seems things are considered clean when you reach a certain percentage, that's fine for most thing. But my inner perfectionist feels a bit cheated when it comes to big objects like walls and floors, like I'm getting punished for being thorough. I've cleaned almost the entire wall/floor and there's only one big patch of dirt left in the middle. I start on it, but then the wall is considered clean enough and the big patch of dirt just disappears xD and I'm sitting there like ""but I wasn't done D:"" but yeah, that's probably just me, so if no one else complains about it, just forget it, hehe x)"

As someone in their early 40s this game is a god sent. I like shooters, most of my life I played shooters but as of late the kid that killed me and teabagged me called me a boomer 3 times before I realise I am dead. (I need to protest, I am gen x, not a boomer, nor a milenial)

My reflexes have become ♥♥♥♥. And while a few years ago I could compensate my slow pysical decline by playing methodical and strategic I can't any more.

This is where this shooter comes in. It lets me show everything I have learned, mastered, perfectioned one last time. From mastery of shooting angles to choice of right tool (sniper to spray and pray).

This game comes with a really stupid simple premise that's done extraordinarily well - you spray water at things until they're clean. Doesn't sound like fun, but it's incredibly soothing and satisfying to see something covered in mud and dirt suddenly pop with live and vibrant colors - and sorting out a method of which you tackle these projects is a different sort of fun in itself.

Think of it like a coloring book from your childhood - except the giant building is the book and the pressure washer is your crayon. The level of organization (or chaos) is up to you. Do you want to spray a bunch of wangs in the mud? Or do you just want to climb on top of the truck and start spraying from there? The grime is your oyster.

Also, the game has a story for some reason. The people you get the projects from text you while you clean their crap and it's hilarious and charming - there's actually a few of the reoccurring customers that I came to enjoy and looked forward to seeing if I get to do more for them!

The only thing that could make it even better are custom maps. With mod/steam workshop support. This game would reach a whole different lvl of potential and longevity.
I would still reccomend it as it is."

I have played WAY too many hours of this game.... I replay the free-play levels regularly to relax, especially before bed.
I once had a guy come over for a date. He, for whatever reason, decided to immediately sit at my desk where I had just been gaming, opens up steam, and starts browsing my games. Then says ""Why do you have over 250 hours in Power Wash Simulator lol"".

He did not last long before getting kicked out. Unlike Power Wash Simulator, my love, which I have since put 50 more hours in, and counting. SUPER excited with the new (and free!) additions like the Tomb Raider levels, and potential future DLC. Given that I bought it for like $20 and have had THIS MUCH fun with it, its well worth the money if they keep adding things for me to clean. Maybe its because I'm Hispanic, but I really love this game.

I pretty much just exclusively do levels with the highest level power washer to relax, although it is pretty fun to work your way up from the crappy starter power washer to the fancy one with all the bells and whistles. Highly recommend putting on some lo-fi hip hop and just zoning out to this game.

My coworkers are still trying to figure out how to weaponize my obsession with powerwashing by hooking up a real power-washer to a controller so I can clean their driveways. If only...."

I typically try to avoid games that make mundane tasks into gameplay. Games that have the suffix “simulator” usually have weak mechanics and rely on the novelty of playing something that iis normally a chore or a hobby at best. Power washing, however, moves just outside this classification by being a task that usually isn’t an everyday event and has unique properties that make it pretty fulfilling. If there’s one thing PowerWash Simulator definitively does, it delivers an authentic experience.

Abbreviated Review:
YouTube™ Video: PowerWash Simulator - Cleaning with the Cleansing Power of Water | Abbreviated Reviews 


Making a game exactly like reality usually isn’t a good option. That’s not absolute since there are plenty of flight simulators pushing that boundary every day, but people generally play games for pleasure and it’s not always fun to deal with the clunky aspects of reality. The pressure washer you use in PowerWash Simulator doesn’t have any of the typical limitations of a pressure washer. You don’t have any hoses or a need to maintain a power or water source. It’s as though you simply have a gun that can blast away dirt wherever you are without stopping. You also don’t have to worry about the frustration of switching tips for different spray effects since a simple scroll of the mouse wheel achieves that. It streamlines virtually every annoying aspect of high-pressure cleaning with water.

However, when it comes to the actual cleaning part, PowerWash Simulator provides an experience as close to the real thing as I could imagine. Visually, it excellently captures the sheen of water in the wake of the cleaning path and the way it dries on a sunny day. Each of the tips for the wand provides distinct patterns that vary between the highest-pressure beams of water and broad fans that remove only the lightest dirt – but in the widest area. Every soiled surface has distinct properties you’ll need to address and, while you could use the strongest most-precise nozzle on it all, you’d be wasting a lot of time on the areas that don’t require that much effort.

The only limiting factor of PowerWash Simulator is how long you want to spend playing it. You could, if you want, use the strongest and narrowest tip and clean an entire skatepark in one-inch swaths of concentrated water. You won’t get paid any more for this, or less for taking an eternity, since nothing is timed in the campaign. The payment is simply for completing the task in the perpetual daylight of each level. However, I spent nearly 40 hours playing this game and if I had employed that tactic, I imagine it would have been three times that. Besides, part of the challenge is figuring out the most efficient way to tackle those soiled surfaces. That, of course, means testing various positions, washer tips, and spending your money upgrading your washer to the best one available.

There are only four options for upgrading the power washer itself, and despite having a list of stats, each iteration is distinctly better than the last. There are limitations to upgrades beyond just using the money you earn though, you also need to have enough stars – which are earned as you complete each job. I assumed intiially these were tied to the quality or speed of work you did, but it’s simply one star at set points in the cleaning process until everything is clean and you receive the fifth and final one. Once you have the requisite star power though, upgrading is a obvious way to take on bigger jobs with more difficult dirt and grime. For instance, the early washers might not be able to take on paint or other sticky problems, but with an upgrade, you can easily wipe them out.

You can also spend your money on additional sprayer tips that provide unique patterns like a rotating direct jet that covers a larger area with that typically concentrated blast. There are even wand extensions that let you reach higher areas without having to drag out a ladder to place at the predefined locations of every project. If you want to move a little faster on a project, you can also get a soap sprayer and buy a limited supply of detergents that will melt away stains on specific surfaces over a broad area. Using this wasn’t particularly satisfying and seemed like a waste of money in most instances, but I will admit I used it on some levels had huge floor areas that needed cleaning.

PowerWash Simulator has quite a few surprises up its rubberized jumpsuit sleeves. The first, was just how engrossing and cathartic the experience is. Real-life power washing is great and all, but after ten minutes you have soggy shoes and you’re uncomfortably damp from the water that bounces back. In this virtual world, however, you don’t have to deal with any of that. You just have a raw unhindered glory of watching dirt get stripped away. Almost every action you take is progress toward your ultimate goal, so there is no wasted time or even a failure state. You play until you succeed.

It was also surprising that the campaign has a loose but compelling bit of narrative interwoven within it. It’s not anything that’s book-worthy, but it does tie together some of the different jobs you go on, especially later in the game. It is, at the very least, surprising enough that I don’t think I should spoil it for you if you’ve read this far. Yet, I believe its implementation and the strange projects it justifies in the final half dozen stages lift the game a couple of pegs.

Most of my time in PowerWash Simulator I was either listening to podcasts or streaming shows. It works perfectly because the game doesn’t have music and few sounds beyond pressurized water hitting various surfaces. You can also just stop whenever you feel like it and watch a scene because that dirt isn’t going to sneak up and backstab you while you do. However, even when I wasn’t splitting my attention, I was still absorbed by this experience. It’s strange how appealing it is, and how long that appeal last, for something that lacks much diversity in gameplay. Despite my nearly 40 hours in this game, and completion of the campaign, I think I’ll end up back in there soon cleaning some of the last special projects and maybe doing some of the timed or water-limited jobs. Whatever I decide on, I believe it’s worth picking up in its fully released format."

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
The Zen element of PWS has been covered and yes it's the major selling point as you can literally feel the tension in your body melting away every time you boot it up.

But I'd like to highlight the expert learning curve found in the increasingly complex work orders.

You start in a small garage with what will soon be your very own work truck. A easy task with 5 flat surfaces, front, sides, back, roof. Simple enough.

Then things get a little more spicy. Outside jobs featuring common fence posts, rails & pickets that need to be approached from a 360° angle in order to nab all that dirt from every side. Sometime using ladders and scaffolding to treat multilevel targets.

Fast forward to late game and you suddenly find yourself face to face with a rescue helicopter. It's not the size of the job, but rather to unique complexity of all the moving parts. The fine geometric details found within the rotor mast, transmission and hydraulic control unit.

Each new job trains the player to get in there and soak down targets of increasing complexity at a natural pace so it's not just a simple rinse & repeat affair (lol). Terrific pacing on offer here that makes you look forward to what's coming next.

Bright & eye-popping presentation deserve special props too. Along with simply fantastic game-engine performance. The world just feels just fine to inhabit. Super inviting.

Simply put PowerWash Simulator finds itself barreling headfirst to a podium finish of my GOTY Top 10.

HIGHLY recommended."

Exactly what I wanted out of this game. I'm hoping that they'll eventually allow steam workshop to allow people to make their own maps as that would potentially make playability infinite, but really enjoying this so far!

If you like House Flipper or Viscera Cleanup Detail, you'll like this. Very satisfying.

No Man’s Sky is like a guy who owes you $1,000 from 6 years ago coming back with $10,000 to repay you after you thought the money was gone.

I really like this game. I’ve been playing it for years on and off, returning after every major update to see the state of things. No man’s Sky might be a fantastic game now, but you gotta always remember how it all begun. When the game first came out it could best be described to had been as wide as the ocean, but having the depth of a puddle.

The game has improved so much from when it came out that it is easily one of my favorite space exploration games nowadays. One of the greatest redemption stories in video game history. It’s almost like they used the money they earned from sales to actually improve the game.

I love the idea of having this massive sandbox shared experience, where coincidentally anybody can stumble upon my little bases I scattered, mines, etc. I also love flying around the stars in my ship, discovering new planets, finding weird animals, plants, geography…

The sense of adventure and the thrill of finding some new world makes me have so much fun. If you like exploring and just taking your time doing things, this game is a must, and I highly recommend it.

The truth is no matter what you think of the game we should all be grateful of what we’ve gotten. If No Man’s Sky was made by EA, all these updates throughout the years would probably have been released as $60 new games each.

I’ll be honest, at this rate and with these devs I have a feeling No Man’s Sky has a better chance of of becoming what Star Citizen strives to be than Star Citizen.

Every now and then though, whenever I see a game trailer that I really enjoy, I like to remember the state of this game when it first came out and how awful it was. It keeps me in check and helps my expectations stay grounded.

Original Review:
Don't let that ""mixed"" up there under review scores fool you: this game has changed SO much from its disastrous launch back in 2016. When this launched it was, as one commentator put it, ""wide as an ocean, but shallow as a puddle."" But Hello Games did something remarkable: instead of devolving into pay-to-win bullsh*t like we have seen time and time again, they sat back down, got to work, and have spent nearly five years releasing free update after free update, transforming the game in such a way it makes the launch build look like an early access beta.

Want to be an explorer and just find as many planets as possible? Go for it. Want to be a space pirate and just steal all the stuff you need instead? Go ahead. Want to stick to just a few planets and build a mega industrial complex that prints more money than 1920's Germany, then realise that you're way in over your head and need to build a money farm just to build your money farm? Have fun. And if any of this is too boring alone, toss down a portal and invite your friends to play.

If you bought this back at launch and felt like it was boring or shallow, I say to you, give it another go. I did, and I can say wholeheartedly that I was not disappointed.
Bravo, Hello Games. Bravo."

Well the game's good, but this review is mostly for the Hello Games team.

They could run from the game with all our money, they could abandon the game like Bioware with their anthem, they could put subscriptions and microtransactions upon their paid game like what Bethesda do with their Fallout 76, they could put DLC upon DLCs like what so many developers do with their games, but nope. They go back to the office and get ♥♥♥♥♥ done, polishing what should be a giant pile of disappointment into an actual good stuff with constant updates.

For that, the team got my respect for their commendable attitude. Sean Murray probably isn't a very good marketer, but he's a damn good game developer and team leader."

I was one of the many people who pre preordered this game at launch.

I bought a second hand ps4 just to play this game, i was fully aboard the hype train.

After 30 hours in game at launch.. I wasnt angry, just disappointed. But thats so much worse isnt it?

I turned off that ps4 for the final time in august 2016 and never turned it on again.

I ignored every update they released, assuming at its core the game was the same.


My little gamer group decided to randomly give it a chance last week on steam, and oh boy is this game different.

Imagine the hype you felt at this games announcement, imagine all the things hello games promised coming to fruition. Now imagine they added more stuff in... just because.

No mans sky has quickly and vehemently become my new obsession, the gameplay is engaging, immersive, fun and full of ""wow"" moments.
Its buttery smooth, so well optimised and cross play pretty much sets itself up.

You play it for a bit, hit up the wiki for an answer to how to find a good ship, then you spend 4 hours deep diving into the lore, which is where i got fully hooked. The lore is incredible.


This is the game i always dreamed of, and i imagine the game sean and the team originally thought up in their caffeine fueled manic state.

And, they are constantly updating it with major content additions.

For free.

No loot boxes

No dlc

Free.

For anyone asking ""should i give NMS another chance?"" The answer is hell yes, DO IT NOW.

For anyone seeing this game for the first time, prepare for something very, very special."

I've never written a review before for anything but that is changing right now. I discovered No Man's Sky about a month ago. I originally bought it to play in VR but quickly discovered that it was also enjoyable on the PC once I got the hang of the key mappings.

I've never played console games but it's safe to say I'm hooked with just over 150 hours in the last 3 weeks. I look forward to the daily Nexus missions and only have one more before I have enough quicksilver to get an important item, I got my freighter a couple of days ago and I LOVE fighting pirates.

Two things this game will be remembered for:

1. How overhyped and exceptionally terrible it was when it first launched
2. Even an atrocious launch can be salvaged and redeemed if the developers aren't crooks and have passion for what they do.

Probably the best redemption story in game history. The lesson for consumers here is don't believe the hype & don't pre-order. The lesson for developers is don't overhype your games, don't release unfinished games and if things go bad, keep your head down and keep working on fixing and improving even when the world absolutely hates your guts.

Ok. Is someone actually still reading these reviews? Well if you get to this one, among the thousands of reviews for NMS, then you really are committed. As I'm sure you know by now, this game was an utter fail when it was released. The description of the game sounded so amazing, like everything you could ever want from a space-themed, sandbox builder. It was lame and repetitive with a low variety of content. The launch was done all wrong and, the term 'false advertising' was kicked around a lot. Well, luckily the developers didn't stop. It is now a complete game. There are SO many aspects to this game from flight (space or on planet), farming (mining), exploration, discovery, fighting off attacks from animals and drones (sentinels), to my favorite, amazing base-building with SO FREAKING MANY build options. They keep adding new ones too. Hello Games also recently released VR support, and it's really well done. There's something about being able to walk around in the base that you built, in real scale with VR. Hundreds of hours have gone into some of the most amazing bases I've built, and am planning for hundreds more."

Hello Games acknowledged that they messed up by overhyping the game and lying about features that weren't present at launch.

Hello Games buckled down and started fixing the game and adding features free of charge instead of taking the money and running.

Hello Games went from being maligned to admired by most everyone who has played their vastly-improved No Man's Sky as well as their other work, all thanks to admitting fault and fixing their mistake.

Be like Hello Games.

My buddy and I got most of the hours in together and I enjoyed them well, we found a ""paradise"" type planet in the galaxy we spawned in so made that our home planet, built a nice base and called it ""Paradise Islands."" We eventually fell out of the game, as you all know. He also ended up getting rid of his gaming PC and shortly after an unfortunate turn of events, he had taken his own life. I thought I'd never be able to play No Mans Sky alone until today. Over this past weekend I got the Valve Index and saw that, low and behold, its VR compatible. After building up the mental strength to play I decided to see how it goes. I got the controls down before I took off from where my last save was at. Went to a space station, tried to deter myself from using the teleporter to my home planet but inevitably I was drawn to seeing our Paradise Islands again and if it'd changed over the updates at all. When I arrived home, I went outside to check out the surroundings, jetpacked on top of the facility we built and all I see is a massive rainbow spanning from one side of the horizon to the other. I instantly started to cry. The perfect representation of life, its there one minute and gone the next. I gathered the resourced needed, and erected a Golden Traveler statue peering out at where the rainbow was in honor of my fallen intergalactic interloper. I love you dude and I ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ miss you."

For many years, (I am 64), I have played space exploration, colonization and strategy games, hoping to feed my dreams of actually living in and exploring space. I don't have much of a taste for endless combat, I just wanted to explore star systems, planets and asteroid fields and imagine what it would really be like to live my dreams.

No Man's Sky is the closest thing to living in and exploring space that I have found so far. It certainly has room for improvement, but there are so many features and things to do that it has kept me busy so far. Love it."

As everyone knows, No Man's Sky is a modern cautionary tale about pre-release game development. What not everyone knows, but people are slowly beginning to learn, is that it's also an exemplar of ongoing game development. Like many, I bought NMS at launch, and was underwhelmed by it. I wasn't outraged, as so many were, but it seemed like a great example of over-promising and under-delivering. I played enough to get bored with the mechanics, marveled a bit at the color and scope of the worlds while being frustrated with the mechanics, and blundered around without a very well-defined tutorial path. Then I went on to other things instead.

Four years later, all of the good things about NMS have been retained and improved, all of the bad things have been resolved, and features I never even hoped for have been added. The dev team has been responsive, engaged and imaginative. It would have been understandable for Hello Games to fold up, after an Icarus story so painfully acted out, but instead they doubled down on their commitments and have turned No Man's Sky into a genuinely wonderful gaming experience.

I honestly cannot say enough positive things about it. It is a shining example of how game development can work when driven by a team that wants to do the absolute best they can for their audience, delivering content-filled updates regularly without asking a penny more than the original cost of the game. I have looked for ways to give them more of my money, and have settled for evangelizing about it to all of my friends. Especially now - if you have free time, get NMS."

Check out the Internet Historians video for the best description of the fall and rise of this game, but personal opinions on it, I really enjoy it, is a bit grindy at times, combat is pretty solid, ship piloting is pretty smooth, the mission system is cool, and base building is awesome, the game does still has a few optimization issues, and bug fixes that will probably be worked out soon, but all in all the game is a 8/10 not a bad game anymore but also not without its own flaws. i recommend anyone to check it out if you can."

Internet Historian was right.

Whatever was wrong with this game at the outset, is gone. With Hello Games' hard work, they've made a game everyone says was bad, into a game that is actually pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥' good.

And given their track record after release, it'll only get better. I mean c'mon, they could've just taken the millions they made and ran off. Instead they busted their asses finishing this game and making it better than even THEY could have imagined.

I came to this game completely blind and I didn't know what kind of game it was. I just wanted to fly a cool spaceship and explore. But oh boy was I in for a treat... I realise there was this huge controversy regarding expectations and lack of features when it first launched. But the state that the game is in now makes it difficult to see that.

This game ticks so many boxes it's crazy. Build a spacefleet? You just have to ask yourself if you want to be a trader, a pirate or fleet of explorers like captain Picard. Want to colonize a planet? Ask yourself if you want it on a planet like earth or on ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Mustafar. Heck, do it underwater!

And the visuals, my god it's beautiful. Either just flying around in space watching three suns illuminate an entire system of planets, or taking a walk on the surface at night surrounded by glowing mushrooms over 5 meters tall and bioluminescent purple grass.

The best thing about this game is that you can play it however you want. You can be everything from a spacefaring vagabond to a lord of fleets and colonies.

If you want a first person version of Stellaris with a dash of Minecraft, this is it. I highly recommend this game."
no+mans+sky,Recommended,141.2,"Posted: December 21, 2019
Launch controversy aside, what this game should have been called for the longest time is 'Early Access'. Around the time of the Beyond update is when I'd say would have been the true 'launch'.

I didn't get this when it first came out, but even when I did it was a fragmented mess of a game. Now, finally, with the Beyond and Synthesis updates there's a solid game here that's almost (but not quite) like what Sean Murray promised way back at the beginning.

Performance on PC has dramatically improved with the switch over to the Vulkan API, and it finally supports Ultrawide and various other PC-specific options. The game itself provides a significant amount of variety, offering a combination of Elite-lite and 'Minecraft in Space' mechanics. There's plenty to see and do, and the exploration aspect is enjoyable - if a little bland. The planetary biomes and overall game could still do with further diversity, but there's plenty here to get to your teeth into.

Hello Games show no sign of slowing down their support for the game either, having just recently released a bizarre in-game music synthesizer of all things, and going by the evidence of their progress to date I can only see the game improving further as time moves on.

EDIT - 24/09/2020 ""Origins"" Patch: well, you can ignore the previous comments about diversity being a bit on the low side. They already added things like living ships, derelicts, space creatures and robots since I made this review, and with the Origins patch the variety of experience on offer is on such a scale now that I don't think I'm going to be lacking for things to do for some time. Also, impressively, the game runs even better than it did when I originally posted this - and the rejigged UI looks fantastic on Ultrawide.

Brilliant work by the team at Hello Games. I can't think of any game I've played (and I've been indulging since the late 80's) where I've ever gone from ""I can't stand this"" to ""this is one of my favourite games"". It's taken a while to get here, but No Man's Sky is definitely one of the greats."

One of my favorite games of all time. I have 'wasted' an embarrassing number of hours in this Sky. It is not a game for those who like a strong story or those who need a strong sense of direction. It truly shines as a kind of 'chose your own adventure' game.

Do you want to just see how far you can explore and how many planets you can discover and name after your cat? You can do that. And while there is more than a little repetition in the plants and animals found on those planets, there is enough variety to keep it interesting. I have a rather extensive folder of the very different and exotic animals I have discovered in my travels including a cute teddy bear creature as tall as a building and others that you can ride just for the fun of it.

Do you want to just try to find and upgrade the best ships in the galaxies to add to your collection on board your premium freighter that you finally found? You can do that. I have spent hours just looking for the best crashed ships that I can nab for free. It is like a galactic treasure hunt to find (and then upgrade) the most beautiful rides until you have a collection that Jay Leno would be envious of.

Or maybe you dream of building the most luxurious, extensive, elaborate and just plain kick-ass base (or twenty of them) that anyone in this reality has ever seen? You can do that. In fact, you can build one that reaches into the sky, is underground, is under the oceans, on top of a mountain with a gorgeous view. And if you build more than one, you can travel to all of your vast real estate holdings in the blink of an eye thanks to the magic of portals.

Or maybe ships and bases aren't your thing and you just want to become a tycoon with the most extensive collection of mining operations in the galaxies? You can do that too. Or maybe you just want to become a trader who becomes a billionaire by travelling between the different systems buying low and selling high. You can do that. Or maybe you want to become a billionaire but are also a bit of a treasure hunter? You can locate and sell historic artifacts, old bones, ancient tech.

There is just so much to do in this big, beautiful game that you can just follow your whim and do what you want. Make your own goals and then make them happen. Or don't set any goals and just meander. Do what you want and just have fun in the infinite universe!"

Let me tell you my little story about No Mans Sky.

About 4 Years ago, Sean Murray from Hello Games promised me giant Sandworms on the planets in the game he was making. It was promised in one of their pre-launch trailers. I bought the game after some deliberation, mostly because I wanted to see the giant Sandworms. They where my trigger, my selling point.

The game released. It was all a fiasco and a horrible mess. There where no worms, small or large. And the game was missing many other things. I still played it. After all I had some fun, and got some nice screenshots. But it was not what was promised. This was worming me deep inside since then. A feeling of betrayal and broken promises. I did not write a review back then.

Since back when I played the game on launch, it got many updates. I was surprised and liked what I saw on improvements over the years. But it was not enough to bring me back to the game, or heal the deep wound inside, even if the game got a lot better, and some of the broken promises got patched in.

But now No Man's Sky got its Origins Update to version 3.0
Now Sean Murray delivered to me what he promised me.



I will have to return to the game now, and watch the giant worms.

Sean Murray, is forgiven.
The wound is healed.
The worms have arriven.
I fly again.


Thank you Hello Games.
You earned yourself my positive review now.

UPDATE: As of the latest update for the game, I'm almost tempted to change my review to a negative as a huge relaxing part of the game has been all but lost to the never ending, every minute or so invasion by pirates, in pretty much every station and on every planet in the game.

I get that the devs are trying to make it more exciting, but it's beyond frustrating to be alerted to another ""Hostile ships incoming"" warning after fighting off some pirates not two minutes before. Now repeat that over and over again.

Worse yet, if you're like me and die in the water (yes, the pirates will even kill you while you're deep under water), you have to swim out to get your stuff again. Now, while you're on your way to or from your gravestone, grabbing your lost equipment, there just might be (probably will be) another group of pirates who come and kill you again.

It's relentless, and each time you're killed, something in your inventory gets damaged, so you have to worry about that now, too.

Not a fun thing. It might be more fun if the frequency were dialed down a bit.

This game had a disastrous launch. Sean Murray seemed like a lying over-promising cheat, at launch.
They could've taken the money they made and run with it, millionaires all of them.
Instead, they stuck around and made the game better and better, expansion after free expansion, improvement after improvement.

No Man's Sky went from a good concept to a beautiful reality.

This game deserves all the love it can get."

One of the best comeback stories in modern videogames. Strongly recommend for any would-be scifi adventurer into spaceships, alien worlds and space exploration, and base building or resource exploiting. I absolutely HATED this game at release after it absolutely botched the landing in apocalyptic fashion, turning all of the hype around it into one of the most stunningly underwhelming and disappointing slogs I'd ever played. That said, the commitment of the development team to rectify that massive blunder is one of the most admirable efforts I've ever seen out of a developer. They could have taken the money and ran, but they really dug in to make their game as great as they dreamed about in their head before launch and this game has come a LONG way in a BIG way because of that, and is an entirely different and far more worthwhile experience. Just watch a video of what this game was like at launch and compare that against the history of even just the first 4 updates yourself for the proof in the pudding. BARRING the catastrophic launch, this game could serve as a great template for continuing to support a released videogame. If they stopped the updates right now, hell even 3 updates ago, the game would stand as a valiant success against the odds of a pointedly deserved animosity.

The history of this game starting as one of the hardest failures in the industry wont be forgotten but that arguably serves it well, and makes for a great story for just how much hard work and dedication can improve even the worst of failures into a rousing success."

Product received for free

Honestly I can't recommend this game enough. The developers being absolute chads is reason enough for me. let me give you the timeline of updates so you can make your own opinion though.

The Foundation Update - November 2016
Now you can build a base on planets and farm resources from them as well as a plethera of other things you can use to make a base that really fits your needs and looks good while you're at it.

The Pathfinder Update - March 2017
Now you can build underground garages in those bases and drive a whole fleet of vehicles around the planet for easy access to places starships can't get to. And it also looks bad-ass.

The Atlas Rises Update - August 2017
Now instead of aimlessly wandering around the galaxy you can follow a storyline that will simultaneously show you the intricacies of the game, and peak your curiosity. 8/10 story overall for me.

No Mans Sky Next Update - July 2018
Possibly the biggest update the game ever received. This update turned the lonesome singleplayer experience into a full co-op. The greatest thing? It's all optional. When in-game, simply go to settings and find the Network section, there you can toggle all multiplayer actions, and you can even disable the multiplayer entirely. Just watch out for endgame players suddenly giving you overpowered items, or trolls giving you trash items for fun. There isn't a way to toggle other players ""gifting"" you things yet, but we hope this will be a feature soon.

The Abyss Update - October 2018
One of my personal favorites. This update adds entire oceans to the game, and even some planets that are one big ocean. This also added a whole plethera of marine plants and animals, and underwater ruins sometimes filled with, ahem, ABYSSAL HORRORS. The game calls them that, and I fully agree.

The Visions Update - November 2018
This update added a huge variety to the planets of the galaxy. It added new trees, plants and flowers, new minerals, and rock formations, new animals to roam those new lands, and rainbows and exotic trophies to hunt down inside these new environments. It also added ancient bones you could dig up and buried scrap you could salvage. As well as new community missions that helped people earn rewards as a group.

No Mans Sky Beyond - August 2019
This update worked to expand the variety in the settlements and space stations, as well as improving the Nexus Hub (The social hub for players to interact). This update also added VR support to the game. While it does take a beefy pc to run VR well, and there is still no left-handed support, the experience of a space battle in VR, exploring a planet in VR, and talking with other people in VR is quite the unique experience.

The Synthesis Update - November 2019
This was another quality of life update, improving upon many different aspects of the game. To list the major things, an improved Star Map on your spaceship, ways to upgrade your starship, ways to scrap uneeded starships, improvements to the Terrain Manipulator (The tool used for digging and moving the ground), and a way to save outfits for character customization. As well as many other smaller improvements,

The Living Ship Update - February 2020
As the name might suggest, this update added a freaking M E A T S H I P. You get it by doing a questline in which you hatch a mysterious egg. And yeah, it's a little gross to look around the inside of the cockpit. This update also added many new space encounters (One of my favorite parts of the game). Now you can find weird space creatures, destroyed starships, and even trader ships or another pilot who needs some help.

The Exo Mech Update - April 2020
A pretty small update really. It added a new vehicle to walk around planets in: the Exo Mech. The Exo Mech is pretty cool and very useful for a lot of different things. It also improved the system of other Exocraft vehicles, and added a Orbital Exocraft Materializer, which allows you to take your Exocraft with you on your giant spaceship.

The Crossplay Update - June 2020
Another smaller update. This update added crossplay, a new in-game text chat, and a friending system to easily meet with your friends. Besides some other small tweaks nothing else was added.

(You can kinda tell that 2020 hit the Devs hard because of how much smaller the updates got. Don't worry though, they didn't give up on the game.)

The DESOLATION Update - July 2020
Another one of my personal favorites. Did you ever wonder if No Mans Sky could be a horror game? Well, now you can find giant derelict freighters that are filled with gross flesh bugs that will shoot E Y E L A S E R S. Oh, and your life support and hazard protection are dropping fast so you have to collect little packets along the way and huddle next to heaters to not freeze to death. This update also added numerous lighting improvements and added ways to customize and upgrade your Freighter.

The No Mans Sky Origins Update - September 2020
No, I don't know why some updates have NMS in the name and some don't, ask the devs. Anyways, this update overhauled planets again, adding new biomes, hazards, buildings settlements, and some pretty major bug fixes too. Just a nice little variety update.

The Halloween 2020 Update - December 2023... No, obviously it's October 2020. (Idiot)
This update is another creepy one. It improved the derelict Freighters you could find, and it added Tainted Metal. Tainted Metal is a rare resource found during derelict Freighter excursions, you can use Tainted Metal to buy all sorts of spooky cosmetics and decorations for your base. You can even get your hands on a M E A T H E L M E T. nice.

The Next Generation Update - Also October 2020
This update focused on improving the game for console players. (Masterace Forever). It gave the game much better performance on consoles and also increased the max group size of multiplayer to 32. Don't expect it to load very fast though.

The Companions Update - February 2021
This update is yet another of my personal favorites. This update added the ability to tame and train creatures. You could tame a wild animal of your liking, and generation after generation manipulate the eggs to improve and alter your creatures. Now people can walk around with their 50th Generation Mr. Bubbles the space tiger and ride them at 100000000 mph. A very wholesome little update :)

The Expeditions Update - March 2021
This was a very unique update. Not only did it include many important improvements and tweaks, this update also gave rise to the Expeditions. Expeditions are limited time voyages a player can complete for permanent cosmetic rewards. The First expeditions final reward, for example, was the spaceship Golden Vector. An S-tier ship made of solid gold, and a pretty sleek design. Once you were awarded a cosmetic or even useful reward, you could visit a Quicksilver Merchant in the Nexus Hub to collect the reward on all other saves on your account. new and old. Many updates afterward featured unique Expeditions to showcase the new content.

The Prisms Update - June 2021
This update is pretty simple. They improved the visuals of the game. Space is pretty.

The Frontiers Update - September 2021
This is a pretty big update. they added new settlements that you could manage and build up. Not like your puny little base, these are big towns with citizens and everything. Now you can settle disputes between your colonists, approve and oversee construction of new buildings, and improve the infrastructure of your colony so you can start making credits by the millions.
The update also came with many improvements to your own base building capabilities, and some quality of life changes, including more save slots.

I put my fair share of time in (nearly 36 hours at time of writing). I grinded out most everything. I have fully explored several planets, maxed out inventories and travelled accross countless star systems. I spent hours simply building up language database. Do you know what i have to show for it? Nothing. it was a waste of time.

To be clear, this is a beautiful looking game, with lot's of hope and wonder, that leads to absolutely nothing. I spent hours building up resources and inventories and amassing fortunes. With nothing to do with it. All that time spent learning languages, and there was no point. Anything important story-wise, is in common language. I had much hope, waiting for something to happen. It didn't. You build random items and fuels, but that's it. You can only move from one place to another, and very little changes. Buildings are virtually identical and evenly distributed on EVERY planet. You can spot them and know exactly what they are, and what they will contain. They are unbelieveably generic. Every NPC is the same. I spent hours learning languages of a particular race. 20+ building oup relations of 1 of the 3 races, so much so i was able to decipher almost the entire language in every dialogue. Do you know what I discovered? That it didn't matter. As soon as I discovered the 2nd race, it didn't matter that I didn't know a single word. They were identical. Sure they looked different a little, but every interaction was identical. There is no point to any of the languages, they amount to nothing at all. By the time you get enough to start deciphering the exact words, what they have to say is entirely useless anyway. Did you like that outpost you were at? Too bad, you'll never find it again because navigation is terrible. But don't worry, it doesn't matter because there is another outpost that is identical, just jump in your ship and fly in any direction for less than a minute and you'll find the same damn place with a different name.

This game was like the ending of the TV Show ""Lost"", lots of buildup for a complete let down. Accumulate for no reason, talk for no reason, explore for no reason. I like a grind, but you don't even have anything to show for it. You'll never go back to wherever you were, and you'll never be able to share what you find with another human being. Cool, on this planet I'm going to name everything after memes. cool. What's the point? I'll never see that planet again when i leave for the next one. I gave this game far too much of a chance, and too much of my time. Go play minecraft, at least here you can build something. Play an MMO, at least there you can talk to someone. Go play a game with any form of campaign, at least you'll get a story. NMS is like all those games, without the things that make them great. No story, no meaningful building, no social. This feels entirely like an MMO that is empty. Accumulate wealth to buy nothing of worth, to quest with no one, and find nothing of note."

No Man's Sky has come a long way since its initial release. There's a lot to enjoy now, but there are some things I feel I need to mention to gamers like me who are reconsidering this title in 2020.

First, the good news. There is a fair amount of gameplay variety these days: running missions, space combat, building a base, and upgrading your equipment. And yes, you can now do all these things with your friends -- the game supports co-op sessions with up to 4 people.

However, the game is still, at its core, a single-player experience focused on exploring new planets and scanning alien life forms. And unfortunately, most of the other features feel like an afterthought by comparison. Some examples:

- Your progress is saved locally. If the game crashes (and it will), you will lose your progress. This is very confusing in a game that portrays itself as a persistent open world adventure.

- Your base is saved locally, and uploaded to the server periodically. If the game crashes, there is potential for major conflicts, such as two copies of your base being stacked on top of one another, which leads to permission issues and the inability to remove the old copy. Extremely frustrating. The problems compound when you try to build a base with a friend. In our squad, this was easily the most disappointing part of the game.

- Because of the local saving, it is very easy to edit your save file to load unlimited supplies and equipment. The server does NOT verify your inventory.

- There is no resource scarcity. In a game about finding and collecting resources, this feels very odd. Once you get past a certain threshold of ""units"" (the in-game currency), you can easily purchase huge quantities of items on the market, or buy a new ship to shoot NPCs with impunity. The challenge factor goes way down at that point, and consequently so does the fun.

- For all the development effort that has gone into the game of late, there seems to have been a severe lack of QA. The game crashes A LOT. Bugs abound; some are hilarious, some are infuriating.

That being said, this can still be a fun game to put 30-40 hours into with your friends. Save often. Upload your base any time you make even the smallest change. Warp throughout the galaxy, check out new planets, and marvel at the visually-impressive worlds and curious alien life forms you'll encounter.

Base building is not as good as Rust. Space combat is not as good as Elite Dangerous. The market is not player-driven as it is in EVE. The gunplay is subpar by any measure.

But No Man's Sky does all these things _pretty decently_, and the result is a fun romp around the galaxy."

(Updated at bottom)

It doesn't actually feel like a real universe, there are no planetary physics and gravity is the same on all planets. There are no actual solar systems. The planets don't rotate around a sun but are stationary, sitting together in a blob. The moons don't even go around the planets.

All of the various wonders of the universe (neutron stars, supernovas, pulsars, etc) are entirely absent. There are no stars, they're just part of the skybox but you can't fly to them.

The 18 quintillion planets that was so heavily marketed isn't impressive when you realize what that actually means: if you took 11 things and come up with 50 variations for each, that is close to 18 quintillion combinations. Most planets are entirely the same but with different bumps and colors, they have the same objects on them and largely the same resources. Once you've seen the first dozen planets, you've seen them all.

You don't have a sense of scope/scale to your journey. In the galactic map you can see other stars but there's no sense of where you are in relation to the center of the universe. Likewise you don't have a way to track where you were. No mapping or history, waypoints or other ways of tracking your progress.

The only way to travel between systems is to open up the map and click warp, which initiates a loading screen animation and loads up the new planets. There is no deep space. You feel like you're in an instance with 3 or 4 planets that are mostly the same, then you load up a new skybox with a new set of similar planets. It's nothing like say Space Engine, where you actually do get a true sense that you're in a real universe.

You can't manually land your ship, you simply press a button for it to autoland. Tons of other maneuvers (like entering a space station) are entirely autopilot. The asteroids which are everywhere have insane pop-in issues, they only show up like 50 meters in front of you.

The freight ships don't move, they just sit there passively forever. They add zero gameplay depth.

The space stations are all basically the same.

The planets are littered with outposts, all identical and with a single NPC alien standing still and staring into the wall.

The NPCs are entirely shallow, there is literally no point to even talking to them since they never say anything interesting and simply give you something random you likely don't need. Even the automated quest giving NPCs in Bethesda games that hand out those Radiant AI quests would be a massive improvement.

All of the monoliths are the same, it's nothing but a chore to chase them down. The words you learn don't add any depth to your interactions with the aliens, since they never have anything interesting to say anyway.

The animals are built on 14 different skeleton designs, with a bunch of random animal parts scrapped on top of each section to maximize the number of permutations and there is no attempt to make the animal make any sense in it's environment or have anything unique in it's behavior. The animals have no evolutionary history and their behavior is incredibly shallow.

There are no tall trees like were shown in E3, they're all saplings. There are no large forests, no large creatures. There are no large valleys, huge mountain peaks, no giant volcanos, all terrain is uniformly similar across planets.

The grinding which makes up most of the game is not only boring, but frustrating due to the completely messed up inventory management.

The interface is atrocious. It's amazing that it can be messed up this bad, the fact that we need a mod just to remove the requirement that you must hold each click for a second speaks volumes.

You need to load up a menu to do anything, and the menus are terribly designed and completely unintuitive.

The game is a technical mess. It looks like ♥ yet runs with all sorts of framerate issues.

It fails as a survival game since nothing in the game leaves you threatened. Each planet is seeded with abundant resources, and the few things that do attack you are easily defeated. Compare to minecraft where there's a very definite risk / reward system to exploring a deep cave system. Nothing really threatens you in a meaningful way.

The different minerals and resources don't really matter. Since most of the upgrades to explore the universe are yours within the first hour / two hours all the rest are kind of nice add ons.

There's no challenge to exploring. There's very little combat and what combat there is very boring.

All planets are accessible right from the start of the game. I was excited about the idea of acid planets, radioactive planets, cold planets ... I was thinking that to explore a radioactive planet you'd need to craft some special gear. There was a pretty obvious gameplay loop where the dangerous planets had better minerals/ruins/whatever but were very hard to explore. Instead every planet is basically just a copy of the others.

The constant need to recharge things, which don't really serve a purpose. It makes the game very grindy without any positive feedback. Instead of feeling free to explore the world around me I feel annoyed that if I see something cool it means 30 seconds of tedium while I mine the abundant plutonium. I end up not landing and exploring because of how annoying it is that to take off again I must enter a menu and recharge my ship.

None of the aliens interact with each other or have any sort of AI other than 'walk around a bit'.

There's nothing to sit and watch. An occasional ship will fly overhead but they don't do anything. You never really see a battle take place or the ships acting in any sort of interesting manner.

Update 2019: redacted previous points above that I thought were updated, most points are still disappointingly true. There have been add-ons like the buggies for getting around faster, base building, multiplayer (which was a promised feature from the beginning but whatever) and a few updates to the resource/crafting tree as well as a story. But the reality is that it's just a new coat of paint on a big turd.

I tried to continue from my old save file and all of my blueprints, technologies, some resources, etc. were all gone and replaced with a module called “obsolete technology.” Apparently I saved in a completely dead system cause none of the planets had anything other than sentinels and animals. No beacons, crashed ships, and incredibly scarce resources. Now I didn't have any warp cells nor the ability to craft any to escape this dead system, I couldn't even craft the visor to locate the anomaly the game constantly was telling me to go to. I asked reddit and others for help but was told that now there’s just dead systems from the update and I should just start anew. I started up a new file and threw my ship, now useless multitool, and maxed out exosuit away. So much grinding for nothing.

Turns out the only thing that makes this game challenging is the lack of upgrades, blueprints, technologies because without them grinding for materials to craft upgrades, blueprints, and technologies is super slow. They pretty much just added intermediary steps to the crafting tree (now you must refine the carbon by crafting a refiner and then finding fuel for the refiner). The added story is about as deep and interesting as mining materials. The story progresses by errand running on a galactic scale to the point that the ""characters” which send you on the errands make less and less sense. Somehow the ship controls are worse and make shooting other ships very frustrating. The only challenging part of space dogfights is the ship controls.

There’s still bugs too, a lot. You can fall through the floor of a planet or have your ship spawn under the floor, the game will crash randomly, put down a refiner and then not be able to pick it back up again or its contents.

But every 100 or so planets you visit will be pretty.

With such lack of depth and poor execution Hello Games is criminal to charge more than $10."

No Man's Sky is one of the most ADHD friendly games I've ever played. So many things to do with no time limit as to when they need to get done. When I see something shiny and end up spending hours fixating on it just to remember that I was doing something when I saw that, the other thing is still just sitting there waiting for me.

In general there is something for everyone in this game. If you're a pack rat, you can gather to and inventory manage all you want. Are you a collector? Hunt down the coolest, rarest ships to add to your collection (12 slot limit). Are you into the stock market? You can buy low and sell high with the trade mechanic. Want to learn every language? Fly from station to station asking the lifeforms to teach you their language until you uncover all their words. Each group of aliens has a back story that can be learned going through the main quest.

Though the game is vast and packed with interesting things to do; it is not without it's flaws. On PC (at least), I often find that, after a while of playing the graphics just stop rendering. Everything gets a little blurry and details just stop showing. The only way to fix the graphics issue I've found is to completely reboot the game. (This issue has since been patched and is now working correctly.)

With the new update, the ramp up to combat makes it difficult to do anything that involves getting out of your freighter or leaving a space station. Pirates attack non-stop! In the air, on the ground, if you're in your ship or not, you can expect an attack from pirates. If you happen to hit a sentinel in the process now you have pirates and sentinel after you. These fights take up way too much time and for someone just trying to survey the lands or build a new base it can be very frustrating. (This issue has since been patched and is now working/ Could still use some fine tuning, but is not unbearable any longer.)

The multiplayer mechanic could use some love. My game group and I have found that when we are all in the same game issues can arise. The space station will show that all the ships that come in belong to one person in the group. Traveling together in one freighter can cause falling through the map with an inability to get back in generally resulting in death or a need to restart their game. (We have been able to jump to another system and get one back into the ship with some jump run antics). Solid walls will not show for the guest. If they happen to go snooping they will get stuck inside the the structure with no way out and yep you guessed it a restart will be required. (this issue continues to need a lot of love).

I've found when building (especially large structures) the game has an issue remembering what you just did. Decided to change the color of a whole wall? The game will only remember some of the panels you changed. Need to fill a hole back in, It will only save some of what you filled in. I find myself doing things over and over until it remembers. You'll want to carry around a save spot and save often. ( I am not seeing this happen as often. I think the graphics rendering bug fix may have helped here as well.)

There is currently a bug that causes the settlement prompt to trigger over and over every time you step foot on a new planet if you don't already have a settlement. While this loop is happening it is difficult to complete tasks. It sometimes even stops you from getting back into your ship. If you happen to be attacked during this loop, you would be screwed. The only way to get rid of the loop is to become the overseer of a settlement. If this is not something that interests you, oh well you now own a settlement. (As I now have a settlement, I am not sure if this one has been fixed. if someone in the comments could confirm or deny?)

All in all, I love this game and find myself coming back to it over and over. I enjoy building and love that gravity is not an issue allowing for really neat builds. I easily get lost in a build. With so many material options, colors, and decorations, I can lose a few days on one build (go big or go home). No Mans Sky would be a perfect game in my eyes if they fixed the issues mentioned above.

My favorite thing is finding new systems that no one has been to and renaming everything. If you are the first to discover, the game allows you to rename the system, planets, flora, fauna and minerals. You are also able to rename every ship you acquire along with your freighter, multi-tools, exocrafts, and pets.

I personally have not done an expedition and so have no opinion on that. (Sorry)

I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys free roam exploration, interesting pet options, awesome looking spaceships, base building, trading, space battles, geography, city management, collecting/hording, and so much more!"

No Man's Sky used to be overrated and is now underrated, this game is one of the most tragic stories of any videogame that ever existed. At the start, the game was laggy and bad and didn't have multiplayer so it got a lot of bad reviews. But, weirdly enough, developers continued making updates and now is one of the best games I ever played. An awesome game that has multiplayer, missions, pets, nice NPCs, spaceships and spaceship upgrades, exocraft, monsters etc. The universe in this game is infinite and it is constantly expanding making random planets that makes this game never get old. The coding behind this game makes it only a few gigabytes small with pretty small loading times. It still has bugs here and there but the way things are going I think they will patch all of it.

Let's be real. This game was awful at launch. However...

Hello Games have really turned it around, with large, content rich updates which to this day remain regular and FREE. They could have easily taken the money and disappeared, released paid expansions or implemented MTX. Instead, they built upon the game. Creating a fun, engaging and beautiful experience.

There is something deeply satisfying about warping to a new star system and exploring all of its planets and moons, that few games capture in the same way that No Man's Sky does."

Honestly not a bad game. at launch it was a little barren but was still kinda fun to just sail the solar systems, but with aaaall the stuff brought with the updates, now including multiplayer, its easily worth the original pricetag. and if you're mad that you basically got a early access title at supposed ""launch"", remember that 99% of any other game devs would've chocked it up as a loss and worked on No Man's Sky 2, but these guys actually worked tirelessly for years under extreme scrutiny and prejudice to bring us a game worth our quid, *and they're still updating*.

No Man's Sky is an...interesting situation.

First impressions are everything for a game, and No Man's Sky gave quite a first impression for sure. Pre-launch, No Man's Sky promised to be the game literally everybody dreams about. Touting quintillions of planets, each randomly generated and different from the last, with random creatures, plants, and geology. No Man's Sky was looking too good to be true, and that was absolutely the case at launch.

Nearly every feature advertised in the trailers, interviews, and pre-launch material was missing. Instead, there was a boring husk of a game, with boring planets and same-y fauna.

Then there was the first major patch - Foundation. Foundation added basebuilding similar to subnautica, a survival mode, farming, freighters, and a whole host of quality of life improvements

Then there was the second patch - Pathfinder. Pathfinder added vehicles, base sharing, permadeath mode, more starships, new shops, and even more content. The game was still early, but the groundwork was there.

The Atlas Rises update added a story mode, new planet types, missions and so much more. It fixed major issues with the UI and QOL improvements. It was shaping up to something

Then there was NEXT. NEXT is the update that truly changed NMS for the better. Multiplayer, unlimited base building, community reasearch, third person mode, character customization, and so much more.

Then came two smaller, but still substantial updates, Abyss and Visions. Abyss focused on improving undersea wildlife, and made the underwater sections of the game look beautiful. Visions added variation to planets, trophies, carniverous plants, and improved the visual fidelity.

No Man's Sky was a complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ failure at launch. But that's simply not the case any more. Hello Games has proven that it's possible to redeem something thought to be unredeemable. They made the biggest dissapointment of 2016 into a fully fleshed game, and it's only getting better with time.

I don't think NMS is worth 60 dollars. Not yet. I paid 30, and I don't regret my purchase.

No Man's Sky is, in my opinion, a good game. There is still much to wait for, but I say it is worth the purchase now."

Honest (2020) Review, (From the mind of a simple critic) Industrial Gamers!

Gameplay. This game offers you to be whatever you want to be from the start. The main/side quest helps players learn things about the game and unlocks useful items. All 100% up to you to decide whether or not you wish to pursue them.

Graphics. The amount of visual overhauls this game recieves with each update is crazy. And on top of that their ""Next Generation"" update is arriving soon. I'm astonished how they can keep making an already beautiful game look even better!

Controls. Absolutely 100% Simple. 2 hours in you'll master the quick menu as well.

Sound. This game is FILLED with ambient sounds, pair that with the relaxing music that overlaps it and you have the recipe for one relaxing game to take your mind off of things.

Difficulty. When you start you will hit a learning curve. The game offers so many items and on top of that it's own periodic table, it's kindof hard to keep track of it all. Besides that, npc difficulty isn't much of a threat after you get the hang of the game.

Final Rating - I vote this game the ""LABOR OF LOVE AWARD"" every year for a reason. They stood up against a community and said we won't give up until we give you the game we promised! They've given that and MORE. Much respect to Sean Murray and his team, can't wait to see what other project you all have in store for the future!"

2022 Review

So, everyone knows the rocky history of this game. This review is for the latest version after the Polestar and Endurance updates. Honestly, I feel like the devs have finally delivered on a lot of their promises. This is a fantastic game for those who like to explore and don't want to worry about combat as much.

Pros:
- Infinite worlds to explore with an insane amount of randomness
- The views in this game are stunning
- Fairly seamless loading
- Variety of ships, freighters, pets to collect
- Easy combat if you just want to explore
- Base building on planets works really good
- Base building on freighter is very convenient but there are some bugs currently (bugged refiners)
- Settlements are a fun addition and have potential
- The game is relaxed

Cons
- Still some major bugs that haven't been fixed for YEARS
- Early game inventory, resource, money management can be a pain (I'm an inventory hoarder)
- Combat has very little variety
- Guild & race rankings don't do anything
- The mission board system needs some work, better rewards, & bug fixes
- Some things are time-locked for silly reasons (the living ship missions are the best example)
- 99% of all dialog from NPCs & terminals is nonsense meant to drip-feed you ""lore"" through sentence fragments. There isn't an easy way to skip dialog either.
- The only ""unique"" NPCs exist on the Nexus. ALL other NPCs are clones and have the same personalities.

Overall, I would say this is a great game but expect bugs. My 8-year-old daughter watches & plays this with me sometimes and really likes exploring and finding creatures. The limited combat is easy and still rewarding. The RNG variety of worlds / flora / fauna is mind-blowing. If you are looking for an action-shooter THIS IS NOT THE GAME FOR YOU. If you want an amazing space game to explore that is not punishing, then this is for you.

Overall 8/10"

Probably the biggest redemption in the videogame history.

You have many things to craft and do right now, missions can get repetitive but for example, i spent 25h+ just building, expanding and upgrading my base.
Played some co-op missions and free exploration which made it even more fun.

I watched this video and 30 seconds after the video ended I bought the game, so If you have some doubts, give it a try.
Definitely worth on sale.

I have got to say this game was a complete and utter failure when it launched. So much hype for nothing. But, a ray of hope as the devs pulled themselves together and shot through the darkness of that shadow of doubt everyone cast on you. How did they do that?
By adding MASSIVE updates and fixes to the game. Much more content and is still growing!

So I pre-ordered this.

At the time, when I first played it, I came to regret that as a mistake. I sank a couple hours in here and there, but I just couldn't get into it. The story felt dull, the landscapes were just... off, and it just wasn't what was advertised.

I cast it aside, too late to refund.

Base building came out, along with vehicles, creative mode, and a camera. I played around with them, and they were fun - but the survival still felt lackluster. Creative mode got boring fast, and the camera (probably one of my favourite game features at the time) was hardly worth going into the game to use just for screenshots.

And now, after the Waking Titan ARG - we have Atlas Rises.
To be honest - I'm impressed. Suddenly, I find myself wanting to play survival because it's fun. Hell, I find myself wanting to play the game itself because I enjoy it now, not because I'm bored and need to sink time into something. The story is interesting and I want to see more, dozens of tiny little things that weren't there suddenly are...
It's a new experience.

In all honesty, I would have much preferred to see the game in this state on release. That way I would have been spared a year of disappointment. Hello Games has done what few developers would have done after the disaster of the release, and has spent time and effort making this game into something they can be proud of. It's clear they believe in the potential of No Man's Sky, and I find that inspiring.

I can finally, in good conscience, recommend this game.
I think the price is still too steep - but I would recommend it on half price."

A hard-earned positive review. From abysmal beginnings and broken promises, to a display of loyalty to their users that is simply beyond the comprehension of most AAA publishers. This is the redemption arc we hope that other botched releases aspire to.

Not only is the base game now exceptional, but the consistency of *free* major updates is admirable. It seems that every time I've dropped in on this game, there's been some cool new mechanic or item class to play with. A living world like this is rare to see in something that isn't bogged down in SaaS economics and microtransactions, especially given that the game can be played in an entirely single-player environment if you so wish.

Yeah, they screwed up. But oh man they sure fixed it good too. Labour of love indeed. ♭

I've had my eye on No Man's Sky for the longest time but just couldn't get myself to buy it before because of all the bad press. I finally decided to jump in when the Origins update was launched and let me just say WOW!! While all the criticism when the game first launched back 2016 was probably well deserved, the state of the game as it is right now makes it seem like a completely different game.

Before you jump in as well though it's important to understand that the main focus of this game, at least in my opinion, is exploration. It's completely non-linear, you can play without ever touching the story quests and you'll get by just fine or you can decide to follow the story line to try to answer the questions regarding the creation of the universe.

Among the many, many things you can do, you could focus on creating the base of your dreams, colonizing a planet or if your ambitions are big enough you could also make en entire solar system your home. Maybe you're someone who likes to have nice things and you'll go hunting for the coolest ship, the strongest weapons, a kickass freighter or pimp out all of your vehicles You could have battles in space with your starship, become a space pirate and loot other freighters. You could dedicate yourself to farming resources for construction or trade, or maybe you're more into wildlife and wanna discover the most exotic, bizarre creature in the universe... the possibilities really are endless with this game and weather you go out and explore on your own or with friends, only you are in control of your fate in the universe.

One of the things that surprised me most about this game is the sheer size of it. You start out on a single planet that forms part of a single solar system with multiple planets/moons. That solar system is just one of possibly millions of like systems that form up a single galaxy... and as you may have imagined, that galaxy is just one of many galaxies, each with it's own cluster of millions of solar systems and practically infinite planets to explore. Of course due to limitation of technology after a while you'll start to notice some similarities between planets, but the developers work very hard to make sure that each system is different and unique in some way, shape or form.

Visually this game is beautiful and the soundtrack, while not overly noticeable, sets a good mood for the game. The next-gen patch that was recently announced will only build up on that and we can expect to see another huge improvement to the aesthetics within each world. Some other things to look out for in the future are reworks to the cave systems and sub-aquatic worlds. While present in the game currently, they do leave a lot to be desired and I'm sure that the developers will expand on this in the near future. Hello Games may have had a rough start, but they're dedicated to make this game better and better, and I have high hopes that they will continue to build on this already great game.

Long story short, I absolutely recommend this game. I understand that it may not be for everyone, but if any of the things I mentioned before seem to interest you then this game is definitely for you. No Man's Sky is at a really good place right now and it will only keep getting better, it really has been the comeback of the century and I for one will be sticking around for the long run to see how far we can go from here."

1: The freedom in this game is spectacular. You can go from planet to planet mining and exploring. There's an upside and a downside to this however, and I will address it more in the dislike section.
2: I like how you can modify not only your weapon but you can modify your exosuit and starship/freighter as well. In order to do so, it takes time and thought into what materials you will need for each upgrade/item.
3: The ability to grow in the game regarding upgrades and learning new tech is amazing, and I love how every time I play I have the chance to learn something new about the game.
4: They are still updating this game and I don't see any reason why they should stop either. As long as it keeps drawing in players I think this game will stick around for awhile.

-Dislikes-
1: Addressing #1 in likes: most of the planets feel the same. I understand that the scope of this game is so complex that it would require a ton of memory and data on the developers part in order to make each and every planet unique. With that said, they did do a good job with keeping the planets some-what unique. I would like to see some updates in the future that have more combative alien types along with some new playable species as well.
2: One of the biggest disappointments for me was the fact that when you do modify and upgrade your starship/freighter, you don't see the results on the outside of the ship. For example, when I add a rocket launcher on my ship the ship should reflect that modification and show it somewhere on the ship itself. The biggest reason I started playing this game was for the starships and exploration, so needless to say, it was a little disappointing when I found out that ship doesn't change at all when I add new weapons and gear. The only way to change the look of your ship is to buy a different looking ship.

That's it for now. I'll have more to come later."

No Man's Sky for me is more than a game, it will be my life-time memories. I played with my brother and we had so much fun and our adventures were such trills.

My brother passed away last month with Covid-19.

Miss you bro, hope you will still be playing NMS from heaven or other planets that you've always dreamed of living."

Hello Games is doing exactly what other developers and publishers should be doing, offering a full game that they support and make right even after a bumpy release. I only purchased this game recently, almost 3 years after release, but I did so because the developers keep pumping out high quality content for free. That sort of behavior needs to be rewarded in this current EA/Bethesda micro transaction, horse armor, overpriced DLC, random box of crap unlock, nightmare of a gaming world that we find ourselves in.

I really enjoy this game; there is a lot of fun activity and it is good value for the cost."

This game is not a shooter, not a simulation, not an open world crafter, not an rpg and for very sure it is not action packed in any way. It is an exploration game. It is exactly what it says it is.
If you are missing the mindset of an explorer than this game is not for you.

Is it repetitive? Ofc it is, it is impossible to fill 255 entire galaxies with new and ever refreshing content. It is procedural generated, so things have to repeat at some point. Is Battlefield repetitive? Or Minecraft? Or Fifa? Or The Hunter? Hell yes, they are as repetitive as a game could be. Are they boring? Some say yes, some say no. Yet be assured that they are successful for a good reason. Sames for NMS.

Has it bugs? I'd lie if I'd say it hasn't. But I'd also lie if I'd say the bugs would be awefully annoying, gamebreaking or overly prevalent. It's a huge game with a lot of procedures that can go wrong. That's how free2explore-games are. Period.

Is it abandoned? Neither by the devs, nor by the players. The game received 3 pretty big updates last year with a lot of new content. The community is huge and the most helpful, kind and well behaved... of basically all communities I know so far. Never have i received hate mail, was bullied with ingame mechanics, met a griefer or a cheater etc etc. Yes, there are people using glitches to duplicate items, trick the basebuilding system and stuff like that. And the community knows that those people exist. Because those people are active members of the community and they are as welcome as everyone. There is not a single competitive aspect in the game. If you want to glitch yourself rich: Sure. Do whatever you like. There is no advantage to gain and therefor no one you could hurt. Play the game you want.

Is it fun? Well, does it sound fun to travel from planet to planet searching for something without knowing what that something is? Does it sound fun to feel alone in space? Does it sound fun to play a game that wants you to feel alone? Seeking a purpose? Does it sound fun to play something that basically asks the same question like real life? If that sounds good to you: Welcome to No Man's Sky!"

This game got SO much better. The rating for the game will take a while to improve, but if Hello keeps it up, it will eventually go up. The game today is far different than the pre-order days, and they did a good job making up for the fact that they put out an unfinished game, that didn't deliver on the promises made.

When it was released: 3/10 - 4/10
As it stands today: 8/10"

I'm not fully done with the game and I would love to play it again if I have the time for it!

Introduction:
Ah, No Man's Sky... a beautiful, free roaming space exploration game with unlimited or over 18 quintillion planets for you to visit. Why the unlimited? you might ask? Well, I'm not going to visit all of them in my lifetime sitting!

""I'm not alone in this... this is a multiplayer, right?""
~ Me, in August of 2016, after getting off the biggest hypetrain ride ever in history and buying the game in full.

The release:
No Man's Sky is a Space Exploration, Sandbox game with a very... very... VERY... bad start. For starters it was a barren, bug-riddled, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ excuse of an AAA game I've- sorry; WE'VE ever witnessed, don't you agree? We were all there at the release, we stepped all out of the same platform of the hypetrain station all to see God awful, buggy, unoptimised sack of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of a game with little to nothing to do!

You started off with a waking-up-from-a-slumber kind of situation were your spacesuit is booting up, and while that dramatic sequence is rolling to bring some effect to your following gameplay you'll see your that your spaceship is not the only thing that is broken... it seriously looked like a alpha version of the game. Grass glitches, discoloration, random flashes like it's the Matrix...

Want to change some specs at the game settings? Crash. Want to take the first steps in this undiscovered planet? Crash. Want to beam down your laser onto a creature that looks funny? Crash. Want manage your inventory? Crash. Want to say a bad word after the experience? Karma: Crash. Want to compliment the Developers at something they made was actually astonishing? Crash; and taking it back. Want to boot up the game one more time after so many crashes? Crash.

And after that ONE last crash the game wouldn't even want to start up properly, giving me an error. Looking at the time spend on the game; more than 2 hours, making it impossible to refund. And it's just been sitting in my library for the longest time unable the play. After that ruckus I was really amazed that this game thought me one thing and ONE thing only and it really opened my eyes for future games to be released:


This game really haunted my every future move on investing in games. A game that has been falsely advertised on every promising aspect but no actual amendments. Interviews of simple, straightforward questions all being answered as lies. LIES!

The only thing that was highly unnecessary of the community (not all!) is making bomb and death treads, not only on social media but in front of their office as well. Very childish and very inappropriate! A matter of time in court was all it could take, no need for (verbal) violence! Shame to those people!

A very bad start indeed. After so many angry people demanding their money back and not leaving Hello Games alone. But there was a spark of hope, they only needed to follow their heart. Is it the money, or putting smiles on people's faces they're after? Only time could tell you.





Okay things are looking up, but what about the bu-





Okay, we are all very happy with these updates rolling left and right, I think we're all satisf-

















And it doesn't stop there! It seems to never stop with updates that are FREE for us to download. Normally a game company would make us a DLC to buy separately from the game, but not in No Man's Sky! Back in August 2016 it wasn't as we hoped it be, but Hello Games stepped up and never gave up the hope. What started out as a small team has a thriving and flourishing full team of people with the same dream as Shawn: To make an exploration in space game to never forget and live in the experience. Bringing the people joy for their hard work."

Maybe it's because I'm not extremely far into the game yet... but I'm really having a hard time seeing why people think this game is shallow after nearly 6 years. In the roughly 14 hours of my current save, I've managed to do the following:

- Build a small, somewhat crude, yet efficient base of operations
- Defeat pirates and rescue a freighter ship
- Meet a sentient red orb and join its cult
- Join the resistance against that same cult
- Find a magical teleporting Death Star with a bunch of social outcasts (who defy the laws of physics)
- Defeat a bunch of robots because I want treasure
- Begin learning four different in-universe languages (which actually changes the dialogue of the NPCs over time into coherent sentences)
- Discover new planets, animal species, plant life, and weird mineral formations
- Help some dudes named after Greek gods after stealing one of their identities
- Went through a black hole
- Bribe alien civilizations into liking me by giving them presents and poorly speaking their native tongue

And there's a LOT more that I can do that I haven't even started exploring yet, like vehicle building, ship collecting, building massive bases with different farming complexes, link together different portals on planets, become a bounty hunter, smuggle goods, kill a bunch of zerglings...

Seriously, this game has a LOT of content. Don't buy into the idea that the game is ""as wide as an ocean, and as deep as a puddle"", because that ignores the multiple different storylines, in-universe lore and languages, and simple yet deeply fun gameplay mechanics."

I was one of those people that bought this game when it first released, was very disappointed and shelved it after maybe 3 hours of gameplay. Decided to give it another go last week and my god am I glad I did. This game is amazing and definitely worth the €60,- I payed for it years ago. Sure, it's a shame it took so long but if you're looking through the reviews to see if it's worth your money, it definitely is.

If anyone associated with Hello Games happens to read this: You've made true on your promises and we're good in my book."

I have been playing video games since the 70's, long before home video game consoles, but no game has been able to capture my attention as No Man's Sky, to be able to live a virtual life as a space explorer has been a dream of mine for years, this game is jam packed with missions and things to do and the Devs have been on the ball to keep upgrading the game and making it better. Come visit my base at FACE-SUNSET-BALLOON-BUG-SUNSET-ECLIPSE-VOXEL-GALAXY-TREE-ECLIPSE-BOAT-TENT there is over 13 million in units waiting for you there. Keep up the great work No man's Sky Devs. I salute you! this game was money well spent!!"

Okay... I have logged over 2200 hours playing this game... so I feel like I am justified in giving a review of this game. First and foremost... this is a survival game the is the foundational driver for what you initially do. However, it quickly evolves into an exploration and investment style methodology. in plan language, you have to do a series of things to survive and then thrive, then explore, then gather, build, and enjoy. The variety of life, planets, etc are huge... but not unlimited. You will see variations on a theme... and sometimes it gets somewhat repetitive (or at least it seems)... but then you find that completely DIFFERNT world or creature or mixture of environments that are just amazing. I have played games like ARK... huge fan... this is very similar... as in ARK in space. I love the various aspects... let me just pick one... bases. You can have a simple home on any planet you choose... multiple in fact. Then you can build very complex bases... anywhere... underwater to the top of mountains to underground. You can now manage settlements as well as having your own bases. You can obtain a freighter (capital ship) and build your mobile base there... you launch and store your ships (up to 6) on your capital ship. I cannot emphasize enough the practical and amazing beauty of the game... specifically the multitude of environments. Can you play with people? Yes definitely you can play with a friend or friends. Can you run quests together... the answer is sorta of... but generally, it is better to run quests (unless specifically stated as group oriented) alone. Are there bugs... some for sure... in a game this HUGE and COMPLEX... there are bugs but Hello Games has done a fantastic job in meretriciously fixing and addressing them (not all... but they have not stopped). Can you have pets? Yes... up to 6. Can you modify their DNA through modification of their eggs... the answer is YES. Can you cook... yes. Can you build... absolutely - think Fallout 76, ARK, as examples. Can you fight first person or in ships... the answer is yes... mainly against NPCs... but there is somewhat of a pvp aspect... but not really. Ultimately, if you are not playing permadeath, your death has really no penalty other than you need to go back and pickeup your stuff where you died. No one can really truly steal from you in this game... they can take the things you harvest off of a harvester (resource wise) but it will be available to you when you come to it (as if no one touched it). Thus, there are NO base defenses per se like turrets. There is no need. Can pets protect you from other animals... yes they sure can. Can other NPCs help you in space battles... the answer is yes they do. Hopefully this quick overview and random aspects was helpful to someone. I truly love this game and you will find that there are very generous players that will give you literally the shirt off their backs to help you. Best of luck and happy exploring if you get this game!"

For Those Who TL:DR

Pros:
- Vivid 1970's styles and visuals almost as if it was out of a Sci-Fi art book.
- Procedurally generated worlds, far more then a person can possibly explore in a life time.
- Great procedurally mixed music, performed by 65daysofstatic.
- Can own up to 6 ships and a colossal capital ship with up to 30 escort frigates.
- Exocraft for land and sea (don't have to always walk everywhere)
- Base building
- Co-op Play (up to 4 players)
- Few bugs a seen as of this writing.

Cons:
- Not much story
- Very repetitive structures
- Side quests are largely repetitive.
- Can't sell ships once you have the maximum (you can trade them for others though).
- Game can feel a little bit repetitive at times.

Ideas/Suggestions for the Developer:
- The ability to sell ships
- Build your own Space Station
- Upgrade ships and freighter cargo in a discovered ship yard similar to how exo suits are upgraded.
- Upgrades for the suit to survive space and be able to space walk with thrusters and magnet boots on freighters and frigates.
- Discover procedurally generated tombs, pyramids, structures, monuments, dungeons, etc as well as the current monoliths. Just more diversity in structures to discover.
- For wealthy systems, procedurally generated vast explorable cities with a massive space port maybe capable of landing freighters. And perhaps owning your own shop to sell resources and warehouses for those resources. Something else to do in between exploring.


Review for those who read:

No Man's Sky is a marvel of mathematic procedural engineering. The algorithm uses fractal formulas that are observed in the real world/universe. Texuring, models, music, everything running from a single procedural 16 bit seed (a phone number no less). With 18(10)^10 planets, spread across 255 galaxies, to visit. If you were to visit each planet, each second, it would take you 570,000,000,000 years, approximately 42 times the age of the universe. This is a big game, but I digress. This review isn't just about how technically impressive the game is.

The art is vivid and colorful, all inspired by the art of Sci-Fi artists of the 70's and 80's, such as Ralph McQuarrie, Paul Lehr, Bob Eggleton, and John Berkey. The picturesque vistas, the styles of the ships, and the colorful nebula/gas clouds (even one system apparently is in an all blinding red gas cloud) inspire the need to explore.

No Man's Sky is a procedurally generated sandbox where you explore solar systems and planets. It has a light story arc and generated side quests. NMS isn't scripted like many games and due to the vast scale scale of the universe no in game story could be big enough. Although it wouldn't hurt to have something like a 100 hour plot for the game but that would detract from what the game is actually about, exploration.

Being basically an exploration sandbox, every planet is different and is generally a fresh new experience each time. NMS has a little bit for almost everyone. You can go after bounties, be a space pirate and attack freighters for resources, base building, economy play (no where near the extent of EVE) and co-op play.

Despite the technical achievement, visuals, and exploration aspects. There are a few things that NMS falls short. Being procedural, the game can be very samey. Each planet will generate procedurally on a fractal formula which will fallow similar repeated patterns for most systems (I mean com'on, it's a planet, it's going to have creatures, plants, terrain, and a sky). No planet or star system is exactly the same but will always feel a little similar and familiar. A lot of the structures found on a planet's surface are largely the same, follow similar patterns and offer very little variety. I tend to feel a bit bored after a while seeing the same structures over and over again. I want to discover strange new alien structures explorable with treasures in them and see vast sprawling procedurally generated cities with massive space ports, which I'm surprised aren't added for wealthy systems.

Regardless of the patterning for an average planet, there are planets with absurd if not drug induced features. There are planets with floating land masses, vast oceans, strange objects scattered across the land, and in my experience I found a planet with pink landscape, a purple sky and nothing but dancing mushrooms as lifeforms. Also I found a planet that was nothing but a boiling, acidic, toxic ocean.

Whatever you choose to get out of this game, whether it is to explore the vast number of systems, or attempt to travel to each galaxy. No Man's Sky is an overall great experience.

Personally, I waited a while to get this game due to its rocky launch, but it has grown and changed since then. The developer, Hello Games, is still adding free content and features. It's not quite it's $60 (USD) price tag but hopefully with future improvements and updates it will be worth so much more then that. As of now I recommend getting it on sale, as I did."
