I genuinely enjoy the game, but I feel that it is morally incorrect to recommend the game to others and downright evil to recommend the game to friends. The game itself is fun, and the skills and combat can feel very satisfying. Each of the many jobs offers a different play-style so players have some options with how they want to interact with the game.

The problem is that the game feels fun and inviting at first, but as soon as you start thinking ""Wow, I like this character, I wanna see how far I can go with it,"" Nexon has already won.

First, you have to get a character from level 1 to level 200. This will take a few days at first, but each character you do this with will take a shorter amount of time to reach level 200. If the first climb to level 200 already felt too grindy, I recommend stopping immediately because it will get much, much worse.

Each of the different jobs have a special skill called a ""Link Skill."" For some job, these link skills have only 2 levels. Getting level 1 in a link skill requires getting the character to level 70, and getting level 2 in a link skill requires getting the character to level 120. Some characters have a third level to their link skill which is gained at level 210.

Link skills are special in that they can be transferred or ""linked"" to another one of your characters in the same world. The character that the link skill comes from always has that link skill active whether it's linked to another character or not.

So if there is more than one job that you enjoy, you can have those characters give each other some link skills to make them a bit stronger. You may swap out link skills among your many characters up to 10 times per day, but after changing out a particular link skill 3 times, you have to spend some in-game currency if you want to swap that skill another 1 to 7 times.

Another mechanic of the game is called ""Legion."" You're given a special board called the Legion board, which looks like, and is, a large grid. You're also given a number called your legion rank. Your legion rank is equal to the combined total of all your levels on each character in a particular world. As you level up a character, its levels are added to your legion rank. Additionally, at certain level thresholds, you are given a ""legion block"" that represents that particular character. These blocks look like and work similarly to Tetris pieces.

These blocks can occupy a number of spaces on the legion board depending on the character's level. At level 60 a block can occupy one space, at level 100 a block can occupy two spaces, at level 140 a block can occupy three spaces, at level 200 a block can occupy four spaces, and at level 250 a block can occupy five spaces.

The legion board has spaces that grant stats when legion blocks are placed on them. So, for example, if you place a block with a size of 3 in the ""Str"" or ""Strength"" region of the board, each of your characters on that world will gain a flat +3 str or strength to their stats. Additionally, each character provides its own legion bonus that also depends on the number of spaces that it takes up on the board. For example, a Hero class will give a flat +10, +20, +40, +80, and +100 strength at levels 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively.

""Flat"" means that the stats gained aren't affected by any other modifiers.

Each of these legion ""bonuses"" that a particular character provides can only be gained once. So if you get two Hero classes to 100, the strength bonuses from that particular class won't stack and will only be counted once.

So now that I've taken the time to explain Link Skills and Legion, why should these systems matter with whether or not the game should be played?

Here's the problem: Reaching ""endgame"" or somewhere close to it in this game essentially means getting every possible class to either level 200 or level 210. Level 200 when the character has a level 2 link skill, and level 210 when the character has a level 3 link skill. This is to get every character to provide at four spaces minimum on the legion board while also getting every link skill to its maximum level.

Levels 200+ are usually considered to be where ""real game"" starts nowadays, and pushing just a single character from 200 to 250 takes considerable effort, to the point where getting a level 5 legion block with every character could be considered a lifetime achievement.

Getting a character beyond 250 (the level cap is currently 300) is generally only feasible with about 3-4 characters at best, so most a lot of emphasis is placed on about 1-2 characters, which are a player's ""mains.""

You need to get every character to 200 or 210 in order to funnel the majority of your time, energy, and resources into one single character.

And that's all before mentioning that most of the content is massively time-gated, enhancing equipment to be suitable for late-game or end-game is ""pay-to-win"" in regular worlds, and cosmetics you buy with REAL MONEY from the cash shop only last 90 DAYS. That's right, you don't get to keep the digital cosmetics that you spent money on.

You CAN get permanent cosmetics by purchasing and opening the ""Surprise Style Boxes"" (SSBs) in the cash shop, but it's completely random which cosmetic equipment you'll get. You could potentially spend hundreds and not get the cosmetics that you want from a particular ""SSB"" rotation. The same thing goes for royal hair and face coupons. If there's a particular hairstyle or face style you want and it's listed on a royal hair/face coupon? Gotta roll for it.

I play the game because I don't mind grinding and sometimes even enjoy it while listening to music. It's something I kinda do mindlessly when I want to relax for a while.

I love the lore of this game and I'm usually excited to learn new bits of info about it. The story and writing is often cheesy and silly, but I think that's part of its charm. The music in this game can be repetitive, but personally I don't really get tired of it and find some tracks to be relaxing and/or awesome. The combat can be very satisfying and a lot of fun. The game makes you feel powerful as you take down swarms and swarms of enemies per attack.

I think the game itself is fine and even enjoyable and fun. There's simply no other 2d game, or mmo that feels quite like maplestory, and that's why some players find it to be so difficult to leave. There are parts of it that I love and genuinely enjoy, but it's plagued by subtle and extremely predatory monetization practices and a company that goes to any lengths that it can to exploit and take advantage of the player-base. Nexon simply does not care about the players in the slightest, and tries to pretend that they care whenever something happens that might affect the money they're making.

To summarize: It's a great game plagued by a terrible company and terrible pay-to-win practices, and getting further and further in the game requires exponential levels of grinding.

I feel I must re-iterate that I feel that to recommend this game to others is to subject them to the same issues that the current player-base is dealing with and as such would be morally questionable.

Recommending the game a friend and having that friend actually get into and enjoy the game might end up ruining their life with the levels of grinding this game requires, and as such I think to do that to a friend would be downright evil.

If you read all this and think you'd be fine with it, then proceed, but again I CANNOT and WILL NOT recommend this game to others.

Enter at your own risk."

Just don't.
I know you're a veteran, but the game you once loved is gone.

Enjoy a dying buggy game with unbelievable server issues, plagued by a skeleton crew of a company operating on the soul purpose of exploiting you for your nostalgia.

You wanna progress? Fork over thousands of dollars, or spend literal years to try and catch up to people still doing years old content because they don't add any catch up mechanics outside of trashy events that are usually just copy paste of the same ♥♥♥♥ with a slightly different flavor.

The literal only reason there are still players is because of sunk cost fallacy and addiction.

IF you don't want to fort over the thousands of dollars to even begin the game on regular servers, you can choose to play on reboot and deal with the most annoying RNG filled trash systems without any ability to trade, so you're forced to grind for years to hit what some people would consider to be late game. It's a mobile game on steroids.

I have a thousand hours on steam, but probably 4x that on the Nexon launcher over the years. I'm still not even in the late game. Hell, I'd say I'm closer to being in the mid game still. No thanks.

I just got word from my old guild discord that they have the audacity to charge $100.00 (ONE HUNDRED) dollars for an in game pet, then on top of the $100.00 charge, they have the audacity to charge $15.00 MONTHLY just to use the thing.
""But why would anybody pay so much money for a pet? That's insane.""
Because this pet vacuums up all the items and money on the floor, increasing your efficiency. So if you want to have any chance of keeping up with the whales you gotta fork over the cash on both your main, and most likely you will want a Kanna alt so you gotta fork it up on that character too.

I do not recommend this game. I wouldn't even consider this a game, it's just a glorified gambling simulator, where you don't just gamble with your wallet, you do it with your time on top of that."

Nexon ruined Maplestory. My account got hacked and after contacting support on two separate occasions, I was told this was why it was banned and it wouldn't be unbanned. I was then told by support, ""Continued appeal to this account will be considered abuse of our support system, and may result in the removal of your ability to contact us.""

If you haven't already been playing this game for years don't bother picking it up. It is absolutely not fit for new players who aren't willing to put in hours upon hours of out of game research and even more hours of grinding to get to even an early game level. You will spend many hours getting your first character to level 200-205 and then realize that this character is worthless without 7-8 more characters getting to level 120 for a few decent link skills and then even more to 140 so that you can start building up legion. Most of the bosses you unlock getting to level 200 are borderline not doable without first getting a boss carry to get the gear that they drop to even do enough damage to start contributing in boss fights that drop the gear that you need. They set the game up to almost require boss carries but are currently testing out nerfs to the boss carry system as an extra ♥♥♥♥ you to its players. The game design is entirely based around grinding for low drop chance items from weekly bosses and mesos used to buy cubes to make that gear better along with an upgrade system designed to destroy your rare items to force you to grind again. Nexon is entirely out of touch with its community and makes stupid wide reaching changes on a whim even after explicitly stating that they wont (ie: totem removal). Nexon is consistently saying that players are progressing too fast compared to how long they think progress should take and start making changes to make the game even worse and grindier They are completely willing to neuter classes for no reason and remove many BiS items from the game making them completely unobtainable for anybody but veteran players who happened to pick it up before the removal. I genuinely believe that Nexon dislikes its community to a point where it is actively trying to drive players from its game by constantly making ♥♥♥♥♥♥ changes that make the overall player experience worse. I used to love this game I have so many fond memories of playing growing up and Nexon has done everything in its power to piss on those memories and make the game completely unrecognizable. ♥♥♥♥ you Nexon

Edit: Nexon just announced today that they are outright removing the Jett class from the game entirely. Jesus ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Christ Nexon are you purposely killing any tiny shred of good will you had from your community by displacing thousands of characters and people who loved this class? I guarantee whatever compensation they have for this change wont even come close to matching the time and effort Jett mains have spent leveling and gearing their characters. But let me guess 100 free nodestones and 100 free symbols that will hold them over. ♥♥♥♥ YOU AGAIN Nexon"

For claification sake, I've played this game since Beta and I love the overall animation and playstyle imaged as a 2D platformer. I guess this really hit a nostalgia nerve for me and my yearning for the old Mario Brothers mechanics. And while I hate to bash something I fell in love with, this is no longer the game that I use to know.

Back in the early days of MapleStory, you had your 4 standard classes: Mage, Warrior, Archer, Thief. Mage and Warrior had 3 subsets each; Archer and Thief had 2 subsets. Finding equipment and hanging out with friends was easy because there was just a few servers and not that many maps. The level cap was set as a crazy 200, but the mindless grinding wasn't so bad, cause you could easily be with your friends and if you found an equip you couldn't use, one of them could and vice versa.

But Maplestory grew. On the surface, you would think this is a good thing; more people = more friends = more equips. True, but Nexon saw this as an excellent opportunity to milk its players through microtransactions.

As the game grew, Nexon built more servers and maps, creating virtual spacial rifts between players. It became more and more difficult to get to the same map as a friend without using a teleport rock (a microtransaction item) or wasting a bunch of time. Nexon created pets, vanity items, world transfers, shops; all for real money. When that wasn't enough, they created more character types, those who couldn't share the cash shop items with the original characters, essentially urging players to rebuy cash items. The new characters also lead to the nerfing of some of the original characters under the guise of ""improved"" for rebalancing issues. Nexon raised the level cap to 250, milking players for even longer. They created a lottery system called gachapon for in-game items using real money, not to mention special event ""lotteries"".

Don't play Maplestory. It's not what it use to be. The fun is sucked out of it. Don't waste tons of time and money on it like I did."

MapleStory was one of the first MMORPG titles I've had the chance of playing, besides Runescape Classic (which was a looong time ago).

After a revisit of this game (after many years of on and off playing), as well as THOUSANDS of dollars spent, I cannot say I am willing to recommend this game.

FIrstly, MapleStory is one of the few 2D side-scrolling MMORPGs that try to mix 'cute' and 'breathtaking' together, and at times, they do it very well. Some landscapes are huge, the original lore and locations were very well done, and one can be trapped in the game's beauty for long periods of time. Heck, even getting lost in that game was fun. However, with the changes as of the last two to three years, a lot of the beauty has been lost. In order to cater to the broader generation of players who demand instant gratification, they have changed out most of the old expansive locations and replaced them with compacted versions - so that players can traverse the world much more quickly. However, by doing so, they've stuffed all the game's content into the newer maps, which makes most of the world appear small and claustrophobic.

The music score for this game is wonderful. Whether you're inside the forests of Ellinia, or exploring the depths of Ludibrium, the background music really amplifies the mystery and beauty the game world is trying to become.

The original MapleStory had a handful of classes, and each of them were unique, but overall balanced. Now, each large 'class update' seems to focus on newer 'Hero' characters, most who severely outclass the older counterparts in terms of damage and flashiness. In fact, there are so many different 'Heroes' nowadays, it saddens me to say that you'll rarely run into the older classes anymore, except in the case of Legacy worlds.

The Cash Shop isn't all too great either. In addition to the standard cosmetic items and EXP boosts that one would commonly find in Free-2-Play MMOs, there are also items which give you in game currency, some which would offer you lowered failure chances when upgrading items. The latter gives players who spend a huge lead over players who don't, and this is made obvious by the overly high prices those items fetch on the marketplace.

Combine that with a marketplace that doesn't let players open one without forking cash (and depending on how much cash you're willing to spend, it also determines whether you'll have to stay logged in to sell items)(players are only able to trade, so they'll have to solicit people in the market entrances) and a bad support team, I truly cannot recommend this game to anyone. MapleStory's golden days are long gone, and what's left is a carcass of what was once a masterpiece."

You know when you see the family at dinner at a restaurant and all of the kids are on their iPads and no one is talking? That's a lot like this game now. It's all about instant satisfaction, and a completely dead community. Yes, I did play Maplestory back in its prime (2005-2008), and yes I am bias, but this game is not for you if you are looking for the original Maplestory. Who knows, maybe if I never played this game before, I would think it is great. It's up to you, there are still some cool things about it. You do your own thing, level up super fast, do some bosses. I love the art style still, but Maplestory now feels super lonely, and nothing you do is rewarding anymore. I haven't died a single time (and yes i have more hours than you see on steam here, I've played 70+ hours a year back not through steam). Nothing is challenging, the game is total instant gratification that dissipates very quickly. There are no specific roles to the class you choose because every class does a ton of damage and has mob control. I digress... You can still have fun on this game, but if you are coming back expecting this game to be the Maplestory you knew back in the day, do not try it (this is an opinion not a fact, do what you want). If you're looking for a lonely grind game that is calming and comforting, this may be a game that you like. Try it and see. It's free to play, so try it and make your own opinion. I'm going to vote positive because I don't think it's a bad game, it's simply not my style like it once was."

The game looks and sounds amazing, but I don't think there's anything positive I can say about the gameplay.

Having played for years, I've seen Nexon devolve into a sad Cookie Clicker design philosophy. The game is now designed for you to sit in one place, on one map, holding the attack button for hours on end maybe with one or two other people, then change to a different map every couple levels and repeat the process. Or, heck, just pick one of the new characters with skills designed to kill everything on the screen indefinitely so you can literally AFK, then brag when you reach the max level with your Kanna by AFKing in a town and asking for +Fame because there's nothing else to do in the game but grind.

All character build variety has been removed so there is now only an illusion of player customization. The new content that gets added amounts to too many convoluted collect-a-thon holiday events and non-MMO subgames that no one asked for. Every now and then there's a story arc with animation and subpar English dubbing, which I don't begrudge them for trying, but big dramatic story arcs weren't what made this game popular. New incomplete features are added before old ones they started years ago are finished--the game has two bestiaries right now, both of which are buggy and incomplete. And that's not even to mention the broken quests, redundant maps, and frequent crashes.

No, from a game design standpoint, this is a mess. I'll admit I keep coming back to the game because the nostalgia is strong, but... as a critic delivering a critical analysis, I can't recommend this game."

I've played this game since I was 10 years old when it came out in america.

The best way to describe maplestory is a deep, deep hole out in the woods.
When you are bored and looking for something to do you fall into this hole.
At first you are scared, you panic and try to get out of the hole.
But slowly, you begin you like it in the hole.
You spend thousands of dollars on making this hole cooler, nicer, and do more dps.
You meet friends, lovers, and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ inside of this hole, it begins to feel like a community.
Then high school girl drama will go down, and you will sell all your gear and quit.
You will struggle to climb out of this hole. And finally....you're out.

You go back to the way your life was before, and you become happy again.

After a couple of months...you feel this craving...this...hunger...
You miss the hole. Sure, the hole has its ups and downs...but you...you were safe in the hole...you were...home...
So you go back, and thus begins the never ending downward spiral of your life.

I would never recommend this game to anyone:
1. This game is dead. Don't see any new players except for those new characters from old players trying to make ""legion""
2. The game mechanic is totally trash: Everything is random except your the chance of you booming your items which is already ridiculously hard to obtain. Want to get item? roll random boxes. Want to get stronger? Roll random stats. What are the chance to get what you want? 0.01%. How much you pay 2$ each roll. Money come from trees I guess.
3. Requires hours of farming/day and still doesn't get you anywhere because everything is so expensive. Funded players do solo bossing leave people with no gears cant progress. You CAN NOT play this game without spending your money (unless you are willing to spend years on it to be 1/6 of 3 months funded players).
4. Game bugs, game crashes
5. Not new players friendly.
6. Poor description of everything. From guide to the quest or event, items. I believe Indian people have even better English skills.
7. 30% success, 70% failure 0.7% destroy the item and you know what. its 100% hit on 0.7%. This feels like a scam
Tons more reason not to play this game."

I remember waking up as a kid, excited and eager to start up my dad's computer, hopping into the world of Maplestory, ready to take on whatever the game was going to throw at me that day. Needless to say, I was hooked. The cartoony yet oddly satisfying visuals, the huge world that was set before me, the deceptively simple class system, all things that I adored about it. For a while, I couldn't get enough of this game. It was my first MMO ever, and, to this day, probably still my favorite. Nothing comes close to the fun I had while killing mushrooms in the starting zone, slaying Balrogs on airships, destroying robots in Ludi, and finally, conquering Zakum. I made many friends, joined a slew of guilds, and mostly, just had fun. That's what videogames were about back when I played Maplestory, and in a sense, it seems like they've kind of lost that recently, although that's a different topic entirely. Maplestory now seems to be much more oversaturated in terms of classes and things to do, actually making it an overwhemingly experience rather than an extremely enjoyable one, one that I had when I played. Needless to say however, I still had a HUGE amount of fun with this game, and is hands-down one of the best experiences, if not THE best, I've had in gaming. I cannot speak to the community now, but when I was playing, it was a bunch of generous and fun loving people, one's that were willing to help others when they needed it. I miss Maplestory, specifically old Maplestory, even more specifically v.066, when things were simpler and I had a bunch of NX to spend on a different hairstyle.

I miss you Maplestory.
Thanks for giving me the game of a lifetime."

This game has the potential to be great. The concept of a 2D MMORPG that's all animated is pretty cool, and there's a lot of charm in this game. I currently have a level 230 Kinesis in Reboot (I use nexon launcher instead of steam) and I've (somewhat) enjoyed the grind up to that point. The community at least in the server I play in is large and thriving. However, this game has major problems that's been in the game for as long as I can remember.

Pros:
- Tons of options in terms of which class/job you want to play with + no big loss of time if you change your main (passive benefits for each char you play)
- Great and flashy animation for a lot of moves, some of the characters you can play can feel extremely fluid
- Customization options are massive (comes with a catch mentioned in cons)
- Large community
- Constant updates and events are happening

Cons:
- Tons and tons and tons of bugs (I cannot stress this enough), includes: buggy bossfights, broken UI, frequent game crashes, possible false ban, very laggy servers (in reboot, idk how it is in other servers)
- Non-reboot servers: very p2w, Reboot servers: overwhelmingly grindy
- Cosmetics is expensive/not worth the price: getting the look you want is based on rng a lot of times or it's time limited
- Nexon
Let me elaborate on the last point in the cons section. This company has been overwhelmingly incompetent when it comes to developing Maplestory. The company has been making extremely controversial balancing decisions for the game, as if they are purposely trying to slow down progression so as to increase the amount of money players have to put in this game. They have no transparency whatsoever. They often change the game without mentioning it in patch notes. They have also done nothing to fix the known problems of the game that has been here for the longest time.

My main point of this review is, if you want to play for nostalgia's sake or just to try it out as a completely new player, go for it. It's a nice experience to try this game (if you get lucky and don't get bugged out), and you can clearly see the charm this game has. However, I would STRONGLY recommend NOT to play this game if you are looking for a game to spend a lot of time in. Nexon has shown little to no interest in listening to the community and they probably never will. You would be better off playing in a different game where the company actually cares about their community and things are hell of a lot more polished than this game is."

I played Maple Story the very first day it was released to North America and since then the game has changed a ton.
The grind in the game was hard but when you got them levels you earned them and it was amazing hearing the stories of guys like Tiger making top Teir and Wizet really loved it's community. Normally in the old maple story you would see admins walking around talking to members as they passed by and it was exciting to see the community with their passion for the game making content like Dray86's Maple Kombat.

Then came Nexon who montized the hell out of the game, took the world that everyone loved and threw it all over the place then they made these hero classes that made the orignal classes completely useless of which had the most insanely high damage you've ever seen. Many of the cool dungeons in maple story became empty which is really sad because they was excellent.

Sadly maple story degressed into this sub par kind of game. I want Wizet back, I want my maple story.

Do I recommend it to you? No, Nexon is a greedy company but you won't really noticed how screwed up the game is unless you was there from the start. You won't notice all the cool stuff taken out because they'll try to blind you with high numbers and stupid classes to ego stroke your ♥♥♥♥."

After 3k hours on Steam and more on the Nexon client I think I can finally say that this is not the game I used to love.
As much as you and I want the old Maplestory back, it won't happen.

You'll probably enjoy the game for the first day or two, until you realise that all the enjoyment is gone and the RMT sucking machine that Nexon is starts crawling up your wallet with their expiring Cash-Shop items and absurd subscriptions such as VAC-Pets. (90€ ??? + 14€ per Month).
Nexon perfected the art of FOMO (Fear of missing out), forcing you to play more, more characters, more hours, more of everything you don't enjoy but MUST, else you miss out on your gear that is relevant for 4 months before something new and shiny comes out. Over and over again.


Please don't do it to yourself and try finding something else to play. Playing nothing is probably a better choice than downloading and starting this game."

I honestly enjoyed this game ever since I started this game as a kid back when it first came out like in 2007 or so on global. I used the same account, linked it to Steam, and returned occasionally to play whenever a big event is being held like Hyper Burning. But now my yearly routine ended after getting a random auto ban for ""suspicious activity for hacking and botting.""

All I do is dailies and weekly bosses on my burning character. And right now they have some star event where you just sit on the chair and AFK for 30 minutes. Which I did, while alt-tabbed playing a different game or browse the web only to get auto banned. I tried to appeal and their senior GM said i violated their Terms of Use. I kept trying to get it sorted out but all the junior GMs refused to help and said their senior GM already checked my ticket and denied me. Absolutely no help in proving my innocence because my character just leveled off of dailies and only used event rewards.

Awful way to quit a game but its just depressing how I can get treated this way after playing the game legit for so long.

Also the nexon account linked to my Steam account will haunt me forever lol."

Maplestory is like an abusive relationship.
Ever since I was a wee young lass, back in 2007, I've been unable to stay away, and I have no clue why. Sure, nostalgia is the main factor, but there are so many other games I played back then that don't keep me coming back as often. No matter how many times I uninstall it, it ends up on my computer again sometime between a few months and a year later. I've never even made it far; most of the time I get a character to level 50 and see some other shiny class I want to try out, and so I have quite a few 1/5th leveled characters that I can never seem to get past level 50. And yet I keep coming back.
10/10 would have no clue why I still play this game again"

I remember playing this game since I was maybe 6 or 7 years old and let me tell y'all, it was AN AMAZING EXPERIENCE. I remember the days of dexless assassins, strength mages and MANO. Remember when old time Maplestory required you to walk all the way to the corresponding town to the job that you wanted to be because you didn't make enough meses fighting snails and orange mushrooms on Maple Island? Remember when you wanted to be a warrior and then walking up to Perion, you got f*cked by a Jr. Boogie?

Yeah this Maplestory No longer exists

You know what this new Maplestory is now? It's now revolved around you basically making every single class in the game and leveling them up to 250 if you want to min max the sh*t out of the game because they provide some pretty dam crucial Link Skills which can be equipped to your other characters for bonus exp, damage, stats, etc.. Okay, maybe you don't have to get every class to 250, but, there are multiple classes where you need to level them up, in order for making other classes even easier to level.

Okay, maybe this doesn't seem to bad itself and maybe you like leveling other classes and experiencing their other skills, THAT'S FINE. It starts to get extremely tedious, when just about everything you want to do requires you to actually ""progress"" in the game. I put quotations around progress because the way that you progress in this game is by raising your main stat for whatever class you are playing.

NOW HERE'S WHERE THE BULK OF THE GAME STARTS. You've spent countless hours leveling multiple characters to 140, but now on your ""Main"" you really need to start pushing levels and getting stronger. Guess what? You need to basically GAMBLE to increase your stats. Look up CUBING, this mechanic in my opinion is relatively ""okay"", but the real struggle is STAR FORCING you godam equipment. Okay gambling? to increase the strength f your equipment? Hey guess what? IT'S GODAM TERRIBLE, I have a level 238 Buccaneer doing dialies/weeklies as well as a hyperburning 241 shadower doing dailies/weeklies. This is including bosses, I had procured around 10 billion mesos, for some thats a lot, for other veteran players, those are rookie numbers. From my perspective, this is 1 and ahalf months worth of work, I've been saving up because I knew there was a STAR FORCE event coming up. I will not waste time explaining any further because other players know the struggle. I SPENT ALL THAT MONEY TRYING TO STAR FORCE MY CRA TOP AND BOTTOM FROM 17 STARS TO 20 STARS, A MEASLY 6 STARS IN GENERAL. Sure okay some players will say that's some small amount I saved, but guess what? I SPENT A MONTH AND A HALF PREPARING. All to get a measly what, 400 extra main stat? And guess what? that's not even the end of trying to rank up your gear, I didn't explain it clearly earlier, but it costs yo MONEY to rank up your gear as well as SOME BS FAKE PERCENTAGE CHANCE to rank up, it might say you have 90% chance to rank up, but guess what, YOU FAIL THAT ♥♥♥♥ TWICE IN A ROW, 90% MY ASS NEXON, SHOW THE REAL STATS.

Well, I may be under the influence at the time of this writing, but I think my point has been made. FIX YOUR GODAM GACHA GATED PROGRESSION NEXON.

As someone who has played MS since the open beta ended way back when up til a few months ago, and even played the Korean, Japanese and SEA servers at different points in time, I think I can give a prety good overview.

A lot of people are blinded by nostalgia when it comes to this game. You may even see people saying that the game was better back when it took 12 hours to lvl up at lvl 73, which is absolutely absurd. The grind to even play your character back then was absolutely ridiculous. The only thing that pre-Big Bang Maplestory had that this version now doesn't is the sense of community and life that was everywhere. People will say that there isn't a sense of community now and that people don't help each other which is untrue. The community just isn't at the low levels, low levels meaning anything below 200. The players are still very friendly and helpful, and will go out of their way to party you if you have quests on the same map, and the Chu~Chu Island PQ at lvl 210 is a bunch of fun. Except for birdsharks. ♥♥♥♥ birdsharks.
You've seen me say lvl 200 and 210 previously, so how many levels are there? 250. There are 250 lvls in this game and at no time does the progression ever not give you rewards. 1-140 give you skill points, 141-200 give you hyper skills, 141-250 give you hyper ability points, and every 6 levels after 200 gives you an extra node slot. The first 200 lvls fly by, there are people that can do them in 8 hours and for some it'll take a few weeks. Most notably though is the insane Exp curve. At lvl 200 the Exp required to level goes from about an hour or two to 4 hours or more, especially if you play on Reboot and train in the Arcane maps before getting the 1,5x Arcane force multiplier from the daily quests. And the grind only gets more and more difficult. Previously I mentioned that at lvl 73 pre-Big Bang you could take 10+ hours to level up. Post Big Bang getting from 203-204 takes about as long without the Arcane force multiplier affecting your damage and letting you grind at better mobs. Because as an unfunded character you're going to be grinding at either Scrapyard or the first area of Vanishing Journey for a good 2 or so weeks if you don't miss any Vanishing Journey daily quests. Later on you can expect 2% exp per hour, which, considering the lvl requirements of later areas like Arcana, is going to take you months.
As for the social aspect of the game now, joining a good, active guild is necessary. If you don't join a good, active guild, on Reboot especially, your progression past 200 will be absolutely glacial. You need a good guild to do end game bosses with and to get decent equipment, which is doubly true for Commerci PQ because most people aren't going to risk having a random in their party looting a class specific weapon or mega rare item that's untradeable on Reboot and worth a bunch on regular servers. So basically, you have to do your social networking and join a community of good players.
Maplestory is very much a long term MMO. You have to get to a threshold level to get into the community, which is really only a matter of time, your progression is measured more in a few months at time than in days or weeks and there is something to do every single day you log in. Most people who say that Pre-Big Bang was better doesn't remember how it used to be and they would quit it if they played it after they played the version that exists now. In summation, ♥♥♥♥ Pre-Big Bang.

Onto the actual game.
The differences between the Korean version and the North American version are staggering, less so with the Japanese and even less with the SEA version. So I'll start off with the easiest.
SEA:
SEA, compared to NA, or Global, used to be different in that they would receive patches ahead of time of NA. To my knowledge this is not true anymore. The only real advantage SEA has is that it has a map called Parkin Lot which makes lvling to 200 even easier. Beyond that, the SEA economy is in absolute shambles and the Cash Shop aspect there is even worse.
JP:
It's been years and years since I've played the JP version or even heard talk of it but from what I recall JP players got 10% more base experience and they have a toad boss that NA doesn't.
KR:
This is the best version of the game. KR Maple does not have Gollux, it does not have Commerci, it does not have ghost exorcist badge, and most importantly it does not have Kannas. So why is this version the best? Because it is the least P2W. The mileage system of KR Maple allows you to buy anything from the Cash Shop, the fact that you can get mileage from bosses, from epic boss spawns, and from frequent events means that you can get pretty much anything you want. You can also buy permanent Cash items either from the Cash Shop or from the fantastic economy. The economy there is wonderful and not crazily inflated. If I remember correctly 1bil mesos there is about $60 USD, which is much much better than any other economy on any other version. The events on this version are frequent and this version gets content the fastest and most frequently as well. The last big difference is that this version has flames on equipment, which is another sort of equipment modifier. I would still not recommend playing this version though unless you can understand Korean and are willing to practice how to type Korean characters. There are a few reasons for this, mainly the English community there is dying and there are only a handful of English speaking players left, you need to know how to type Korean characters to even log into the game and you need them later on to answer anti-botting captchas that randomly pop up. It's fairly simple though to learn, you can learn with a few hours of practice and be fine. The biggest reason I wouldn't recommend this version though is that you have to buy a premade account off of a shady Chinese website for $10.

Maplestory is a pretty fun, mindless game. If you can immerse yourself in the game, you'll have a great time. As is, before you even start the game you have to choose what you'll invest. Do you want to invest time or money into the game? If time, go to Reboot, if not go to any regular server. If you play Korean MS, don't play Reboot.
Now that you've gotten through that, if you're playing on not-KMS (Korean Maplestory) make a Kanna, especially if you're on Reboot, if you're on Reboot playing a Kanna and getting it to at least lvl 150 is mandatory so you can farm gold at a decent rate.
Now that you've gotten your Kanna up to a decent lvl to farm Mesos you can choose what your main class will be. There are a bunch of cool classes like Cadenas and Crossbowmen and what not. Literally any class is viable for end game bosses like Lucid, Damien, Lotus, etc. except for Bishops and Kannas because they DPS way too slowly and bring nothing to boss fights. Ironically Bishops and Kannas are most valuable for grinding lvls and mesos.
Great, so you've brought your main to lvl 200, gotten your Kanna up to acceptable farming rates, and now you're looking for stuff to do inbetween Arcane River dailies, farming for %meso gear and bosses. This is where you go make link and union mules, which gives you a chance to play other classes without feeling like you're wasting time not playing on your main. If you do get to the point where you're making mules for Union get your mules to 141 first for the most convenient Tier of Union and once you have all of them done go back around and get them to 200 for Grand Master Union.

Basically everything you do in this game will eventually get you stronger. Sure you could get even stronger if you spent more money or time, but you'll get there eventually any way. Play it until you get bored, quit for a while then come back and do it again for a bit. You get to scratch your itch of playing a decent, mindless MMO with others and your progression isn't invalidated by new stuff that comes out unless there's a complete overhaul again like Big Bang."

I adored this game as a kid and nostalgia keeps me coming back but there's some glaring problems with it.

First, the good:

-The game mechanics feel fun. Hitting mobs, using skills and running around the mob is exciting and satisfying. The characters are super cute, the NPCs are designed well and every character has their own sort of story (except the original explorers). I actually really enjoyed going through every characters individual starting quests. For a few brief moments, it did feel like a fun little RPG. I also really enjoy the optional aesthetics they created in the cash shop. I think the skins are really charming, the pets are cute and the hair styles are fun.

Now the bad, which is pretty much everything else.

-Old quests are obsolete now. There used to be quests that gave you a cape or unique shoes and everyone wanted to do them. It felt like a little adventure, like an actual RPG. Jane Doe needed help getting medicine and she gives you a cape as gratitude. But now, there are only about 3-5 quests until level 80 that you can do that are worth it. Low level equipment is garbage because you get to level 100 so fast. Everyone just does the theme dungeon because its the best way to get experience, so why do any other quests? I consider bad game design when developers just write code over their old code, and don't maintain that old code. If other quests aren't worth it, no one will do them and it's just a waste of space.

-They come out with a new hero every now and then, and it makes other classes so unrewarding to play, because if one class does so much better, why even play the old ones? In other RPGs, other status such as defense is worth looking into. But due to the fact that you basically have to grind to lvl 100 to do anything fun, the thing that matters is damage output. Don't get me wrong, other classes are viable (not awful, just not good) it's just that when a new class comes out, it does so much more with such little resources, it doesn't feel like you should ever revisit old characters.

-Mesos have been inflated and pets feel mandatory. Old maple used to have a bustling economy . It forced you to purchase a shop if you ever wanted to make real mesos. Then you had to re-invest that money into scrolls for a chance to make your items better. I felt like that was truly pay to win. But now, you can simply increase your equipment's stat through star enhancement, so I can feel powerful without spending nx cash. I appreciate this change but it made way for new problems. I need A LOT of mesos to deck out everything and you can do that by doing certain boss fights but until level 120 you get the money by picking up mesos. That's so annoying to do without a pet, which requires money.

-Another scummy tactic that nexon has used to get money is the idea of MVP. There used to be 2x EXP coupons, which imo was fair. You pay a little extra and you level up faster. You can still level just fine on your own, the 2x felt optional to me. But they took that out now and you get the 2x coupons to give away if you spend enough NX. Because of server abandonment issues, character world transfers are only available through a loot box mechanic system, which is a super scummy way of getting your players to spend more money. To get the items you want, you have to keep wasting more money.

-They re-worked how hair coupons work to make more money. Old maple had all hair types at your disposal. You had to check what city the hair was available in and then go to the city, purchase it, and you're good to go. Now, there are only two hair coupons. One is random royal hair coupon and the other one is a choice coupon. Theres so many hair styles but they all go on rotation, so the one you want might not be available until next month. This means if you create a character, and want to change the hair style you HAVE TO choose and buy whatever is in stock at the moment. This means if you dont like the hair your character has, you have to change it to whats available then spend money to buy hair again when the one style you like comes out.

-There are bugs everywhere. I don't know if it's bad coding but they seem to only rewrite code on top of existing code. For example, their text UI stays open when another text UI opens. The search bar for their map stops working every once in a while. If I can't find anything, the world map crashes. Upon even opening maplestory, it fails about 30% of the time and I have to re-launch it. When I try to click on a spot in a map, a pop up says 'you dont have a teleport rock' then navigation opens. It feels like the developers were lazy and just didnt code that out. Just write 'if (rock not in inventory) then (dont show pop up)'. But perhaps theres too much spaghetti code and they can't write over it. It happens with projects that have too many developers or projects that are too old.

-The UI is TERRIBLE. My god. It's 2020 as I write this review and the UI is so ♥♥♥♥♥♥ awful. As soon as you finish your base quest and you're free to do what you want, there's so much garbage stuffed in your face. But this is a common flaw I see in a lot of MMOs. The developers think players want every button for guild, quests, mining, etc available to them, without considering how much it clutters a screen. How are new players supposed to come to this game without being overwhelmed? To get into it, you pretty much have to have a friend to guide you through it.

-The worst thing they did, imo, was completely nerf low level party quests. They replaced everything with theme dungeons, which give good exp but the reason why maple was so popular before was because of the social aspect. I had to do ludi PQ, or kerning PQ and it was super fun. I met people and made friends, which made me want to continue to play. PQs gave players reason to interact. The social aspect of MMOs are what make MMOs enjoyable and nexon kind of just ruined that.

Overall: greedy company ruined this game. Don't play unless for the nostalgia.

Updated Edit: Worth playing casually, but that's it. Don't spend money on this game. Log in and have some fun, but this game isn't worth giving to the company. Some of the most disgusting tactics I've seen with horrible customer service. Events are buggy, new players have a hard time progressing, everything is RNG. Use it as an afk machine for when youre watching something or doing something on the side.

Still buggy with little QOL improvements. Why does my item menu go transparent when im being hit by a mob? Take that garbage out."

This game has gambling mechanics, and these gambling mechanics are necessary for progress. If you play on a ""regular server"", you can pay real money to gamble for progress. If you play the ""Reboot server"", you earn in-game currency through gameplay, and you gamble with that instead.
If you're like me, if you understand statistics, if you're not vulnerable to gambling addiction, if you play Reboot, you can play this game with no problems.
If you are vulnerable to gambling addiction, if you don't rigorously keep track of your spending, this game can hurt you for real, and hard. There is some seriously negativity in this game's player base, because some people have been seriously hurt financially by this game. Some people continue to be hurt by this game.

That's why I'll never recommend this game to anyone. If you're not vulnerable to gambling addiction, this game has a lot of content and is a lot of fun, and it's even fun free2play.

It's a good game overall, but before you Invest your Time and Money to this Maple Journey, I would warn you First.

This game is all about RNG, enhancement of your Gear requires that, drop of equip requires that, and upgrading Gear potential requires that. Worst of all, you can get banned in a Totally Random time at totally random moment. PURE RNG.

and once you get banned even if you didn't hack or anything, you lost all your rights.

Investigation team doesn't care if you hacked or not, they only care if anything triggered their ♥♥♥♥♥♥ anti-hack system.
while real hackers hacking all they want.

And the moment you get falsely banned. You WON""T be able to recover anything, not even the NX you charged an hour ago before you get banned.

NO REFUND TO HACKERS, they said. even if you didn't hack.

It's a great game, great art and music, but it's been ran by notorious Nexon .

Don't invest your time and money on this , Read their ToS. They can literally Suspend,Delete,Ban your account with no reason, it's written there !"

So yeah, I genuinely cannot recommend this game as of right now. Maybe in the future I will change my review on Maplestory again. I have many more hours on the Nexon client.

Nexon KR has decided that the global release should be more in line with the Korean client (nothing wrong necessarily). But Nexon NA (works as publisher for the global version) have been straight up lying to the players about why choices have been made. Just look up ""2x drop coupons GMS"" on YouTube and listen to explanations by CopperSan or Scardor. In short, every kind of strategy or item that could be beneficial for player progression is either being removed or nerfed into oblivion. Everything that made the global release its own game, is being removed slowly for the past ~2 years. Which really does suck. Korean, NA and EU are very different clients that need to be catered differently. It's too bad because there is no other game like MapleStory. I really like the chibi characters and cutesie look of the game. Yeah, the game is grindy, always has been. But big numbers make my lizard brain tingle in a good way.

Although these last points really suck, I would still play the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game if it weren't for Nexon NA incompetent communication. Every single point of interest that needs addressing, either happens too late or doesn't happen at all. But, let's say communication about a certain delicate topic happens, Nexon NA gets caught lying about reasoning or ""data"". This has happened a lot of times in the last ~4 years. If you don't believe me, go to r/MapleStory and sort by ""All Time Top"". You will find threads stacked on top of each other about boycotts and their reasoning. Literally everytime the number 1 argument is the barren communication between Nexon NA and the community. This year, for the first time, Maplestory Global had a roadmap released. The roadmap was a joke and Nexon didn't comply with their own planning, again no communication about it.

I really hope Nexon & Nexon NA get their ♥♥♥♥ together and start looking at ways to engage more with the community behind the global release. These people are literally the most engaged group of people I have seen in a long time. So, after this long rant, just don't play it. It's not worth it, because you literally never know what might happen next. It could be you just loose 6 months of progression because the stupid starforce system or because Nexon decided to nerf your class to the ground without warning. I didn't talk about the enhancing system at all in this review, but if you think BDO or POE is awful, just wait until you learn you could loose 2~3 months of progression by booming an item. So, no stale progression, like LA, actually loosing progression.

I have no idea if Steam will say at all if I've played Maplestory but I promise you all I have put a lot of time into this game and absolutely loved every minute. Unfortunately Maplestory just became completely uninteresting since I've tried to relive it. And it makes me really sad. Maplestory originally had the classes we all see in every MMO (no matter how hard other MMO's try to make it different) and of course also like every MMO it started off simple. One big difference of course was the fact that it was a 2D sidescrolling MMOPRG and it's done so beautifully. You can make different faces at people depending on how you feel which was really fun before the cliche ""lol"" and ""lmao"" texts we all now universally know. Getting weapons was also a little more unique since most MMO's just milk weapons. Now a lot of MMORPG's have bows with unlimited arrows and guns with unlimited bullets. Maplestory made you buy arrows and throwing stars/shuriken if you wanted to be a ranged class. And Mesos (Maplestory currency) was hard to come by at low levels making it even more challenging since you had to actually ask for money from time to time.

When I originally loved this amazing piece of gaming art you had to use a taxi to get to different cities (which you still do at least) and use flying boats to get to different continents. This was a huge deal because it allowed you to just settle down for a short time and actually talk to people; and listen to music along the way. Now this is not the case. There were no overpowered and annoyingly voice acted 'Hero' classes that literally kill everything in their paths with ease. You really had to work to get more powerful back then and you also needed to manually know what your stats needed to be for your class. Maplestory added more powerful classes over time but they were never 'Hero' status. Yes they got more powerful due to their unique skills compared to the default classes; however you still needed to start off as a default class and work your way into the more unique class you selected and leveling was still just as hard for you as the rest.

The music is still the same Maplestory anime music I know and love. I just wish it could be heard with the game I knew and loved. For all you new players out there reading this review it'll mean close to nothing probably. To shorten what I just said: Maplestory used to be a surprisingly vast game filled with lots of social opportunity and hours upon hours of questing and leveling. It's a shell of its former self now. This does not mean I say it's a bad game. It's still good and worth the try. But unfortunately you have missed the golden age that was Maplestory. It's all milked down and I can't recommend it in its state now. What used to take a couple weeks to a month takes less than a day now. Bosses that originally required a full team can easily be defeated solo and the monsters that were originally intimidating and powerful are powerless. The challenge is gone. I will miss you Maplestory."

Here is an honest review of this game

Pros:
-Very well-made and rare 2D style, very refreshing
-Beautiful Art in weapons, monsters, maps and landscapes
-Amazing original sound tracks that masterfully complements the Art
-Interesting story and worldbuilding
-Multiple options to spend your time in game, that although grindy can be a lot of fun
-Distinct and balanced classes for the player to choose
-Active developers and moderators with great anniversary and seasonal events
-Fair and mostly cosmetic real money transactions that you don’t need to advance to a decent level

Cons:
All of the Pros points are no longer true in recent times, and are only alive in the memory of the og players that you can hear whisper “Look How They Massacred My Boy…”

This Game WAS a MSTERPICE in all its extent but Nexon has found a way to corrupt and butcher one of the best mmorpg games ever made and completely alienate and divide their player base

Let me state the current state of the Pros points
-Very well-made and rare 2D style – Only still true because they can’t mess this one up, but is becoming irrelevant as time passes
-Beautiful Art in weapons, monsters, maps and landscapes – becoming more and more pixel noise on the screen with no much thought put into it, the difference with the old and original content is very palpable, and the similarities makes it look as if the original developers/artists could sue the new ones for copyright
-Amazing original sound tracks that masterfully complement the Art – The new music is not bad but nowhere near the level of the iconic masterpieces that the original songs on the old maps represent and felt when played, the sheer amount of personality added via music was amazing
-Interesting story and worldbuilding – long gone, the story has been changed, made irrelevant and poorly expanded to the point where you cant make sense of all the mess, far from the simple yet interesting story that would make you want to complete the main quest line, reduced to a nuisance you have to complete to advance your class
-Multiple options to spend your time in game – The game is now complete grind, this was also somewhat true before, but now it has been reduced to very few maps where you sit and spam a single wide area attack for hours in the same spot with the few classes that allow you to, other classes that cannot do this are simply unviable.
There are no options, no variation, no nothing, but the same map with the same monster and same attack, every 10 levels until you move to the next.
-Distinct and balanced classes for the player to choose - new classes completely overpowered the original ones, instead of creating new concepts, mechanics, weapons and story they simply took the style and roles the og classes fulfilled and raised the power level in every aspect, while thinking the player wouldn’t notice the lazy copy paste under a different label, they did noticied.
Again, there are no options, no variation, no nothing, all the different ways to build you character and play have been removed from the game, even though we have many times the number of classes the game had years ago it feels like you have less options because only a few classes are viable now, with the building path being set in stone, there is only optimal build and complete trash, there is no in between.
-Active developers and moderators with great anniversary and seasonal events – gone, events are mostly repetition of what has been done before and the lack of community is determining to the success of the event, reduced to more solo grind
-Fair and mostly cosmetic real money transactions that you don’t need to advance to a decent level.
Finally, the worst part of all, pay-to-win is the law that governs this game now, like so many other famous games pay-to-win butchered the original cash system and made it impossible to play end game content without milking the player in some way, constantly forcing players to expend a large amount of money or lag behind the rest

The worst part is that every negative aspect of pay to win, has been multiplied by the HUGHE amount of RNG that is involved in the process, every item you’re forced to buy is linked to an awful RNG mechanic know as ‘success rate’ everything that enhances your gear has a success rate awfully low or is plane lottery with the thing you want having less than 1% chance to happen, causing players to buy hundreds of items just to get the one thing they wanted in the first place

In Resume this game was a masterpiece a decade ago, today the only people playing do it just for nostalgia, they go the old areas and listen to the good old music and once-great places now wastelands, or have spent so much they feel like they can’t quit now, or are completley new and play for a while until they realise what is underneed this beautiful shell of a game that now is best used as an example to new games and companies on how not to run and maintain a game/brand."

Ok, so I have played a decently amount of time for this game... i mean, 4000 hours...

Pros:
-Waifu bosses
-(reboot server is the only aspect that isnt p2w)

Cons:
-need pay-to-win gears to get to and beat waifu bosses

-boring events and / or recycled events

-dev doesnt listen to the community (they recently did a survey on r/maplestory, however, every person's concern were either skimmed over or just blatantly ignored, instead the devs addressed the issue by making up their own opinions. Basically a survey of wasting players 5mins)

-community manager sucks at communicating (r/maplestory hates the community manager because he has blatantly banned a player on the official forums reason being the player criticized the CM on reddit...like really dude?)

-no transparency between devs and the community (theres no communication channel between the CM and the community unlike every other game this age, theres no weekly stream, theres no dev logs, theres no updates on if any of the glitches/issues are being worked on, NOTHING)

-toxic community

-censor words in the game are just ridiculous, ""my first time"" is censored...

-grind fest (surely it's been made easier to level from 1-200, however, most end game content is located at lv 220, to put in perspective, lv 219-220 is leveling 1-200 4 times)

-useless quests, an insane amount of useless quests (what's even worse is the rewards doesn't even scale to level, and the rewards are straight up fodder made for NPC or tossing it away, consequently you can progress in the game without doing a single quest, whats even better i you'll lag LESS if you dont do them)

-game is filled with hackers, botters, and cash farmers (aka the economy in the game is absolutely horrible, and it isnt that easy to get money either)

-game masters doesnt do jack with hackers (to top it off, game masters themselves dont know how to play the game, i.e. during GM events, they dont even know the censorship is outta whack in the game (you can see the words not censored on your side, but on other people's screen it's censored), doesnt know how to cancel buffs via right click)

-very easy to hack in and will result with no consequences whatsoever

overall, a mediocre, less-than-average game to waste time in but not good enough to stick around if youre coming back or wanting to try this game out

edit: for a game that's been out for more than 10 years, it's very glitchy, it's very unstable, it crashes way too much, and the devs have said they are ""looking into it"" for the past 5 years and nothings changed"

I used to play this game in early high school, damn near almost 20 years ago. I wanted to come back and relive some memories. I expected a lot to have changed throughout the game, but I didn't expect the first 2 hours of the ""explorer"" story, the one you want to play for the most classic experience, to be an endless barrage of talking, poor voice acting, a generic ""evil mage"" story and being teleported to random places by questgivers. I'm supposed to be an ""explorer"". Why are questgivers teleporting me to precisely where I need to be for a quest? What's the point of exploring? And then when I get there, it's just more unskippable scenes and more talking.

I just want to play the game, bro. Not listen to some grown adult get a job at Nexon play out their 20 year old Maple Story self-insert fan fiction. I have never been so bored in my life. I thought that whole section was a tutorial, then I reached my SECOND (??????) Job Advancement? I don't even remember leveling up. I would sit there, talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and, and then suddenly, with no real notification, I'm level 30 and have like 120 unspent skill points?

I thought skill advancement was supposed to be reward for playing the game, not just something that you passively accumulate in between conversations with cringy chibi anime characters.

If you played this game a very long time ago, and looking for that nostalgia kick, don't even bother. Go on Youtube and watch old videos of what Maple Story used to be."

I really can't recommend it right now, but its the best game in the world.
I talk about 2004-2006 MapleStory, the game that was an adventure to go and meet new people
People were nice and funny, At certain points, it was a must to play with people to advance.
It's really the summary of summaries about maple, but I think you got me.

Nowadays maple is bitter, cold ,
you basically play a singleplayer game that sits on an online service.
Rarely you'll find someone that will be interested in communication.

World of warcraft classic server was announced a month ago.
The community knew the old wow was what they wanted to play and they fought for it.
I think it's our time to fight for our lovely game too.

Go play old server instead, you'll get the feeling I got in about 10 minutes into the game."

While fun overall leveling and unique for it's 2D style, the game as a lot of issues, and it's why I would not recommend it. You're free (well kind of) to try it and form your own opinion but this is just me.


Biggest cons in my opinion:

You are forced to get carried for the good loot that you would need to do the bosses with, which is silly. The alternative is to play the OP classes that doesn't require much insane gearing.

Potential on items is so rare it's stupid, and since you need to potential all your gear but only have a small chance to actually succeed the scrolls.

You need to buy pets with real money to loot items for you, otherwise it's just tedious to get the item drops, and they are not permanent duration.

A lot of quests don't have any good guidance as to what to do next or where to go, end up alt tabbing to see what needs to be done, and a lot of times guides aren't up to date so it's extra difficult.

Prequests are sometimes long, annoying and or not rewarding to unlock bosses. And guess what, you need to redo all of them if you want to play those on another character.

Server issues and maintenance downtime are often ludicrous, For example today is a big event arrival and only 1-3 very unstable servers are usable and sometimes the game won't even launch.

The resolution is quite low, so when you're on a higher native resolution and tabbing out it's really annoying.

Most of the clicking with the mouse is then cluncky and if you're slightly inaccurate the action won't perform. Such as dialogue boxes and menus and so on.

You need to play many characters at high levels before getting more damage for endgame that is somewhat required for certain classes.

I have probably 2000+ hours before this game even hit Steam. Everyone is absolutely correct in saying this game is a husk of its former self. Big Bang changed it forever, however... I just can't stop coming back. On and off occassionally over the years. Maybe it's nostalgia, maybe it's like a bad relationship where you tend to block out the bad and only see the good. The company isn't much better either. I started playing in 2006, and still to this day can't stop finding my mind wavering back to it every so often. Its like that ex you just can't stop texting, but she herself isn't really wanting to let you leave either.

MapleStory,Not Recommended,280.4,"Posted: December 12, 2014
Review as follows: Simple version up top, detailed on ""read more"". Note: I have played this game for well over 2,000+ hours over the years, and long before it was released on steam; how I ever racked up that many hours I will never know, but the game is not worth even 1 hour of your playtime.

The good:
A classic 2D action platformer
Many character classes
Many areas to explore
The Bad
Character classes are horribly balanced
Classes do not particularly stand out from each other (their niche's all blur together now)
There is a huge problem with botters and hackers (people using cheats)

On to the detailed and truely abominable things that make this game horrendous, almost beyond words.


The simple act of looting is to push the ""loot"" button which is both ""Z"" and the numpad 0. As you progress through the game the method for fighting ""mobs"" is at the bucket loads, you will be killing 4~12 monsters within every 5 seconds. Each monster drops 2~4 items which are money, a misc monster drop, a potion, and a ""ticket fragment"" of sorts to do a special instance run that is always dead (no one does them.). So for every item you want to pickup, you must push ""Z"" and you will find that you will quickly be pushing that key hundreds if not THOUSANDS of times every few minutes. And if you dont loot those items you make essentially no money. The entire economy is seriously inflated to begin with too. If you want looting to be convenient be prepared to shell out about $30~$40 every 90 days for a pet and its ""gear"" to make it run around to loot things for you.

You are forced to struggle with inventory space. At first you may think that you have plenty of space, but you quickly find out that the ""Use"" items and ""misc"" tabs will quickly be overlowing from NECESSARY items (the several hundred or THOUSAND potions you will be carrying, and have to replace every few hours or so). while the ETC slot will be filled with quest items, materials for crafting, and of course the hoards of monster drops you will be picking up (which usually only stack up to 200).

Items you buy with $$ are NOT account-wide. They use a nonsense ""cash inventory"" system which is only shared with other characters of the same class (except in some rare caes like the ""adventurer"" series of classes or the ""cygnus knights."" However after the addition of the resistance they have their own shared cash inventory as well. You may think that is good enough but it IS NOT! because there are 2x of all that combined in classes that have a cash inventory shared only with other characters of the same class (which is POINTLESS because then you would be leveling up the exact same thing all over again; as each class only has 1 build, a special exception is made few 2 or 3 classes which can be either 1 element or another). Please note I am not talking about how a magician splits off into ice/lightning or fire/poison, I am referring to how a single class with a single skillset can have skills you wont want to invest in because they have no real part in the only effective way to create your character; which can be ever so important as there are skills in future advancements that require some certain skills to be Maxed.).

They purposefully make things that should be everyday and easy access functions, exceedingly hard. For example, if you want to sell ANYTHING to ANY players, you want to go to the ""free market"" with about 50 other people, all spamming trying to sell things. If you want to sell ANYTHING as easily as it should be, you have to spend about ~$5 to buy a shop that your character has to man (lasts 90 days) just to sell things, which is horrendous in itself because you cant play the game, and it has a tendency to , and so hard you will have to . So if you want to sell things as effectively as it should be, you have to spend $10 USD+ just to setup a store that will sell things for you (you set prices), and those can last 1 day to 7 days (getting more expensive for longer, up to $30 USD.)


They come out with new character classes OFTEN! I swear, whenever you start getting your character to a high enough level to be happy with it, they release something that will outclass you in EVERY WAY! and you will essentially be forced to play that newest class since the monsters only get stronger to keep competing with the newest classes. And dont expect your old class to get revamped any time soon! it took them well over 3 years just to update the adventurers ONCE. and over a year for most anything else. In some cases the skillsets even change so completely you wont even recognize what to put your skill points into! but it gets because if you make a mistake you will have to spend the $5+ USD to reset your points and hope you get it right the next time. It used to be that you had to spend about that much to reset a SINGLE POINT! and most skills require 20 or 30, im sure you can see how atrocious that is (the complete reset is only a new addition too, if you wanted reset you had to wait until they revamp your class again, because customer service WILL NOT HELP YOU!

Customer service from Nexon is essentially non-existant, in fact, 99% of any and all messages you will get from them are automated. And no matter how large or small your problem is, nothing will be done. Your account getting hacked, or a broken quest (some havent been fixed for 2+ years), maybe even missing items/progress from a rollback, you will not get any help.

There is no acceptable passive regen's (% or fixed numbers) for being in or out of combat, the only class that had one (the Jett) was removed with their revamp. So of course you must rely on potions ENTIRELY for you healing (unless you are a healer of sorts). The only passive regen you do have is 10hp for standing still for 10 seconds, and at higher levels (something you quickly reach) you have 7,000+ HP easy. while mana regen's at 3, which your mana is easily over 2,000 regardless of class (mages can go up to 30,000).

There are countless more horrible things I can tell you about, but i feel I have made my point, and I beleive this is enough reasons why this game is among the things you should never play. Comments and likes are greatly appreciated! lets get the word out on why this is an awful game!"
MapleStory,Not Recommended,"2,454.2","Posted: July 4, 2022
UPDATING THIS REVIEW ONE MORE TIME: Nexon has officially removed the Jett class from the game because it introduces bugs they don't want to dedicate time towards fixing. Jett is a Global Maplestory exclusive class. There are a few other non-Korean Maplestory classes like Beast Tamer, Hayato, and Kanna which could be removed on a whim at this point. They allowed anyone with a Jett to transfer to a different job in the Explorer branch, but the way the transfer was done was poor and not well thought out. I was personally affected as I had a level 250 Jett I had sunk around 1000 hours into (kind of low for some of the more hardcore players). Honestly after this removal my desire to play the game is basically zero, there's no reason to put time into these unique classes when they could be removed at any time for any reason. The hyper burning and tera burning events aren't enough for me to come back. I'd still recommend playing literally any other game, even Lost Ark.

The ignition update has now launched (11/16/22) and I wanted to add a small tidbit to this review. Nexon has officially removed an item from the game that boosts spawn rates for two hours. You used to be able to buy 15 of these per month by using currency from killing bosses. Without these the game is still perfectly playable but progression will be much slower in comparison. Still cannot recommend this game, and certainly not in light of spawn booster removal.

To be frank, I love this game but can't recommend it to anyone.
It's not even that the game has many problems, to Nexon's credit many client bugs and server issues that used to plague this game are generally fixed and I might crash once a month now. Whereas in the past I would crash once or twice a day while doing dailies.

It's not even that progression is heavily time gated through dailies, or that the game requires an absurd amount of hours and has a near necessity to create dozens of alts to make any real progress on your main.

It's not even that I think the EXP curve is bad post 250, or that the balancing is bad, or that the jump between killing higher level bosses is bad.

It's not even that for the mind numbing weeks of grinding that turn in to months, and then to years you're not even guaranteed to make progress. Blowing up your equipment is the norm here. RNG will be both cruel and benevolent.

I think the main reason I can't recommend this game to anyone is that there are so many better things to do with your time. I'm invested in the game, I'll be playing it until it shuts down. I don't mind that it's going to suck thousands of hours more of my life away before I stop playing.

But if you're dead set on playing this game and you want something mindless with a steady sense of getting something done, this is a good fit. There are so many unique classes in this game it's hard to imagine someone not finding something they'll fall in love with. You've heard it again and again from reviewers but the graphics in this game feel timeless. The music is beautiful, and if you've played in the past the nostalgia is going to hit hard. It's endearing. As of writing this review (7/4/22) the Destiny update has launched and right now might be the best time ever to play this game.

Assuming you're going to play the game in the ""traditional sense"", the gameplay loop will be grinding for an obscene amount of hours to get strong enough to take down a new boss. You'll kill the boss, get the loot if it has any, and start gearing up to kill the next boss. Sounds fast right? Not really. Bosses are weekly and their drops are either RNG or time gated. With some bosses you could go dry for over a year on a drop you might want.

Know what you're signing up for here. At the bare minimum you'll need to train 12 other characters that you may not enjoy playing to gain skills to ""transfer"" to your main. These are fairly significant and you'll need them if you're going to be serious about playing. If you really want to min/max you'll need to play a total of 40 characters, not consistently, but at least each one to a specific level. I enjoyed it, many don't.

Assuming you don't want to spend money, the Reboot server is generally the way to go. This server disables trade between players and has been revamped to allow players to play the entire game without spending money if they really want. Otherwise, playing on any other server be prepared for a long F2P road or to fork over money in the magnitudes of thousands to reach the endgame. Reboot is a time investment. Regular servers are generally a money investment. Both are possible F2P.

If you're on the fence and like what you see in videos and pictures, give it a shot. The real gameplay loop starts at level 200. Look up guides for things you're confused on, the game has a lot of different systems and menus you need to navigate to enjoy it.

Otherwise, don't bother. Find another game."

Maplestory was a great game until the big bang, the massive update which changed allot about the game. It use to take a long time to level, and maps were filled with players. Exploring was fun, diverse and dangerous. Cash shop didn't even exist, okay it did but it was not selling crazy buffs, items or even pets. Back then it was completely optional. This created a fair and fun game. Party quests were awesome and made you play and work together with other players. Each class had a specific task to fufill. I remember how the thief used the dark sight skill to accomplish a goal which only he could do because of the mobs doing crazy damage. This was rad!

Today it's all about spending money. You level 10 times faster and there's no need for exploring. There is seriously a way to fast travel without even having to been there first. Quests are accepted and completed remotely. You rarely meet other players. The party quests still exist (all in one place now, no need to actually go to that specific town or place) but good luck finding a team. It's all empty. You level alone, you play alone, you do your theme dungeons, get to 4th (or 5th? idek) job and just start grinding bosses until you hit level cap and spend money in cash shop so you get the best items with the best stats..

TL;DR: This game is as good as dead, and is mostly p2w. Not recommended. RIP."

Maplestory is a game I have played for 15+ years. The game is much different now than it was on release, as is normal for any game that has been going on as long as Maplestory has. My main issue with Maplestory is the predatory nature of the microtransactions.

Recently Nexon, the publishers of Maplestory, released their rates for their cubes. For those who are unaware, cubes are the way you power up items. They are expensive and difficult to obtain without spending lots of money. Cubes reset the potential stats on items. They have a chance to upgrade the stats to a higher tier, going from Rare - Epic - Unique - Legendary. These stats are where the bulk of your damage comes from.

The rates that were released showed that there was less than a 2% chance of getting an upgrade from Epic to Unique and the rates for Unique to Legendary was less than 0.5%. You can understand how frustrating this can be for someone who has sent thousands of hours in the game (I played years before the steam release). Nexon has a history of providing terrible transparency and customer support to their players.

As fun as this game can be, I do not recommend it. If you are looking for something to kill some time, you will be better off playing almost any other game. Don't let the cute pixel art draw you in."

I first played MapleStory in December 2004. Back in those days, each town was teeming with life! It didn't really matter what you were doing - if you were buying potions, grinding monsters, completing quests, traveling around, or even just sitting still, odds were that at least a few people would cross paths with you. MapleStory did an excellent job at encouraging players to work together with fun and rewarding party quests. My favorite party quests, the monster carnival, pitted two teams of players against each other in a pseudo-PvP mode where you raced against the other party to kill as many monsters as you could before time ran out, and there were plenty of buffs you could get for your own team and debuffs you could cast on your opponent. Some of the greatest memories I have come from those duels. Each class was quite distinct from each other and while there were a few that were less balanced than others in terms of damage output and maneuverability, all were fun to play in their own right. Each server had a vibrant economy, with literally hundreds of players in the ""free-market"" at all hours of the day trying to buy and sell. The cash shop offered stores that you could leave open to sell items for you while you were offline. New content updates added new regions, monsters, and party quests that were always a joy to explore. Unfortunately, around 2010 a controversial update known as ""Big Bang"" was released, which re-organized the world map cutting out a lot of fan-favorite areas (R.I.P. Henesys Hunting Ground) and introduced a new system called Miracle Cubes. Up until this point, the only way to upgrade your gear was by using scrolls, a rare item dropped extremely rarely that would give you the chance to upgrade your gear. A 10% chance scroll would offer a large boost, whereas a 100% scroll would offer a small boost of maybe only a single stat point or two. With miracle cubes, which you have to spend real money on, you are able to re-roll up to three additional slots on your weapons stats. There's not much inherently wrong with this system, but the bonuses offered by these cubes cannot compare to what you could achieve before. Each slot can potentially give a bonus of +12% in a stat. Players that spent money on cubes were in another league than everyone else. This pretty much ruined the balance of the game and split the community down the middle. Not only that, but Nexon continued to disincentivize players from partying up. They implemented an EXP decrease if you were in a party with someone else and reduced the experience gain from party quests. New updates brought free, instant teleportation between continents (more or less) which pretty much meant that you wouldn't meet as many people as you were traveling from town to town. Solo-grinding became the fastest most efficient way to level up, so areas of the game that used to be brimming with life are now literal ghost-towns. MapleStory was once an excellent MMORPG, but now it is just a husk of it's former self. If you're able to find friends to play this game with, it might still be worth playing, but ask anyone, the glory days of this game are far, far, behind us."

(This review is based on the timeframe I spend playing the game from 2006 to early last year)

Maplestory is one of those games that you remember fondly as you watch it burn to the ground. All the old players from the past no longer reflect on the game as being one of the greatest memories of the era, as so many changes happened to the game that caused it to be what it is now.

To start, back in 06, I had started the game based on a friend's recommendation and ended up hitting forth job in 09. Back then, the grinding through levels was real and it took a normal player a few years to reach 3rd-4th job, which felt meaningful and players had pride for the work that they had put so much effort into the game.

Fast forward, and Big Bang, the expansion that was supposed to upgrade the game ended up shifting up a lot of the areas that players had met ingame. What was thought to be an expansion of the main game ended up with a boatload of different jobs and skill changes that overwhelmed the base game, causing upgrades to damage that ended up weakening the bosses that would take hours to kill into very-short session and the game really started to go downhill from there.

What took years to achive forth job ended up changing to getting to third or forth job in the matter of weeks. Playing the game casually, I ended up making it past level 200 without putting any effort as I would have in the past. Most bosses I fight now, save for the super broken chaos bosses, takes under a few minutes to kills. The impact of having a 200+ character is merely meaningless as the game is designed to have you make as many characters as possible instead of putting effort into a solo character that would prove to be the most meaningful to the player.

It may be that simply times are different now, and the expectations for mmo games have changed. However, maplestory changed itself too much from its original state and I simply cannot recommend this game anymore."

Boycott Nexon until they fix the servers and so many underlying issues on GMS. It's a mess, and they don't care about the player base; only their underlying profits.

Nexon America has a habit of ""promising to communicate better"" and then band-aid fixing issues, completely ignoring the community on some issues, server stability being one of many. Usually it's a ""We'll promise to do better, using Pink Bean Bulletin"", when in reality never using it. Some classes have been known to have been bugged to the point you get an automatic 30 day ban (Beast Tamer comes to mind).

To me, one thing that has become more noticeable in recent times than ever, is blatant favoritism towards the Reboot server, a server that has no trading and enhancement items available for meso, as well as some other perks. It's more of a ""solo progression server"" per-se, but usually any compensation or acknowledgement of issues only goes there, when there even is an acknowledgement of issue.

I've been playing MapleStory on and off since 2010, and the amount of ""it'll get better"" I've seen is absolutely horrendous; the communication is so bad to the point that it feels like DICE with Battlefield 2042, a whole different mess. There's realistically no point to play this game in North America/Europe at this point (especially if you're Dutch, given normal servers are essentially Reboot without any perks now). If you seriously want to play this game, other regions manage better, even the considered ""bad"" regions (thinking potentially of Asiasoft and MapleSEA).

All in all, this game is a shell of its former self, caused by a company that's got its head so far up it's own rear that they can't even do proper communication, to the point the CMs are being attacked, meanwhile there isn't much they can do.

Boycott Nexon, boycott MapleStory, any NX sales, or anything. This game needs true time and effort to fix the underlying crashing and stability issues, as well as the absurd amount of bugs that have plagued the game for years now, to the point it's barely playable, and you have to weigh whether the game will crash or not with too much on screen.

x3TheAran59, better known as Steve, made a YouTube video covering some of the things, and there's even a boycott Discord server due to how bad the game has gotten (you can find that easily on Reddit).

To say I'm disappointed in this game is an understatement; I'm absolutely disgusted with how they treat their players as cash cows and not players, and instead can't even find the issues with their servers (to the point they claimed upgrading them made them worse), and so much more.

All in all, MapleStory is a shell of its former self; if you can somehow get past the huge, HUGE issues, it's grindy to the point it's not even enjoyable at late game. The game is in a category of its own, given it's one of the only 2D MMORPGs on the market, but the huge disconnect has caused a huge rift and glaring problem for players, potentially Nexon.

Don't play this game, for god's sake. Play a better game."

In my opinion, this game used to be really good. It's still good, but not as good as it was.

Maplestory has lost something that many older players found extremely valuable, community. While community still exists in the form of guilds, free market, and henehoes, the lack of rewarding party quests and party-training zones encourage most players to walk the path of a solo player; simply put, the game rewards you much more for playing by yourself.

The game is still enjoyable. It allows you to spend your time to work towards achieving a certain goal, whether it be a higher level or new items. If you love grinding, you'll really enjoy this game."

This game should be 18+. Aggressive loot box and monetization of game mechanics to trick people into wanting to spend money in a game with a kid friendly art style and child friendly censorship, do not at a glance, line up with the games target demographic.

Good core gameplay. If you know exactly what you are doing the monetization in the game is quite reasonable excluding loot box systems, you can earn currency to buy monetized things by spending time in game which is always a nice mechanic to see in MMO.

Dailies system has been pushed nearly as far as it can go. Daily mission used to bring people back everyday can take 1-3 hours depending on current events and how much you care about your progression.

Lots of replayability, in fact the game wants you to make 40 characters (a Legion) which will take you between 5-80 hours each depending on your experience and resources on hand. (There area few 2 hour runs but this will not be 99% of players)

Fair amount of diversity in playstyle in the characters so it helps not make it too monotonous and if you abandon a character because you don't like it don't worry you helped make all your other characters stronger in the future your work is not wasted you helped your Legion.

Every month I've been playing this game there has been some scandal with the devs mistreating the community. Looking at community pages this appears to be a trend and they show very little signs of trying to improve. People are often gaslighted for voicing their opinions which may explain the lack of positive response from the developer.

No other game like it in the market."

Oh man has this game died so much.

When I first began playing which was in 2009, the Maplestory community was the best gaming community I had EVER experienced. The social aspect of the game was absolutely amazing. Back then, Factions weren't dead and every day I would find interesting people to play with and party up with. Now, maps are relatively quiet and empty, and you never get the party invites and friendliness that there used to be. People just farm to themselves and the amount of people playing has dropped so much that I feel like I'm playing on empty servers all of the time. People don't even bother talk to you and in the major cities all you find is afk players just sitting there waiting for you to rank up their fame. Gameplay has also changed for the worse too. Back then there were relatively few and DISTINCTIVE classes that were unique and gave the game a balanced and helpful feel. Nowadays there is just a bunch of classes that are very similar and their niches are intertwined so much that you feel like class choice doesn't really give you a new and fun experience anymore. They've also emphasized microtransactions too much that it just takes away from the game. Overall, you feel like you're playing in a largely empty singleplayer game that's not even fun because the social aspect has completely rotted to nonexistence and the large amounts of ""events"" that fail at trying to make the game more interesting. The game has died and I must admit that even if you pay lots of money to level up and look cool, it doesn't matter a single ounce in the end because you've wasted your hard earned captical on a game with a meaningless and dead world and community."

2: keep grinding by killing monsters with the same buttons but with different effects.
3: Even more grinding
4: not even close to the end babyyyy
5: wow u get 1% exp each hour now
Result: you got your character to max lvl? congrats! you wasted like 3 months of your life for no reason.
TBH
If your new to the game, i recommend just look up a guide to farming exp, quests are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ useless. (Most of them at least) and most of the times, you'll find yourself just killing the same monsters over and over again for the next like week.
Why did I give this game a recommended review? Idk, im a no-life scrub, what else can I do?

To this day I hold onto the hope that one day we'll get a Maplestory Classic.

There was something incredible about the slow process of leveling up, getting money the old fashioned way through questing and the social aspects of doing Party Quests together... Hitting Henesys PQ and working your way up to Kerning and Ludibrium etc etc... It was an incredible journey that felt satisfying and memorable.

The game in it's current state today is... different... still fun! don't get me wrong, but it does feel a bit like a hollow shell of it's former self, I'd say from my experience the leveling up process heavily relies on soloing maps and sadly, the game went from ""let's work together"" to "" MOVE CHANNEL PLZ""

I still recommend playing it tho! The game is vibrant and colourful, the soundtrack is probably one of my all time favourites! (honestly, I still often listen to it even whilst playing other games or when doing other stuff! check it out!), and overall there's still LOTS of content to explore and play through!

I'll go back to my original point tho... The game could definitely use a WoW style reboot in the realms of a ""Classic"" style server, or an ""Oldschool Runescape"" type thing...

Whether if it does or doesn't happen one day, I'll never know... But I'll always cherish the good times and the many great memories I've had growing up with this game :)"

ATTENTION EUROPEAN PLAYERS: Avoid playing on European servers at all costs, it's trash. Just play on the NA one, the european server lags like crazy. Especially if you've got strong internet, in that case you won't feel any lag in NA, while there'll always be lag on the european server, as it's the server's problem.

I don't want to beg for ""likes"", but please upvote this review so people can be aware of this.

Thank you in advance :)

Edit: I recently came back to MapleStory and remembered this review, so I should update to let you know that the EU server no longer lags and it's absolutely fine to play in. HOWEVER, be aware that Maple Story has always been many times more popular in the USA than in Europe, so our server is nowhere near a populated as the american one"

Been playing casually for many years and I probably have 1000+ hours. So if you are starting this game in 2022, STAY AWAY!!! It is a fun game, however the time and dedication required to see progress is definitely not sustainable and there are better games/things you can do with your time. I honestly and wholeheartedly believe the developers and management team of Nexon is deliberately trying to destroy this game. Whether it's lack of communication with the player base or even just terrible implementation of new and old content, it is not worth it at all to start playing this game in 2022 -- for both the regular servers (heavily inclined to P2W) and the reboot (F2P) servers. Once again, STAY AWAY."

You can play this game for over 1000 hours and still not be close to end-game. It's fun for a little while (much less time than my personal time indicates), but don't waste a penny on this game. The game is designed so that you will only be able to keep up if you NEVER take a break, or you spend an absurd amount of money. There are multiple important items that are time-limited (e.g. Pets with auto-potion, auto-loot, and auto-buff... let me tell you, you NEED all 3 of these things once you are past level 200, the game is horrendous without them). You can acquire these things from events or from the cash shop, but either way you acquire them will have an expiration date, INCLUDING pets that cost $100. Speaking of the cash shop, you will also never be able to make your character look decent unless you spend money. There are some event reward cosmetics, but they all just look like clown attire.

If you do want to play, play on the Reboot server, make a Hyper Burning character, enjoy the early-to-mid game bosses (Lotus was the last boss I enjoyed fighting, most players will get bored way sooner than this), and then drop the game FOREVER. Or, you know, just play dozens of better games with the time that you would have wasted on this one."

I started playing this game when pirates came out. I used to love this game I really did. What I loved the most out of this game was the sense of being part of a community. The community is still active with an estimated 50,000-70,000 players but will continue to dwindle since less people join the game than there are leaving. I left because I didn't like the direction the game was taking.

I can't say if the game is still worth playing.. All but one server, the Reboot server, are pay to win. If you have the time to do mindless grinding then the Reboot server is for you (keep in mind that you cannot trade anything in this server). Find yourself a guild and hopefully you find some nice people to chat with. I don't recommend joining the non-reboot servers anymore as the majority of the old veterans are one of the most elitist and toxic players out there, and that's coming from the veteran player I am. Pretty much the normal servers are kept alive by the whales who spend tons of money in the game still. Anyone willing to pay can to be on top but I decided to not spend the money myself, it seems pointless and unfun instead of working towards progressing your character yourself.

One of the things I really disliked about this game was the introduction of the potential system. Potential widened the gap between rich and poor players. It divided the community even further. There are a ton of potential related items in the cash shop that give an unfair advantage to players with lots of money to drop in non-Reboot servers. Reboot is just a band-aid for the problem potentials created in this game. Reboot is a server Nexon created that solved many pay to win aspects, however this comes with many drawbacks, including the inability to trade with one another within the server. Another problem I saw was that Nexon was nerfing party related quests and raids, it was encouraging people to go solo instead of partying with other people which is what I loved from this game (as of today you'll rarely see anyone doing party quests, most people are grinding now instead of doing PQs/Boss Runs/Raids to level up). Now that the damage cap has been removed there is little reason to party with others to do stuff if you're decently funded. One other minor problem I saw is that Nexon created tons of servers, there was no reason to create more, the population wasn't even increasing and it further divided the playerbase. They finally merged many of the barren servers into single servers but are still even less populated than the top 3 populated non Reboot servers.

The game gets minor updates monthly with the occasional major update every now and then, so the game is still alive in that aspect. Thanks to Nexon Korea's ongoing support for the game, there's many more things to do than you could do in old MapleStory which is one of the few things this MMO has going.

I cannot recommend this MMO, but if you really want to try it out, go join the Reboot server, it is the most populated server and hopefully you find some nice people to chat with.

TL:DR
The game is extremely pay to win if you're not playing the Reboot server (keep in mind that you cannot trade in this server). I recommend joining the reboot server only if youre willing to try the game out. The game has an average of 50000-70000 players at the moment."

I remember buying this game for my brother a few years back. Didn't think much of it at the time, but I thought it would be a nice gift for him. I remember seeing him playing it from time to time, the message indicating that he'd started playing it popping up on the corner of my screen. There was always a certain small pride in seeing that, because to me it meant that he was enjoying my gift.
Last September he committed suicide.
After everything had more or less settled down from that, I sat down and booted up his computer. All that was on there was Chrome, Steam, Word, and a few games. One of them, of course, was Stardew Valley.
He had played this game to pieces, clocking over 170 hours and owning practically everything the game had to offer. He had used every square inch to its maximum potential, and was making ridiculous amounts of cash. It was only then did I see just how much he loved his present. No other game he played quite captured his affection as much as this one. None of his friends really knew about it, however; it seems like he preferred to keep it to himself. Like it was his own little bit of heaven he could turn to whenever he wanted.

And because of that, I can't help but smile whenever I play this game.

I cannot recommend it enough; every bit of hard work the developer put into this masterpiece shows in every single aspect. The music is catchy and memorable (i'll ofetn find myself humming certain tunes from it), the world feels lived-in and natural, and the gameplay is incredibly laid back and enjoyable. It's hard to stop once I get invested in the game; minutes can easily turn into several hours. And now, with the multiplayer beta, I play for even longer with my friends, each of us dedicated to our desired jobs. Most of all, however, we're all just happy to be together."

Although Stardew Valley has unmistakable similarities to Harvest Moon, it is a masterpiece in it's own right, one that is very dear to my heart after all those years playing with my mum.

Stardew Valley is complex and simple, heartwarming and detailed. It's complicated enough that so many hours later I still haven't completed most of the achievements or befriended most of the townsfolk, but it's simple and easy enough that I play it almost every night on the couch after work.

Concerned Ape has programmed a masterpiece; his story is just as heartwarming as the story he created. I anticipate each new release and I can't wait to see how far he takes this wonderful game. I rarely give games a perfect score, but this certainly deserves a ten out of ten."

Thank you.
I really hope the developers are able to find this review somehow.

We all have difficult times in our lives.

I started playing Stardew Valley in April 2021, which was not an easy moment in my life. Apart from the COVID pandemic, i was struggling with high anxiety/depression, college was online and the pressure, both from the university and myself, never stopped. It was hard. I cried a lot. But somehow i got through this.
I never played this kind of game before, sort of ""Harvest Moon""-like i guess. But i wanted to try something that i could just... Relax. Enjoy. Take a deep breath and calm my mind. Relieve the tension. Chill.

Stardew Valley, for me, was kind of... a life saver.
I'm still playing it (100h and counting) and the game still do what it did in the beginning: it's an incredibly charming and relaxing game, it's fun and it has likable characters, so far it has been an experience that i am very happy i gave it a shot.
It's one of my favorite indie games ever now. Right beside Bastion, Hollow Knight and Shovel Knight, other favorites of mine.

Stardew Valley calmed me when i needed most. And i will not forget that.

There isn't much to be said that hasn't already been said for this amazing game if you enjoyed the classic harvest moon type games you will absolutely 100% enjoy this. The game play seems fresh and fun even after clocking in over 60 hours, You won't want to quit, “Just 1 more day” then you realize that turned into 5 days and it's 4am and you have to sleep sometime.

This game, takes the old harvest moon concepts and tosses in a bit of Rune factory and a sprinkle of animal crossing leaving you with a sensational experience. Each day brings something fresh, There is over 25 different Npc's to interact with each day and each one brings their own charm and dialogue options depending on if you take the time to build up your friendships.

Your farm can be whatever you make it, You design what it looks like, how it runs, what you plant and what animals you choose to raise. The fishing can be a bit difficult to begin with but very rewarding and relaxing once you get the hang of it. On days you want something a bit different you can hop into the mine and find some rare gems, ores and minerals, Some that you can donate to the game's huge museum or use to upgrade your tools!

I can't praise this game enough, if your on the fence about purchasing this game or you think you should wait for a sale, Don't wait! This game was made by a single developer who deserves every single penny for all the obvious hard work and dedication. So go and farm your butt off!!!!"

If you're looking for a wholesome game that destroys your IRL health bar, look no further. The regularly satisfying hits of dopamine will cause addiction. You'll lose sleep due to the ""Just one more day"" factor. You'll strain your eyes. Your most visited website will change. The existential crisis that will awaken in you for enjoying a pixelated, 2-D world more than your reality will send you down a path of reflection and, in most cases, enlightenment. Probably."

This is a game that I have been looking forward to for at least 2 and a half years. I have wanted to have a game on the PC that had the elements of harvest moon (for the little bit I played of it), Animal crossing (<3) and Rune factory. I was super excited when I was approached by Leth (publishing manager at Chucklefish) at the beginning of December to help him and ConcernedApe (developer of the game) with bug testing and QA. 400+ hours later (off steam and on steam), I still love the game.

Farming. The farming is fantastic. It is to me one of the main elements of the game, and it's just a joy. Being able to design your farm any way you want it... yes please. Planning out what to buy every season, where to plant them, on top of the thrill of when you can harvest and reap on the gold... it's so enjoyable and addictive.

Fishing. The fishing is outstanding. From playing WoW and Runescape.. or any game with fishing, the fishing in Stardew Valley is so much fun. At first, the fishing is challenging, but as you progress your skill, you become a pro in no time.

Mining and combat. Mining and combat is incredible. Going deeper into the mines can be tough, but if you're prepared with your food and weapon in hand, you can fend off the creatures and get your sweet ore/minerals/gems that you want to bring back to your house and possibly hoard. (Hi, I'm Bexy, and i'm a hoarder.)

Social. Social interactions are great. Being able to become friends with the people in the town, and eventually being able to get into relationships with people and having a family with them.. what's not to like about that? And what's great is that it gives great replayability because you can have different saves with different spouses! The backstory for each of the characters too is so in depth and well thought out, you will be silly if you don't shed a tear maybe once or twice.

The actual main story is well rewarding, and once you ""complete"" it, you can still continue on your adventures and farming life with no problems, hell you might even discover new things afterwards, I sure as hell did!

Yes, I was a tester for the game. Yes, I have played for ridiculous amounts of hours. It may feel like i'm being a bit overzealous with this. However you have to remember, I was a tester. I tested the crap out of every aspect with this game, even though there were massive game breaking bugs, errors, glitches, crashes. I still love this game. I reported many a bug, and ConcernedApe was quick to fix them.

And that's the thing, not only is the game amazing, the developer is too. ConcernedApe works around the clock to make sure that bugs are fixed in quick time in order for us to have an amazing experience with this game. And that's true. The experience that you have with this game IS amazing.

Minutes playing turn into hours. Hours turn into ""oh no it's time to sleep"".
You will forget about time. You will forget about sleep. You will forget that dinner was about 5 hours ago but you couldn't' remember because you were too busy trying to fight off 12 bats that were clobbering you inside the mines while trying to gather that 1 diamond waaaaay in the back.

So yes, I without a shadow of a doubt 150% recommend this game to anyone that wants to ""escape"" for days on end with what I am classifying as my #1 Game of 2016."

If you look at the playtime above this review, you might be thinking to yourself... ""How on earth does one person invest 400 hours of their life into a game about farming?"" Well, it's a lot easier than you think.

Stardew Valley opens with our disillusioned protagonist slaving away at a corporate job, only to be reminded of a promise that they had made with their grandfather so many years ago. A promise of something to brighten the shadows when life becomes too dreary for them. Our stalwart protagonist waves goodbye to the grey walls of their office to board a train to Stardew Valley, an unknown paradise far away from the city. And it is here, where their life truly begins.

I can only wish that we all find our Stardew Valley someday. Yee-haw."

I convinced my brother to help me buy our mom a PS4 last Christmas so she could play Stardew Valley. She was playing the same Animal Crossing game on Wii for years, so getting her to try something new was risky.

After my brother showed her the TV apps, mom humored me and let me teach her how to play. She made a farm, and sort of caught on to using tools.

It’s August now. She’s logged over 500 hours into that farm. Her cellar is packed with kegs, the seashore is red with crab pots. She wields a flashy Return Scepter that I’ve never even gotten.

INTRODUCTION

Stardew Valley.

I've heard a lot of things about this game. A lot of extremely positive things.

And I was doubtful. Was Stardew Valley really that good? I was afraid that people were just giving it attention because they didn't actually know what a good game was. And as insulting as it may sound, in my defense, uhhm....

Before buying the game I hadn't really seen what it looked like, or knew what it was about. I just knew that it was published by the same company, Chucklefish, that had developed Starbound. I had loved Starbound.. So I was playing completely spoiler free. Haven't watched any videos, no tips & tricks, just the information of a billion recommended reviews stuffed into my head.

So I bought Stardew Valley, and had pretty high expectations. If a game received THAT much popularity, it should be seriously good, right?



Plop. Into the world of Stardew Valley.

You completely start from the bottom, trailing after a tragedy and responsibility that's struck. A farm, barely any money, and the mystery of a town left in your hands. Whew. That's really a lot when you think about it.


Boy, did I NOT know what I was getting myself into.


At first, I was mesmorized. Or maybe lost is a better word. The beginning's all new and immersive, and the middle... kind of leaves you stuck. But, this is because I was impatient with the game. I went in wanting to finish it asap. However, I realized this game is NOT simply for you to buy and finish. It's something else... entirely.

The thing with Stardew Valley, It's all about exploration and management. Discovering and figuring out secrets and a beautiful story was amazing. Creative mechanics and powerful creativity had combined to produce a fabulous well-formed game that leaves a sweet taste in your mouth, and I'm going to tell you right now... it's totally addicting.

I bought the game a few days ago, and literally have played it all day since. I've NEVER done that with a game before. I found myself as a kid in a candy shop, gaping at all the different flavors, and being able to savor them all. And now, in Year 3 of the game.. I still have a lot more to discover.



Compared to others, I've only played around 130 hours of the game thus far. Buy Stardew Valley. You really won't regret it. This game is beautiful. The music is whimsically lifting, and the soundtrack is wonderful. It's a work of art. You will find yourself falling in love with the characters, and the daily routine of being a farmer who restores the life around people, and who changes everyone for the better. It's so relaxing, so addicting, and so much fun. I have played games for years, played games with far more hours than I have with Stardew Valley- and yet, I always turn to Stardew Valley first. Why? It's amazing. It offers something to everyone.

The game rewards for the hard-working. Stardew Valley is a game where you really have to manage things, yet, it allows you to explore the whole art of it. Work hard as you play the game, and there are sweet rewards. And I'm talking about rewards sweeter than all the candy in that candy shop.

Here's the thing: you can take two routes with Stardew Valley. You can either take the money route and become rich and miss half the game, or you can immerse yourself in exploring the town and what the game has to offer, but with also missing the point that Stardew is a management farming game.

Or, you can successfully find the balance between both. But how?

Stardew Valley allows you to store multiple accounts, which is fantastic. I recommend exploring with your first account, and learning the ropes. You seriously won't know anything yet, and will be like ""OMFG"" when you figure out there's a way that makes things one hundred times easier. After that, create a second account, and start figuring out farm management and what the game has to offer. This is a game in which you learn from your mistakes.

And now... I'm left in a spot where I can successfully thrive, and only continue to grow.



- Enchanting music that sings as you play

- A simple yet fun art design that you can't help but fall in love with

- Characters whom capture your heart

- A shambled town that begins to thrive

- Hidden secrets that you can't help but want to keep discovering

- Amazing challenges that leave you wanting more

- Brilliant originality, which is incredibly difficult to find

- A storyline that changes your perspective beautifully

- Lots of fun, and I mean .

- Mods created by the community to make your game more fun and immersive- however, I play without mods.

- IT FINALLY HAS MULTIPLAYER!



- As I said, the game rewards you for hard work. But only for hard work. It can be a grueling process, but it is extremely profitable. Those who don't like putting effort into a game won't enjoy Stardew Valley as much as other games.

- Time. Stardew Valley takes a lot of time to play through. It's a game you thoroughly have to enjoy and adventure out on.

- Repetitive. The game can be grueling. To reach certain goals you have to go through processes that you will SERIOUSLY hate. But, in the end, it's definitely worth the labor.




- I wish there would be more characters. Once you go through the storyline with everyone, there's not much lore left.

- More secrets and new areas, of course!



Stardew Valley offers a lot of things, and has changed the lives of many people. Perhaps in peace, wonder, open-mindedness, the game gives a lot. But I have one thing that's been bothering me for a long time... How in the damn world did one single person spit out a freaking awesome game?

Even though it's a farming game, which is commonly found everywhere, it's original with its own spins. It's extremely difficult to find a game that has such a captivating message that's been developed so well. Stardew Valley is a lot of fun and awe, and it really draws a blank in your mind.

Buy Stardew Valley. At first, it might seem mediocre... but keep playing. Trust me, the candies are still sweet. And they really only get sweeter."

Spoiler free review, with a short and a longer version:

Buy this game if:

+ You're interested in farming, even though you're allowed to make that it isn't 100% of the core gameplay;
+ You were looking for a long, yet various and easy to be resumed game;
+ You're fond of pixelated indie games;
+ You can bear resource hunting and you have some patience, as there are some RPG and crafting gameplay;
+ You love games that are supported by modders and regularly updayed by the developer himself (Update 1.5 - see longer review part down below)

Don't buy the game if those above points aren't significant for you;






Longer version:
Let's see now the most important points, including the DLC, described in the 6th bullet point:

1-
Your grandpa, who lived the last part of his life is Stardew Valley has passed away and you as his nephew/niece have inherited a plot of land in Stardew Valley itself. Bored and saddened by the repetitive and dull life that you're spending working in a big firm (feel free to imagine it as Amazon/Nestlè)... you decide to accept the inheritance and embark in this new life and adventure.

2-
Even though clearing debris, pruning weeds, killing evil monsters and cutting trees is fun and necessary up to a certain point, you're not ""forced"" to keep farming 24/7, as the game is full of side activities who can be remunerative and of course fun, such as:
- tending to animals;
- mining;
- foraging;
- fishing:
- more...

3-
this means that besides customizing your own home, buildings and clothes there is a skill system, which can shape and improve the way on how you've decided to play the game;

4-
The NPCs are actually interesting and they're worth your time, socializing with them, helping them and confronting them on events, quests is always a good distraction and worth your time, as they'll be quite rewarding in terms of money, items and story progression in general, even though you're not forced to follow any particular path. Your actions have consequences that will also change the landscape and the city.

5-
I personally recommend Stardew Valley Expanded as a mod to be installed, feel free to check it on Nexusmods

6-
my biggest gripe with SV this free massive update from December 2020 was that there wasn't enough end-gameplay elements or goals to be reached. This update addressed completely these issues by adding a new whole area, distant from Stardew Valley, by adding new minerals, animals, crops, quests, weekly quests, npcs and much more, including many quality of life changes, which make the gameplay much smoother and fluid.

I spent three years building up hype, and I was still blown away.

If you enjoyed Harvest Moon, Rune Factory or Animal Crossing - then get this. It captures all the same things that made those games great, and it's the perfect game to play either casually or seriously. There are so many different ways to earn money and they're all developed and fun, the hardest part is choosing which one to spend your time doing.

The progression curve in the game is fantastic too. Every day you'll feel like you're making progress but there's still always something to work towards and you won't 'beat it' after a couple of hours earning as much money as possible, as there's always something to spend your money on. Even after 20 hours of playing, I feel like I'm nowhere near the endgame, and I could easily see myself playing through again and doing things differently. I'm even doing a playthrough on YouTube and the progress feels dramatically different even in its early stages.

I'm easily disappointed by games, so you can imagine my surprise when I was so impressed by a game made by one person. Congratulations, ConcernedApe, you've made one of the best games I've ever played."

Overview

Stardew Valley is a game that borrows heavily from similar titles in the Harvest Moon series. You start out in a rural town with nothing but a dilapidated house and crop fields that are more akin to the wilderness than a place to grow vegetables. The game is simple in its understanding: build a farm, make profits, live your life. What the game allows you to do makes it so much more layered. You're left with the freedom to explore the town, its residence, mold your farm into whatever you want it to be and on your own time. Sure, there are events to attend, festivals to see, men/women to romance and marry, kids to have, buildings to construct, fish to catch and weird little slimes to slay (Dragon Warrior, anyone?), but how and when you do those things is up to you.

In essence, the game offers you very similar things to do as a Harvest Moon game does: Build and upgrade your farm, plant crops, upgrade tools, mine in the never-ending dungeon for precious ore, go fishing, romance and get married...etc. While some of your old favorites are back, new aspects have been introduced as well, but I won't spoil those in this review. Let's just say there's a nice story that evolves over time.

The freedom to do as you please is what makes this game, and Harvest Moon in general, so enjoyable. It's a chance to mellow out, play at your own pace and still enjoy everything the game has to offer. What Stardew Valley does, it does right. It's charming, cute and feels rewarding, even when all you're doing is cuttings weeds. It doesn't pull any punches or try to be something its not; the developer had a goal in mind and Stardew Valley is a reflection of just that. You can feel the effort, the time and the devotion that went into this game over the years. Stardew Valley is a gem and worth looking at. If you loved Harvest Moon, you'll love Stardew Valley.

To date, Stardew Valley is a single player game, though the developer as mentioned some form of co-op or multiplayer availability in the future.











Overall, Stardew Valley is a pleasure. I haven't put a ton of time into it (yet), but I easily see that happening. It's fun, lighthearted and addictive. As I said earlier in this review, if you've ever played Harvest Moon, you'll enjoy Stardew Valley. It's worth checking out and I highly recommend it. This will easily become one of my most played games on my list. You won't be disappointed, so check it out!"

It's winter, you have a weekend and you don't need to go anywhere. It's so peacefully quiet outside. You brewed yourself hot tea along with fragrant pastries. You make yourself comfortable by the warm fireplace wrapped in a blanket and play Stardew Valley. Your farm is wonderful. You are the happiest person."

I was never interested in farming games. I’ve never played a Harvest Moon game or an Animal Crossing game, and never had any interest in them. The closest thing to a farming game I’ve ever played was Minecraft. I definitely would have never tried Stardew Valley if I wasn’t an achievement hunter and it didn’t have achievements.

But now I see what all the hype was about.

Stardew Valley is a game that is very easy to lose oneself into. There are many elements of the game that feel intimately relatable to real life, especially the game’s premise: you’re stuck at a soul-crushing corporate office job when your grandfather dies, leaving you an envelope telling you to open it only when you’ve reached your absolute limit and need something new. After a particularly bad day at work, you finally decide to open the envelope and find a deed to your grandfather’s farm on a far-off island, so you take the plunge and decide to move there. It is a very strong analogy to the game itself, where you, the player, are seeking escapism from your daily life and decide to take the plunge into this game, not knowing what else to expect.

In Stardew Valley, you will find your new home upon a sizable but absolutely trashed plot of land. As the days go by, you can clean up the land and discover hundreds of ways to make a profit with what you’ve been given, from buying seeds and planting crops, to raising animals, to fishing (by means of a surprisingly pleasant and addictive quicktime event), to foraging for wild food, and even to exploring a few combat-centric Zelda-style dungeons. But you’re not making money for its own sake – there are dozens of mysterious secrets scattered about the land, each with significant and game-changing rewards at the end, and you need to raise the money and resources to investigate them all. The game experience is going to be totally different for everybody depending on what game elements you are inspired to pursue first. Although you’ll assuredly be looking at a wiki in due time, it is deeply satisfying to go in blind and piece things together yourself for as long as you can.

Years consist of four months, each month being 28-day season. Some gameplay mechanics change with the seasons, particularly that certain crops only grow in certain seasons, and (almost) no crops grow in winter, so you’ll have to carefully consider what seeds to plant and when. Each day lasts about five minutes, and you’ve got to make sure you’re back in your house by 2AM, or else you’ll pass out and lose some money. The biggest way the game hooks you is the fact that your progress is only saved at the of a day – so if you’re eager to wake up in the morning and harvest your crops, it won’t mean anything unless you play the whole day through. A vicious cycle! I clocked 120 hours of this game in the first 2 weeks of playing. That’s how bad it is.

Another one of the game’s strengths is the cozy little community you live beside, with a population of about 25 people. The game does a wonderful job of making each character feel like their own entity, with their own daily routines and backstories and motivations. You’ll really get to know and love them. You can give gifts to characters to increase friendship level with them, unlocking character development cutscenes and important rewards. You can even date some of them (you can have 6 boyfriends and 6 girlfriends at once if you want, no joke; relationships are gender-indiscriminate) and then marry the character of your choice. The social aspect is sometimes a bit too real – you’ll feel the pain of rejection all too often – but that makes the successful relationships all the more heartwarming.

As for complaints: surprisingly, the game has some strange and baffling bugs, most of which are visual (like ice-skating horses), but some which affect gameplay, and a few known save-corruption bugs. I also felt consistently uncomfortable with the controls. If you're using the mouse, your cursor needs to always be in proximity of your character, or else you'll only aim at the tile in front of you, making it very easy to abruptly turn the wrong direction while working. And if you accidentally click the wrong tile, your character will turn to face it, changing the default direction you aim, compounding the problem. It can be infuriating, especially if it causes you to accidentally destroy crops. Also, I don't like how you can only talk to NPCs if you have a tool selected, and how you'll use a consumable item at the same time as opening a door if you have one selected. The controls could definitely use some additional polish.

Then there are the inventory controls. If you click on an inventory item, you pick it up and you can drop it in a different inventory slot. If you click on an inventory item with a storage box open, you will immediately transfer the item into (or out of) the box. Thus, it is impossible to organize the inventory with a storage box open. If you click on an inventory item while in a shop, . I can't tell you the amount of times I purchased 200 seeds, then immediately sold them again just because I tried to pick them up and put them in a different slot.

Also, I can’t help but feel the game should have even more content than it already does – perhaps more dungeons, a bigger map, and the ability to run more than one farm. But (as of this writing) the game is still in active development, including a co-op multiplayer patch in the works, and a lively modding community.

I give this game an 8/10. A wonderful example of what all those crappy Farmville mobile games would be like if they were actually balanced around gameplay and not milking the player with microtansactions and daily login bonuses. Despite some stupidly distracting bugs and annoying controls, it’s some simply wonderful escapism, and made me finally see the appeal in a farming game. It does get stale in time, but not before offering a huge amount of joy. For achievement hunting, it’ll easily take about 200 hours, especially blind… but if you’re like me, you’ll have it over with in a month or two. A huge thumbs-up."

Originally, when I was younger and inconsiderate, I pirated this game and sunk in at least 100 hours. Once I had my own money, I bought this game on Steam when the multiplayer update came out. I played a lot with my girlfriend at the time, and when we broke up, I stopped playing for a while and deleted the save. A few months later I was in a low place, so I bought this game on Switch and completed the story and got married, and had kids (so I sunk in a fair amount of hours ~200) It was the only thing motivating me to look after myself as I wanted to keep playing. As I recovered from that dark part of my life, I played less and less until a friend mentioned they wanted to play with me. So now I've been chilling on a farm with my friend through lockdown. This game as a whole has helped me through a lot, and has given me a bunch of great memories. I recommend Stardew Valley to anyone that likes Harvest Moon, farming sims in general, or just having a great time. The music is stellar and the art style is nice and fits with the game. Generally a great experience!!"

Stardew Valley is literally the first game that I bought in seconds, with the full price, without thinking. I was a Harvest Moon lover, I really, really wanted to have a PC game like HM, and Oh my.
ConcernedApe, you sir, are one of the most amazing developers, both in terms of actual developing, and keeping up with the date as well. There are a lot of games out there that were abondened by their devs, but our supreme leader listens. Makes it happen. And I am oh so greatful.
The story, the characters, the customization, mods that you can get, amount of things you can do in this games is just amazing, also, it is, IT REALLY IS, Beautiful~ You can see in the wiki, how the NPC development went, you can feel the time this game was given by this person, and he deserves every single penny and every single praise for it.

Do you see this play time??? And I still haven't 100 percented this thing. There is so much content here, and you get it all with one purchase! No DLC! Nothin'! Concerned Ape, do you have some aversion to money!?

All joking aside, this is a fantastic game. Hundreds of hours of content in this little pixel art game about farming and bringing a dying town back to life. The most recent update just added a bunch of new late game content (which was the only gripe I had with this game up until this point) You can play this for years and not run out of stuff to do (and I have)

I grew up playing Harvest Moon on the SNES. My parents probably rented the game a dozen+ times before putting up the money to just buy the damn game. My brother and I dumped hours, and hours, and hours into that game. Beating it multiple times to see some of the different endings.


A few years ago, for the first time, a game was released that bested the original Harvest Moon. That game is obviously Fortnite. JK


Stardew Valley is such a good spiritual successor, that it beats the original hand over fist. It's entirely it's own game, while nodding its head to what I assume is its source inspiration. It exceeded my expectations by a lot, and it continues to be improved on again and again.


This game has a lot of replayability (just ask my wife who has nearly 1000 hours logged by now). Between different relationships, different focuses, different game altering choices, and different property layouts and designs. There's enough content to keep you entertained and coming back for a very long time.


It might seem minor, but the games soundtrack is probably one of the best, if not THE best out there. Chrono Cross was my former favorite, but only Stardew Valley has led to me purchasing the soundtrack on digital and two different vinyl releases (okay, one of those was a gift). It keeps the game from getting as monotonous as it MIGHT otherwise get sometimes. Its similar to the Tetris song. After enough playing, the music is ingrained in my soul. Lmao


Gorgeous pixel graphics. Amazing variety and loads of charm. The creator clearly has a deep passion for this game and it shows in nearly every way.


This game deserves so much more money and appreciation than it gets.


11/10 - stop ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ around and buy the game already. I dont care if you find farming boring.

PS - shout out to my brother. He never got to experience this masterpiece, but at least we had good times on Harvest Moon. He would have loved it. RIP 1987-2007"

This game is dangerous.

When I first started playing I was like, ""It's cool, farming is fun but I don't really see the hype around it.""

Then I kept playing.

It's gotten so bad that I have 10 tabs open just to look up stuff on the wiki for this game. I open the game and blink and two hours have passed, and while I feel sad that I just lost so much time, I look at the progress I made on my farm and think, ""Worth.""

This is one of the most fun games I've ever played.

It's designed in such a way that it allows both casual players and competitive / optimization-oriented players to have a blast with this game. There is so much to do in this game, and there's so much to offer. You can spend your days farming, fishing, mining, foraging, talking to the villagers, etc. The game is made in a way in which you don't have to hyper-optimize every little detail like min-maxing profit, time management, etc, because there's no time limit for things (unless you count seasons, but there's always another year) and there's no stakes. But if you want to, you definitely can.

Talking to the villagers is fun as well, they're well-designed, and you can even find patterns in their daily schedules. There's a lot of details in this game.

I haven't tried the multiplayer, but from what I've seen it can definitely be a lot more fun with friends. But playing solo is extremely fun as well.

My only gripe with the game is that it's a huge time sink. I waited until my semester was over to get into it because I heard about the time sink beforehand, and I was glad I waited, because all I can think about now is, ""What crops am I going to plant next season? Where I should place them? How much money am I making from these? Should I fish or mine? Did I feed my animals today? DID I TALK TO ROBIN TODAY?""

And of course, Robin is best girl, no discussion there."

There are plenty of games out there that might give you a higher high. Getting the highest score in a lobby of some FPS for example.

This game is nothing short of straight BEAUTY. I have never played a farming sim before this, and honestly I thought I wouldn't like it because it was so different from the games I usually played at the time (FPS). As soon as I cracked it open, I felt the joy of 100 perfect headshots of a PvP match light up my cerebral cortex as my brain was melted by the gracious and time-taking beauty of Stardew Valley. The amazing 16-bit design of the character portraits, freshly tilled ground, and don't get me started on the fishing. Without any guides, I made 15,000 Gold before Winter, and even with watching guides, you never feel like you're cheating yourself, because there's just so much joy to it that it is impossible to ruin the game with watching videos about (spoiler) and (spoiler). I was amazed to learn that this was created by ONE GUY, Mr. Eric Barone. May whatever God he believe in bless his soul, as he has blessed mine with this amazing game.

As you can see from my hours played I adore this game.

Whenever I search for a new game I go to the reviews and I make sure that the majority of the reviewers have played for more than 100 hours. Amount of hours played gives a game credibility in my opinion.

I have played and played and played Stardew Valley in many ways.

I have tried all of the maps, explored every inch, and grew to know every character.

Tonight my hubby and I are delving into the multiplayer beta and I still feel thrilled as if it was my first time playing.

The music is relaxing, the atmosphere is enjoyable, really everything about this game is made for one such as me.
I have a four year old and at night after bedtime I hop on my computer to calm down after the day. I nearly always go for Stardew Valley to really destress. (Though recently I have been attached to My Time at Portia lol), but still I come back to Stardew.

Every new time I play I try to knock out another steam challenge or two.

I try to woo new characters.

I try to keep it fresh.

And, thus far I still love this game as much as I did the first time I opened it."

By admission of the dev himself, this game is Harvest Moon at its core. A formula that is purely addictive and satisfying as hell.

But there is something Stardew Valley has over Harvest Moon, and that's a heart. The intro to the game is incredibly human and relatable. I sympathized with my character right off the bat. I think we all know how it feels to want to escape the mundane grind, and in a funny kind of way, this game does that.

A moment I felt that the game truly had a soul was when I was walking to the mines on a rainy day, when suddenly I was greeted by a cutscene of coming upon Abigail, my romance interest, playing a flute next to the lake. It's a very quiet scene, with nothing but the sound of rain and her flute playing. After some dialog, my character (who is a silent protagonist by the way) pulls out a mini harp and joins Abby in a duet, something that really surprised me as there was no indication that my character had any musical talent prior to this scene. It was a bonding experience, and it felt incredibly real, memorable, and touching. I'll always remember it.

And when you realize that there are TEN love interests in this game with different scenes like this for each of them, man, that's an intimidating amount of content.

Maybe I shouldn't be saying that Harvest Moon doesn't have any heart at all, but when it comes down to it, this is the game that I'm going to remember more fondly in the end. I made memories with Harvest Moon as a child. Now I'm making memories with Stardew Valley as an adult. You should too. The game is worth full price and then some."

It's a cute and relaxing game but it was surprisingly short. I feel like it ended abruptly.

Would be worth waiting and buying it on sale(more than 50% off) because it's pretty expensive imo for the amount of playtime you get.

I have 4.3 hours on here but I did go through a second time for achievements, so it's even shorter than that.

Apparently there's no intention of adding anymore to the game too which just pushes the fact that you should wait until a decent amount of money is off the game before you purchase it."

Great game but I wish there was a free-play mode with randomized rooms to unpack. As-is, the game feels a bit lacking in content. The story is cute and fun, but when I was through with it, I just felt disappointed, like there should have been more.

I'd say this game was worth the price if finishing the story unlocked some other game play modes or something, but it just... ends. And the replay value isn't very high. Once the story is done, that's just kinda it. No reason to leave it on your device, just uninstall and download something else.

Hopefully the devs add something more to this because the gameplay itself is great.

I'd only recommend getting it on a decent sale at this point because it's a very short a one-and-done right now."

Definitely a relaxing game, however 20$+ for barely 2-3 hours of gameplay is very overpriced. I wish there was more to it, especially since among the very few levels, some only have a room or two.

I'd love to see more levels in the future, or even unpack for a whole new family. Basically, this game needs more content before it's worth the price."

The game took less than 3 hours to complete. I've been following the game for years so it's a little disappointing to be finished all the content in one little sitting.

Otherwise a great game. Very relaxing. Wonderful music.

I really hope that the game will be expanded."

The biggest negative to this game: far too short.
Unpacking is relaxing and fun, and tells a sweet story - nothing wild or huge, just the path of one person's life as they move. I enjoyed seeing what objects carried over through the years and what items got left behind or replaced. It was heartwarming to see how the person grew and what she achieved by looking through her things. I was a little disappointed that there was only this one story, however. Around 7 places to unpack, of varying lengths/difficulties, and then the game is over.

I received this game as a gift, but i do think $20 is a high price point for the 4 hours of game play. If the story struck a huge note with me or if there were different difficulties or things i could improve for replay, i might change my tune, but as it stands, after 4 hours i have seen what there is to see in this game. I would love if there were more levels, maybe based around a different person, or even if steam workshop could make custom levels or items so that players could create their own stories.

TL;DR : fun game, i recommend buying on sale."

The music, the story, and the graphics are pretty nice.
Big minus, not enough content for this price - after a few hours you will be done.

Introduction:
Unpacking is a casual, very cosy little game that has you placing items about your in-game house. To describe it, it is actually very hard to make it sound interesting, and yet it is. I played the entire game in one sitting and wished there was more at the end. It’s a small gem – very cute, very casual, and very relaxing.


X Steep price for playtime. About 4 hours, for $15/£15. I’d wait for a sale.
X Short.
X Not particularly replayable.


+ Cute graphical style.
+ Achievements that are easy to get.
+ Nice background story.
+ Relaxing.
+ Easy to play.
+ Doesn’t require powerful hardware.

Unpacking has a very cute graphical style that is hard to place. Everything is made of pixels (I know that’s true literally but… you know what I mean). It is soft on the eyes, with a gentle colour palette and interesting environments. Rooms are probably tidier than anyone’s actually is in real life, but I soon saw to that.

I really enjoyed the visual style of this game. I think, like so much else about it, ‘cosy’ is an apt description. The only small flaw I could mention is that on some rare occasions, I couldn’t tell what an item was, and because everything is designed in ‘pixels’, zooming in didn’t help. This is not a massive issue though, I worked out what the items were in the end anyway. I only went around all of the rooms waiting for the game to accept a location placement for them…

The game works as if items are placed on an invisible grid of sorts. It is not restrictive at all, and so not a downside, but movement and placement of items isn’t completely ‘free’. They have to snap to positions on surfaces. Some of these items can only go on certain surfaces and the game will alert you to this after you have unpacked everything, but in the main you are free to place anything where you like, and so you are free to approach the gameplay as you like. Some will make everything neat, and take their time about it, while others only care about keeping the bed clear so they can go to sleep that night, even if you would have to be a contortionist to get through all the rubbish on the floor to get there.

As you progress in the game, your living spaces get bigger and so you no longer unpack in just one room. It expands to a whole house. You can cycle through scenes with buttons on the far sides of the screen, but there’s also a floor plan you can pull up from a button at the top that shows you all the rooms on that floor. If it’s a big house, it’s easier to do that, and I appreciate they added this feature.

The gameplay is relaxing, and though the process of unpacking is repetitive in as far as clicking and dragging items across a screen, it is made engaging both by the variety of items, the changing locations, and the background story. Some objects can be interacted with too, often triggering achievements. This adds a nice layer of intrigue beyond just making rooms look tidy. Unpacking never felt boring to play.

Unpacking is actually quite good at environmental storytelling. More than being just a game where you unpack boxes, if you pay attention to the items that you unpack and the varying houses you do it in, you slowly observe a story unfolding. It is surprising how real the story felt, too, despite the lack of dialogue or characters in the game. Each room you unpack becomes a snapshot in time of a person’s life, and as the game plays on you start to get a feeling for this person’s highs and lows as you can observe the behind the scenes of their story. This was an unexpected but very rich addition to the game, I felt.

The music in the game is quite retro, I think. Some of the tracks are quite acoustic and have a light-hearted, summery ethos about them, while others are a little more upbeat. If you have ever played visual novels, certainly those with a romantic plot, the music reminded me a bit of that. I really enjoyed the soundtrack to this game, it set the cosy atmosphere off well.

Some items in game make noises, such as the microwave, when you interact with them. Placing things on surfaces and opening cupboards and similar such actions triggers sound effects too. On the whole, they’re quite minimal, but it really did have me feeling like I was at home alone on a summer afternoon, joyfully unpacking and settling into my new house. It was a lot more stress-free than the real thing…

For those that enjoy unpacking, but who have nowhere to go, this is the perfect game for you. It removes the discomfort of jetlag, the terror of finding spiders have set up a hotel in your house while you’ve been away, and the annoyance of having mess all over the floors for days on end, and instead substitutes it with all the best there is in unpacking – a small window of time where you can let your mind wonder and happily place your belongings aesthetically around your home.

Unpacking is a simple game that is fairly short. The price is a little steep and there’s not much replay value, but it still manages to have a strong sense of atmosphere tell a nice story while offering relaxing and fun gameplay. I would wait for a sale to make it better value, but otherwise I highly recommend this game.

A lovely game made by lovely people. The game play is relaxing, the music is great, and the art style is adorable.
There is however, one very large problem with the game. Its length.
I grapple with this issue a lot in gaming, artist should be able to charge what they see fit for their work and good art, even if small, should be worth it. But, the reality of it is that $20 can go much father and get you much much more on this platform, even from indie devs. The team can and should charge what they want, but after I realized after 3 hours I'd seen all there was to see, I can't lie, I was a bit let down. If there was more free content planned on the way I would be more understanding, but after some digging on the community page, the devs have flat out said that there isn't.

Long and short of it is, they should be able to charge what they want, but the shortness of the game, in MY opinion, paired with its price seems a bit unreasonable. Outside of that it is still a good game.
However, Games that have more to do and are cheaper on steam, by similar sized to even smaller teams are aplenty.
Grab this one on sale or if they lower the price. Or pay up. It's up to you."

the game itself is great, easy to learn mechanics, cute graphics, very relaxing and simple, decent soundtrack and nice plot (though it's barely apart of the game) but it really doesn't have much replay value (and it's only around 3 hours) yet it still costs 22$. if you wanna try the game, get it when it goes on sale"
unpacking,Recommended,3.4,"Posted: November 5, 2021
Harder to recommend but I do
The graphics are beautiful and the sound design and music aren't bad either.
I had a good time playing but as many others have pointed out it's quite short for the price with little to no replay value. Perhaps more game modes (like room design, competitive score based modes, an infinite or sandbox mode where you just unpack as much as you can into a set space, even just some extra levels, etc.) would lend it more longevity.

Having finished it I'm still not sure what some of the items were and it can be potentially irritating trying to figure out where things need to go at the end of a level when you don't know what they are so some item names/descriptions would be a handy addition if you hover over the item or once you've picked it up.

If you're looking for a zen experience you can lose yourself in that's not too long this is not a bad choice but I'd be inclined to wait for it to go on sale as it's quite pricey for what it is."

Overall I think Unpacking is a good game. It has a very cozy atmosphere and tells a sweet story, with an appealing art style and chill music. If you are looking for something not too challenging but still a logic puzzle of sorts to play after a day that's been just too demanding, Unpacking would fit the bill quite well.

My one big issue, same as many others have already said, is the price for the amount of content that is here. As of this review, I'm just under 4 hours of playtime, and I've already completed the game and unlocked every achievement, despite playing at a fairly relaxed pace. I would suggest getting this game on sale (ideally 50% off or better) if you are at all interested in it."
unpacking,Not Recommended,8.7,"Posted: November 20, 2021
Tl;dr: Wait for this game to go on sale.

The only reason I don't recommend this game is because it's extremely overpriced for what you get. It's very relaxing and it tells a heartfelt story of someone growing up and discovering themselves. But it costs twice as much as it should.

I completed the game in 3.5 hours then spent some time rewatching what I'd done to get to the 4.3 hours of play mark. There is little to no replay value, either, as it always tells the same story with the same items. I wish it had an endless/sandbox mode where it randomized items and room layouts, or let us choose the furniture or aesthetic of the items. As is, I enjoyed it, but feel I could have spent my money better elsewhere."

This is a cute and enjoyable experience. It's nice to see the different ways people tackle a common task and something that would normally be a chore is turned into a fun and nearly exciting little game with its fun music and charming art style. For the 3 hours that it lasted, it was definitely interesting to unbox someone's life and perceive a story through their belongings.

However, this game is unfortunately overpriced. While I can always appreciate smaller developers joining the scene, it is also important to know how much an experience is worth. While captivating and intriguing, this game also offers minimal repeatability and does not provide an unforgettable time. The most notable feature of this game is the fact that it is unique, but would otherwise quickly lose it's charm the more that it is explored; especially as a genre.

I do recommend this game as it can be very fun for a marginally definite group of people, but for myself do I not believe it to be worth the amount I paid or the experience it provided. That being said, cool game!"

While the complaints of the game being rather short for the price do have some merit (taking my time to unpack each level and getting all of the achievements took a little under 4 hours), I still wouldn't trade this experience for the world. As advertised, this is a very zen puzzle game that has just enough 'puzzle' to keep it interesting while being more than 'zen' enough to make it a non-frustrating experience. While I very much enjoyed the gameplay aspect - the feeling of everything getting put in its place is just absolutely amazing beyond description - as well as the fantastically relaxing soundtrack, I was surprised by how much the storytelling aspect actually blew me away. Just all in all an absolutely fantastic experience, with a soft and sweet ending that genuinely made me cry, and I will undoubtedly be booting this up in the future to find new ways to unpack the rooms and relax in the future."

First and foremost... I think you may need a box of tissues - maybe. I certainly bawled my eyes out, maybe because it was in a way daunting at times thinking of actually being the person cramming yourself into someone else's tiny living space you now share... and then moving on... I cried hardest at the end, like a relieved, happy cry. It's so good. I am not normally one to write reviews but I think it's especially important for a tinier game like this.
You'll probably spend a few hours in this and maybe see some new things in someone's house you don't recognise, running from room to room trying to figure out ""why the hell did that go on top of the fridge?"". You won't mind, though. Please give this game a chance. It's ""environmental storytelling"" at a level you can interact with and be a part of. Lots of little fun things to look at and see what comes along each time.

On one hand the story the game tells through subtext feels sweet and complete. But on the other hand I can't say that I wouldn't love to see more content for a game like this. I could honestly probably play so many more hours if this game was expanded.

For example - it would've been wonderful to see the devs tell other people's stories too - with new locations, storage challenges, new items to unbox for the different personalities, hobbies, and styles - plus some new achievement stickers to go with it. For some reason - the idea of designing your own space and curating your own clothes and items also sounds like a hypothetically appealing addition to this game. But at the same time that kind of just sounds like I'm describing The Sims 4 Build & Buy mode - so maybe scratch that last idea.

It's just so satisfying, the devs have really itched a part of my psyche with this game, I don't know why but moving these 2D pixel art objects around a room is so calming. So I can't help but feel a bit disappointed that there won't be any new content for this wonderful game. But I still enjoyed the experience of playing it, and will no doubt play it again and again.

I've begun to feel like there could be a tiny little hole in the market for another game to come a long and create a similar experience that is more expansive. But even if that does happen, there will always be something special about Unpacking for me - it's charm is unforgettable imo.

While I personally would say it was worth the $20 I spent on it, some may not feel the same way - especially if there isn't as much replay-ability for them as there is for me. Cause the initial play through is rather short after all. So if your unsure I'd say wait till it's on sale."

There is zero replayability with this game and you finish in just a few hours, which makes me realize it's not worth the $20. If there were frequent updates with new rooms or content, it might be worth the cost."

I have not finished the game yet, but I was rooting for this young girl to get confident in her art.
As I was progressing through the years, seeing the place for her diploma being under her bed, having no desk to work or no real space for her really live killed me. I'm in 2015 now, you go girl, you're doing great, you got this. Your diploma is where is has to be, right on the wall, I'm glad it's there for people to see that you worked hard.

I know it's a game, but art is something that is often considered as a hobby and not a work, when you look at a piece of art for 3 seconds before going to the next, you don't see the hours poured in the piece, even less the years of work for this art to even exist.
Don't speak to an artist telling them they are gifted, like one day, they got ""art"" as superpower. They worked really hard for you to see that picture, read that book, watch that short, etc. Art is a work and deserve as much consideration as any other.

So for those who read this, I'm going to give you a challenge. When you'll have a look at a picture, don't scroll down quickly, give it at least 10 seconds and a like. If you're crazy, even share the art and make a comment. Those are what fuel the artists in confidence, this is what anybody practicing art needs along a huge cup of coffee.

Here is an addition I forgot to make explaining why I have such a long playing time on that game : I made a clue guide, not a walkthrough, a guide giving you clues to find what to do by yourself.

I love this game, it's very relaxing and fun. Although my issue is that it is very overpriced, im sorry but 30$ for this? The game play doesn't last long, and the game finishes fast. Sure you can do it again, but it's gonna be the same game play over and over. That can become repetitive and boring, I would spend my money on something more worth it.

This is such a nice little indie game, but seriously why such an expensive price tag? I got it 30% off (cheapest sale to date), and got only 5 hours of play time taking my sweet, sweet time. Game is honestly perfect at what it's trying to do and the environmental storytelling is cute, but jeez it's hard to justify such a steep price for such a short game.

Oh well, it at least was fun to play the ideal millennial fantasy of owning a home and being in a loving relationship."

This game is the masterclass of environmental storytelling. No I'm not kidding.

The game is very relaxing, but it's extremely overpriced.

I have bought this game on sale, because I have heard how relaxing that game is and I thought with my anxiety disorder it might be a good idea to try it out. And in fact it did help me relax and it was fun to unpack the belongings of the person whose life you are following, to learn a bit about their life and story from childhood all the way into adulthood.
However I have finished this game in only a bit over 3 hours, where I did rather often not pay attention to the game due to having to leave my computer for a bit, and for a game that on sale still had cost me 12€ and has absolutely no replayability whatsoever, I genuinely feel like I have wasted my money a bit. I have paid less for games that had more gameplay to offer.

But the price aside, the game itself is very nice. As mentioned it is incredibly relaxing in my personal opinion, with some nice music and very pretty visuals. In general the art style is really sweet and the story you get to see is very heartfelt. Also you can place everything almost everywhere that you want, which makes it interesting to see the way other people unpacked everything.

So all in all, I can certainly recommend the game if you are after something very relaxing and super sweet. But simply not at that price, even when on sale."

Unpacking is a charming, relaxing puzzle game.
Each level has the same goal, in a different location, you just moved in, and need to unpack and place your stuff. There is no time limit, just a homey soundtrack and the sounds of opening boxes and placing your items.
The puzzle aspect comes into play once you placed everything. The game wants certain items in certain places to complete a level. But this can also be disabled in the option, so you can place everything where you feel it’s best suited.
Through the different locations, which are separated by a couple of years each, and the items you unpack, Unpacking tries to tell its story and makes you think about what is happening in the life of the person you unpack the boxes for.
A perfect game, for when you just want to relax and calm down a for a bit :)"

This game is vastly overpriced for what it is. That being said the content is cute. But you're play time is maybe an hour; two hours max. 4-8 hours is a gross overestimation.

I am super loving this game.
Already hooked, and am on the 4th level so far.
I love the cute pixel aesthetic, and it feels really calming to just choose where you want to place things, and in the end design the room the way you want it.
Only issue so far is some items are confusing where they can go; on the third level I couldn't hang my towel up in the Bathroom on an empty towel rack with the others, and instead had to place it in my wardrobe?? Same with my apron that I also put in the wardrobe instead of the Kitchen.
Played this while taking a break from studying for end of year exams, and it's super relaxing to play. Looking forward to playing this more after I finish them!
In the end, what the Devs have made here is a super fantastic and fun game, and I can't wait to see how well this game does in the future. Glad that my fellow Australians are in the limelight from this one."

I bought this game when it was on sale and it's a cute game with a charming story. It's relaxing to play, sorting items and building a home while watching someone's life play out but the game is EXTREMELY short. There's only so many different places the game lets you put items, so the replay value is limited and I believe 20$ is FAR to much to be asking for a game like this. I completed the entire game (100% completion with all achievements) in less than 4.5 hours. If you really want to play this game I would recommend buying it while it's on sale.

Not a bad game overall, but overpriced for how little game there actually is."

Unpacking one’s belongings after moving to a new place could be a stressful operation, but it could also be a zen-like, nostalgic moment: you see your life condensed in a box, you reminisce upon the memories that each item brings up and you assign a new home on a shelf or in a drawer for each of these memory shards. Unpacking manages to capture these feelings perfectly, conveying a relaxing and evocative experience, and delivering a subtle and emotional story that is told solely through its gameplay and environment, without words.

Unpacking 
A Screenshot of Unpacking
By: 🍒 Lilly (🌸◠‿◠)

Each of the 8 levels in Unpacking represents a different stage in life and different living quarters to decorate. They spawn over a period of 21 years, starting from early childhood when the faceless protagonist first received her own room and ending in adulthood as a fully accomplished woman. As you pull the items one by one out of the boxes that are stacked in every room and find places for each of them, her life slowly unravels before your eyes: an ever growing collection of stuffed toys, a framed diploma here, an award later, some profession-related items that suggest an artistic career, or others that indicate the relationship status in that specific period of her life etc.

Apart from some specific cases, the objects are not interactive, and clicking them also doesn’t produce any text prompts but they subtly convey what happened in the time period between two sequential levels. I would normally think that reading a few carefully chosen words reflecting the thoughts triggered by picking up a certain item would be an enhancement to the gameplay, yet in it's vastly more satisfying to discover all the little details by yourself, and to assemble the whole picture from these pieces of information, like a jigsaw puzzle.


To some degree, the items have determined places or particular types of locations and after all the items are placed down, the ones with an incorrect positioning are highlighted with a red border. Rearranging things so that they fit in the spaces allocated is part of the gameplay and it also brings more realism to the game. For example, you don't know beforehand how many clothing objects you'll have to place in the wardrobe and how many available hangers there are, or how many books a certain collection has, therefore in the end you'll likely need to move some of the items around. For those that prefer more flexibility, the strict positioning of the items can be turned off from the option menu yet this diminishes the puzzle aspect of the game.

Aside from the obviously gorgeous pixel graphics and the chill, tranquil gameplay, the feature I liked the most in the game was the ability to watch a replay of a level at high speed, with all the movements I made while solving it. Additionally, this can then be exported into a gif or a video.


is not only a very relaxing game, but also a wholesome one and overall an extremely satisfying experience, especially for people like me, who enjoy living in an orderly environment. My only complaint about the game is that the asking price of $20 is too high for the 3-4h of fun that it offers - it would be great if more levels are added in the future and included in the same price, yet at the moment there’s no information about that. It does have some replayability value if you reset the levels, although replaying them does not bring anything new to the game. features Steam-integrated achievements, the majority of which are awarded for doing things a bit differently than what you’d expect, yet still extremely trivial to obtain (by placing some of the objects in some peculiar locations)."

I did enjoy this game very much and found joy in the little details as well as the soothing music. But 20 Euros is too much for about 3 hours of gameplay. Yes, the rewind and GIF feature are cute, but nobody really uses it. I am hoping that the devs update the game with more content or and endless modus. Because otherwise I really can't recommend this game to anyone for this price."

Yes, it costs 20 moneys and there are games that will run you for a lot longer than Unpacking for that price. But do those games let you organize underwear by colour? Do they let you organize books by size? Do they let you put all your man's clothes under the bed while you take over his wardrobe? ♥♥♥♥ up his colour coded kitchen with your ugly appliances? I don't think so. If this game isn't for you, it's just not for you, go spend those 20 moneys on an anime girl on a gacha or something. This game is for ME.

tldr: I really liked this game, recommend."

The game that proves unpacking can be a moving experience.

So what’s there to do in Unpacking? Unpack. Simple as that. Each level tasks the player with taking a series of boxes and emptying their contents, positioning them one-by-one in appropriate places around each room. These tasks start out simple, with the player needing to unpack only an individual room, and slowly progress into larger areas spanning an entire household. This is simple and flawless gameplay at its finest, one that developer self-describes as “zen block-fitting puzzle”. But it’s so much more than that.

The key gameplay concept of Unpacking is one that is innately human: moving house. Each room is initially bare, devoid of any sort of homeliness. Piece by piece, the player removes an item at a time from each box and can position them in any spot around each room. Although it might be entertaining to put a stuffed toy on the toilet (toylet?) or hide a Gameboy under your pillow, every item has its appropriate place to call home. During the level you’ll be given the freedom to place items wherever you wish, but upon unpacking all the items the player may be prompted that some don’t quite align with the room’s aesthetic. So you’d better put that toilet roll where it belongs, and make sure to move all those dirty cups out of your bedroom while you’re at it.

Zen is exactly the perfect descriptor for this style of gameplay. There is no time limit, no pressure, and really very little element of stress or challenge. Players may proceed at their own pace, taking time to appreciate their surroundings, slotting each new item into their new home. This slow-paced gameplay becomes especially important when admiring the game’s stunning visuals, which hold an impressive amount of detail and are full of clever references and nods to pop culture.

Story

Taking a back seat in Unpacking, much of the story is left up to the interpretation of the player. Cleverly presented across a series of levels, the player experiences a lifetime of unpacking from childhood bedrooms through to independent adulthood. Each stage begins with the year in which it is occurs, setting the scene for the gameplay that follows. Once completed, a photograph of the completed room is taken and lovingly stuck into to a photo album with a short comment explaining the situation.

Although the presentation of Unpacking’s story is done in such a minimalist style, Witch Beam manage to expertly convey a convincing sense of raw human emotion. I can’t go into significant detail in discussing the story that unfolds, but there are moments where this game will make you feel deep sadness, conflicting regret, and an overwhelming sense of joy. There are many elements of the game that I’m sure that players will be able to relate to their own experiences of moving house, as there are many themes that resonate with what it means to be human.

Visuals

Realism and pixel art harmoniously unite in Unpacking, which offers a detailed and vibrant pixel art aesthetic that is among some of the best to date. Don’t expect the blocky 8-bit or 16-bit pixel art that many other indie games lean towards; this is pixel art that imitates real life. From the designs of houses and rooms all the way down to its smallest contents, the visuals of Unpacking are not only highly-detailed and realistic, but carry an underlying charm to every item that is delicately moved out of its box.

If you consider yourself a geek, the art in Unpacking will appeal to you on so many levels. Rooms are crammed with electronics, Monster Manuals, lovingly-crafted miniatures, and even half-finished cosplay outfits that adorn mannequins. Throughout every minute of gameplay I found myself needing to stop and admire the intricate details, like deliberately-crafted videogame consoles, game and DVD cases that perfectly capture real-life cover art, adorable sets of plush toys, and even the beauty of the simplest day-to-day items like toiletries and stationary. Items may even change as they are brought along to several locations, becoming worn or weathered over time like an old mouse pad or a treasured stuffed toy.

Audio

Pixel art calls for chiptunes, but just like Unpacking’s incorporation of realism in its visuals, so too does it add real life to its music through the use of many instruments. The core foundation of the soundtrack is a chill synth with chiptunes to carry the melody, harmoniously interwoven with a mix of acoustic guitar, funky bass, and even some solemn piano for the game’s more poignant moments. Gorgeous tunes from Canadian-Australian composer, Jeff Van Dyck, set the mood for the rest of the game.

But it’s not just the music of Unpacking that will delight your eardrums, there are minute details throughout to impress any audiophile. For example, picking up and placing every single item in the game is accompanied by a unique sound effect depending on the object and surface on which it is placed. There’s a great degree of detail to the sound design – even to the point of hearing game discs rattle in their case when placed on a shelf, or the satisfying thud of a book laid face down. Environmental cues too remind you clearly that the game is taking place in subtropical Australia, with background chattering of Rainbow Lorrikeets and whistling of Honey Eaters while leaves calmly rustle in the wind. So satisfying.

Extras

Outside of the main game, which will take approximately 4 hours to complete, the game has some extra content to keep players coming back for more. Each level has some hidden secrets when placing an item in a peculiar or perfect spot – doing so will reward the player with a sticker and an achievement. These stickers can be used in the game’s photo mode, where the player is given access to all sorts of filters and adjustments to showcase that game’s beautiful art. I spent quite a bit of time in the photo mode, which can produce some pictures that are truly wallpaper-worthy.

Conclusion

There are few games I’ve played that I can say are truly beautiful, heart-warming and touching, but Unpacking is all that and so much more. Such a simple gameplay concept not only manages in itself to be incredibly entertaining and strangely satisfying, but when combined with detailed pixel art and themes of human emotion, manages to become almost poetic. Even the simplest moments of the game have the ability overwhelm the player with joy and happiness. This gameplay is one that could have great impact – I’d personally love to see it applied to different situations, like those less fortunate who have been driven out of home for reasons beyond their control.

Witch Beam have created a game unlike any other I’ve played, and if you are a human with a heart, I implore you to experience it as well. Unpacking truly is a moving game in every sense of the word.

So, why should you play it?
- Simple, elegant, and satisfying gameplay.
- Stunning and detailed pixel art.
- Plenty of clever pop-culture references.
- Deeply emotional story despite minimal dialogue.
- Impressive attention-to-detail through audio design.

But why shouldn’t you play it?
- Players looking for a lengthy experience may be dissatisfied.
- You’ve only ever lived in one place and have never had to unpack.

Absolutely lovely style and game play is cute. I did really feel like I got to know the character. However, the reason I cannot recommend this game is because it lasted only 3 hours! That's easily one of the shortest games I've ever played, especially for this price! I bought it on sale and it's still crazy expensive for what you get. I hope eventually there might be updates and more stories but as the game is now, I cannot recommend it."

Cute art and story, however, I finished it in under 3 hours. Which for me is NOT worth $20. If it were a mediocre game I'd pay $4.99, but since it's cute I'd still say they're charging double what it's worth. Feels like a robbery honestly. Especially considering there are a couple levels with only one or two rooms, out of I believe 7 levels. I wouldn't buy it unless its on sale or you have money to throw away."

Ignore playtime. I played it in offline mode.

Many will scoff at the $20 price tag but I can see the love and devotion put in the game. Sound design and pixel design isn't easy, even in this day and age. The developers put in a crazy amount of sound effects so that putting items in various areas spots makes a different sound. I would certainly hope the $20 contributes to paying the developers, sound artists, and graphic artists a a good wage for their effort in this.

The game is charming and relaxing. The only complaint that I have about the game is that it's short. I certainly would love to see more, as in a different story with different items or something similar to that. The game can be a little finicky when it comes to the placement of different items but it's not hard to figure it out where it needs to go. But sometimes it can feel like it's a bit of a puzzle game to ensure that you're arranging things properly so that everything has its place.

If you're a stickler for organization, there's certainly a chance that you're playing the game a lot longer than average, but it will certainly tickle your categorizing/organizing fancy.

If you enjoy incredible pixel art, this game is for you.
If you're looking for something relaxing and laid back, this game is for you.
If you like organizing and arranging, this game is for you.

To me, it's worth the price. Especially if it means that there's an opportunity for more of this game or a sequel or something. I just want more of this!

All in all 8.5/10"

I love the concept, and most of the game play is reasonably enjoyable. What super ruined it for me though is how certain items need to be placed in very specific rooms or places in rooms..

That journal? No, you can't place it on the shelf or desktop, it must go IN THE DRAWER.
That small trashcan? No, that can't go in the bathroom, that's supposed to be in the bedroom..
That game/movie case? No, you can't put that on the coffee table, that needs to go on the shelf!
That laundry basket? No, you need to move it ONE SPACE CLOSER TO THE LAUNDRY ROOM CLOSET THING.

As soon as I realized the game was gonna tell me where certain things had to go and I wasn't really quite as free to place things how I wanted, the rest of the levels became a slog to quickly place things wherever they were probably wanted to I could get the little ""this needs to be placed somewhere else"" outline so I could finish the level."

Very pretty pixel art, but not worth the price asked for. Barely three hours of content and very restrictive, you can't actually decorate the levels the way you'd like, every item has a specific place and the game won't let you finish till you put things where they're supposed to be."

There should be a competing title in this genre so that EA won't keep cashing in on this community which has been more and more lenient and tried its best to put up with whatever bs dlc the devs have put together. It's a shame that this franchise has fallen so far.
Pros:
-Bunch of really nice quality of life features compared to the previous titles
Con:
-The game feels soulless and cutting corners at every possible opportunity to do so.
-DLC price tag unjustified unlike the previous titles
-Terrible and baffling game design decisions everywhere, they're some of the most cored features too
-Action queue is extremely buggy years after the game's release, the amount of time for a sim to perform action/idling is nonsensical.
-Removed sandbox design and put in the older scene/lot system is such a backwards compromise that's almost certainly done for technical/engine limits reason, such a shame to see so much game design potential being thrown into the trash because they chose the easy way out.(As expected, the decision here came back to bite them when they design some of the dlc content, which feels really disrupted by the constant fast travelling"

I love The Sims. I love The Sims 4. Here's why I don't recommend it.

-Still launches through Origin. Buying on Steam just adds another layer of DRM.
-If you previously purchased through Origin, you will need to redownload any DLC, even if you already had it installed
-Your DLC carries over, the base game does not, which means you'll have to purchase the base game again.
-Your DLC doesn't 'unlock' through Steam's store, if you purchased it on Origin (because of course it doesn't)

This is probably the worst Steam integration I've ever seen. Don't buy it here if you already own it, just use ""add non-Steam game to library"". It's almost identical and $20 cheaper."

TLDR: DO NOT BUY BASE SIMS 4!! Buy it HEAVILY DISCOUNTED bundled with one of the major expansions (Seasons or Pets), and MOD THE ♥♥♥♥ OUT OF IT!!


Base Sims 4 is nearly unplayable due to the lack of content, repetitive and easily manipulative emotions system, and an overall feeling of restriction. Which is damaging in a game series that is designed around player freedom. There are also so many irritating qualities to it that make it seem like it wasn't fine tweaked enough. Why is every single Sim such a social butterfly that I cannot get them to stop talking to each other for five seconds? Why do they take so long to eat? Why are the lots so small and so empty? Why is nearly nothing from Sims 3, and heck, even Sims 2 brought over?? (Horses, Cars, pools, restaurants, grocery stores, fun recreational activities, ect.)

With that being said, there is some classic Sim Fun to be had with this game, if you are able to get it for a heavily discounted price and get it bundled with one of the major expansions (I would recommend either Pets or Seasons). I would also highly recommend downloading a plethora of Mods, because they fix a vast majority of the systems in base Sims 4 that make it more enjoyable. If Mods are not your thing, then I would think twice about purchasing this game. **This is one of the easiest games to Mod fyi**

Mod Recommendations (Like seriously, don't even play base Sims 4 before downloading these Mods)

Sims 4 Mod Manager by Raxdiam (Not necessary, but a very convenient and easy way to keep track of your mods. Very user friendly, will do 100% of the work for you)

Meaningful Stories by roBurky (A mod pack that effectively revamps the mood and emotions systems of Sims 4. This makes the systems feel waaay more fleshed out and realistic, and significantly less manipulatable)

Better Romance by simler90 (Adds more rules and checks into how Sims romance one another. In base Sims 4, you are basically always guaranteed to succeed in romance. There is quite literally no way to fail. This Mod expands heavily upon it, making it so that the traits Sims have will impact whether or not they will accept any advances.)

Wonderful Whims by TURBODRIVER (Goes great with Better Romance with no compatibility issues that I'm aware of. Adds in an Attractiveness system, first Impressions, Personality Archetypes, and even a Menstrual Cycle and Birth Control system. With this, you are more equipped to design your Sims overall sexuality and sexual lives. Hugely rewarding, and designed perfectly that it will seem like it is a natural part of the game.)

There is also a ♥♥♥♥ load of CC (Custom Content) out there like clothes, hair, buildings, Sims, ect. ""Mod The Sims"" is the best place to find all of this. Don't spend money on any of the Stuff Packs, because most of that stuff included in them you'll find for free made by someone online. Usually looks nicer too."

My Gf loves and plays this game a lot. but i have noticed The whole DLC packages for the game is total rip off. I understand maybe buying a pass for x of dlc but the fact you have to pay for each one is an actual joke. making them spend £18 plus to be a werewolf, Vampire or to just have a Pet. They even charge for seasons like snow etc. It's EA so makes sense, This game is the literal embodiment of slicing up the game and selling the pieces back to consumers. Or a 1000 piece jigsaw but charging you after 10 pieces have been put together. They don't even give loyal or franchise veterans anything for free. If you're rich or don't intend on buying loads of DLC maybe buy this game. Fans should take a stand and boycott the franchise to stop their greed until they remove this awful scheme of extracting money from fans. I hope sims fans get an apology but also more of making sure fans actually get the content they pay for when they buy the game."

The base game has about $5 worth of content. Why? Because EA do what EA does, it cost around $2000 cad to get the full game. I wish I was kidding. The DLC cost just that much and they put so little into the base game so in order to enjoy the game you have to buy the DLC. Why do people support this crap? How is this legal?

Before this review, I feel like it's important to say that I have more than 23.7 hours in this game. A LOT more. I've got that much alone on PS4, and 500+ hours on my original origin account, which I can sadly no longer access to check the exact number. I got this game 9 years ago, full price retail, and have played it on and off since the age of 9. I've played this game to death over the years, and that's why it hurts me to leave a negative review. You can still have fun with it, and I will explain that, but it's flaws are just too plentiful for me to leave a positive review.

It would be easy to say that this game used to be great, but that... would be a blatant lie. The game was barren when it released. Key features from past games were missing, like toddlers and POOLS. How were we supposed to kill our sims now? Give them a long and happy life until a natural death? Hardly! Along with that, the map screens didn't even have colour; they were pure white, sterile places. Maybe it was supposed to be stylistic, but... I can't help but think about how much cheaper it must have been.

Slowly, over the years, we started to get more DLC packs of various tiers. It didn't start out too egregious, I wouldn't say. Sure, Luxury Party Stuff was lacklustre, but we had things like Outdoor Retreat to keep us going! Though, it was hard not to note how quickly EA had jumped to make DLC whilst the core game was missing such basic features. That isn't even to say how the community at large took the closed-world and lack of colour and pattern customisation. I'll tell you how they took it; badly. They took it badly.

With all this DLC, there was a problem.

IT. DIDN'T. STOP.

Now, it's normal for a Sims game to have a large amount of DLC. But this? It became staggering. As of this review, all of the DLC for this game will run you over $800.

OVER. EIGHT. HUNDRED. DOLLARS.

I'll let that sink in.

Have you ever wondered how this game is free? That's how. It's not like this DLC is truly optional. Some of it is, sure! But would you like your life simulator to have weather? A normal amount of clothes? More than THREE PLACES TO LIVE, ONE OF THEM BEING AN EMPTY FIELD? Then you'd best pony up! It's hard to fully express how empty this game feels without DLC. And EA knows it feels that empty, and that they can keep milking us for every last cent.

At this point, you may have noticed something, or you may have not. And that's the fact that I said I've been playing this game for nine years. And that means the game has been out for nine years now. Since 2014. This game is almost a decade old. This is an issue. A big issue. When this game first released, it prided itself on it's intelligent autonomous sims. They can multitask; like watching television AND eating at the same time! Wowzers! But with this much time having passed, you'd be hard pressed to find somebody confident to call these sims anything above 'serviceable, I guess'. Your sims will wash their plates in the bathroom! Your sims will grab water if you leave them alone for two seconds and drink until they experience bladder failure! Your sims will start a fight with their spouse, seemingly just for kicks! Your sims will stop moving until you reset them with a cheat code! Your sims will be left with an undeletable action in their queue until you, again, use a cheat code! You get the picture. This game is a mess, with problems that could be wiped clean in a theoretical Sims 5. So why don't they?

Because EA have created a live-service single-player game, and they'd be stupid to give it up.

This live-service model, piling DLC upon DLC onto the game? It's managed to cause even more issues than the game had to begin with. Each new download comes with new bugs unique in nature. Oops, there go your textures! Oops, your sims are now all autonomously screaming at each other! Oops, your Sims are BUILDING ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEIR OWN CHILDREN! These are the kinds of things you'll have to get used to, and this only gets worse each time they add DLC. There are problems in this game that have become support beams by this point; fix those bugs, and everything will fall apart. So they just... don't! The Sims 4 is fundamentally broken, and they won't throw the game out and start fresh, because the horse they're beating still isn't dead. Just bleeding and shambling.

This greed helped lead to the point we've reached today. Even with the uproar against My First Pet Stuff (A DLC for a DLC), it seemed enough people were content to buy such a tiny stuff pack because we got a whole new category for things just like it.

Kits. Dear lord, kits. These things aren't popular with the community, and it's clear to see why. Such meagre amounts of items might seem doable at $5 a pop, but they're adding up, and quick. Filled with lacklustre designs that only work well as a base for custom content, they're the peak of EA's lazy contributions to this game.

I mentioned custom content, so I suppose that's a horse out the stable now. Yeah, custom content is amazing. And that's because EA has no hand in it. Well, I should give them a little credit; the native mod support is an honestly nice touch! There's your first positive, EA.

Custom content is a general term for items created by the community. Clothes, furniture, accessories, you name it! With multiple dedicated sites to download it, and fan made tools that make creation easy, it's great! And by easy, I mean easy. I was making Pokemon shirts for my games at age 12. Just takes a little research. All these items come in two main styles; one more realistic (Alpha) and one to match the game's items (Maxis Match). Build up a good folder filled with gigabytes of fashion and get to work living your life in Create-A-Sim; don't forgot to buy a new SD card to fit it all in. You'll need it.

It's not just custom content that the community makes. There's also good old fashioned script mods. These have all sorts of functions; they can fix some in-game issues, add entirely new game mechanics, give you features that you always wanted (controllable pets comes to mind), and more. (More including the... infamous Wicked Whims and Extreme Violence mods. Ah, timeless classics). All these mods help breathe new life into the game and show how passionate this community can be, no matter how downtrodden by the source material.

These mods help to show how this game is actually fun at it's core. You might have read all this ragging and be baffled by my heel-turn, but it's true. Why else would I have put in all those hours? That core gameplay loop of letting your sims lead their lives is damn fun, and I can't help but enjoy it; even with everything EA is doing.

I think that others could enjoy it too if they started playing today. There is something here, at the heart of it. It's just coated in a decade of bloat and greed.

(This segment is a replacement for an old one that caused me issues, that I'm removing to keep this review safe. I think you can tell by the comments below and the tone of this review what that was, and you can take that as you wish.)

Anyway, EA can do one, and you should give Sims 4 a chance, if you like. There's good here, but this game reeks of greed and jank at it's core."
the+sims+4,Not Recommended,397.1,"Posted: June 9, 2022
This is my favorite game that I can't recommend. I love this game, as my playtime will tell, and I will continue to pour more hours into this game. I'm not giving a negative review because of the game's ""fun factor."" It's very destressing, it's chill, its difficulty is all in the hands of the players. The modding scene is great, and the creative possibilities are infinite. On paper, the Sims 4 seems like the dream game. A perfect game that even people who have literally never touched a game before in their life can pick up and play. In reality, EA has erected a massive series of walls that you have to scale to reach that state, and this is the crux of the review. The ultimate problem is, and is the whole reason I'm giving this a negative review, is recommending people to buy this game because of the aforementioned walls. To say that they have become untenable is an understatement. They are nigh insurmountable at this point.

The first wall, and this is the point where most people stop at, is the pricing. It being free-to-play as of October 18th does not save this from being HORRIDLY expensive through DLC cost. The base Sims 4 with no expansions or packs, makes the game EXTREMELY limited in scope as to what you can do. Want to be a spellcaster? Want to attend university? Have cats or dogs? Have changing seasons in the weather? Form clubs? Get famous? Have a job? That's ALL locked behind DLC that is either the same price as the base game, or, get this, DOUBLE the price of the base game. All those things I listed? Those are SEPARATE DLCs! If you were to not get them on sale, it would run you a couple HUNDRED already! And this just getting started. On the store page, as I'm typing this right now, it lists 56 different DLC, and to buy them all in one fell swoop costs just short of a THOUSAND dollars. Nobody in their right mind should make that investment, and I can't be of the mind to tell someone to spend that much on a single game.

Now, to play Devil's Advocate for a moment, this is only as bad if you buy it when it isn't on sale, which the game goes on quite frequently. Deep sales, in fact! Up to 75% a lot of things, which bring down the price for everything by a couple hundred dollars. In fact, with the Summer Sale that's coming up as of the time of writing this review, this game will most likely get significant price slashes. However, to counter that point, the asking price is still SEVERAL HUNDRED DOLLARS. The prices become more manageable, but it is still a SIGNIFICANT investment. More of an investment than, frankly, I think this game deserves. And considering how Sims 3 with everything still costs such an outrageous amount, it would seem that those prices aren't going anywhere for the time being.

If a high asking price was all that kept people away, I suppose you could argue the point that not recommending a game you like because of pricing is silly. That if you put hundreds of hours in like I have, the price is ""worth it."" Perhaps that argument would have grounds and I would entertain it, if not for the fact that the game in of itself just fundamentally DOES NOT WORK with everything combined. These are the other walls, and this can become overwhelming for the inexperienced. Even if you buy everything and you jump in, the Sims 4 is a strange program that seemingly randomly decides to brick itself every so often, without you even really being the cause of it. There are so many bugs and glitches that have no fixes for it, merely ways to temporarily relieve of you of it, much like ibuprofen for a headache. And they aren't the silly, funny glitches seen in Skyrim.

For example, randomly, the game will begin to run under 30 frames after exiting build mode, and you solve it by merely pausing the game and unpausing it. Not a terrible bug but it's pretty much the epitome of the problems I have with this game: everything is just player made solutions rather than an official bug fix. It will happen again, and instead of just fixing it, EA just tells you what you can do to help yourself with it. You'll be doing this often, spending hours looking up some obscure error, through no fault of your own, because either Sims 4 randomly decides to brick your Resources.cfg after update and makes it impossible for you to play with CC of any kinds, or your anti virus somehow marks this entire game as potential ransomware, or the Sims 4 randomly just corrupt your save file and you're trying to figure out how to fix that. And that's just on the meta side of everything.

File headaches aside, the game itself just acts wonky as well, adding its own walls to scale. A cursory glance at the reviews for the DLCs illustrate the absolute nightmares that spawn with these additions, but I'll share some of the errors I've had on my end. I've had multiple instances where I tell a Sim to fulfill their hygiene need and their immediate first instinct is to...run out and clean a solar panel? In place of just taking a shower in one of the MULTIPLE showers that exist in that house? I tell them to fulfill their energy need, thinking they'll go to bed, and they'll either randomly decide to back float in the pool, or drink an incredibly irresponsible amount of coffee, like a third shift worker going off of only three hours of sleep. Fixed all of this by manually telling them what to do. I've also had moments where I couldn't wash laundry because the game bugged out my washer and dryer, where the prompts for washing never came up. Only the prompts for putting the dirty laundry in and taking the dirty laundry out. Fixed by selling the set and then buying another. I've also had my weather permanently glitch itself into never changing at all. Where it snows all through winter and all through spring, causing me to have to buy a weather changing device in game and use it. Sims will randomly drop whatever they are doing to do some unrelated task, such as stop cooking to randomly mold some hunk of clay sitting in some corner of the room. Sometimes, my Sims will also stand still with the ""chat with (sim)"" action in the queue, but then never actually chat with that person,, for whatever reason, causing them to bug ouit and need them to be reset. The list goes on and on, and I think you've gotten the point already.

Again, these are fixed by just manually selecting actions, using console commands, and removing the bugged items in question. I know what you're thinking. Why are you complaining about bugs that have an in game solution? The issue is, again, that this is just player solutions for problems that aren't being fixed. You're paying hundreds of dollars for this game and the DLC. You'd expect a level of polish to behind this, but there isn't. Players shouldn't have to actively fight against a game they bought, only to find a bunch of band-aid, player made solutions a because the FEATURES IN GAME THEY PAID HUNDREDS FOR DOESN'T WORK AND EA DOESN'T DO ANYTHING TO FIX THEM.

It's all the same hackneyed excuse of ""there being so much in this game"" and sounding like they are some small game dev studio. All of this frustration after the ludicrous pay wall is just simply unforgivable, and to recommend people this game knowing the hours worth of troubleshooting and fixing I've had to do is like to encourage self destructive tendencies. I made the investment, I bought the steam edition to make a review. I sunk a lot both in time and money, and have got to a point where I can say I enjoy this game, perhaps through Sunken Cost reasoning and Stockholm Syndrome. But it required me having to scale multiple walls and slaying multiple beasts to get there, and that's just simply not a journey for everyone. I cannot look at someone and genuinely tell them to make the same investments I have, nor do I think EA should benefit from having people do so.

Edit: Also having Origin become a MANDATORY download that has to get loaded EACH time sucks.

Edit 2: Sims 4 is now free to play, but my thumbs down remains."

After coming from The Sims 3, I was severely disappointed. Setting aside all of the EAisms about the game (obscenely expensive expansions to get basic game play features that should be in the base game, over inclusion of social media aspects, etc.) I was expecting a phenomenal experience. Instead, they seem to have limited the ability to travel, removing the semi-open world of TS3 and instead reverting back to a very old school system of traveling to what basically amounts to a few city blocks, which was the most disappointing feature. You can no longer have your sims travel to work in a real environment, instead they do the ole disappearing act and reappear after 8 hours. No more travelling to a grocery store, all supplies are magically bought and created out of thin air. I felt like I was playing TS1 or 2 again, and everything feels very stripped down and bare-bones, very much like a mobile game.

To be fair, they have added a much more in depth sim creator, which is pretty cool if that's all you care about. The AI system seems to work better too with interactions between sims being more fluid and natural.

Overall, disappointed. Wouldn't recommend."

I am saying this for the people that ALREADY have this on ORIGIN
From all that I've seen. Despite me having the base game on Steam, and buying the DLCs from my previous experiences with Origin... IT DOESN'T MATTER.
It will say you have the DLCs, but because they aren't on steam you cant USE THEM. EA is really unnecessary with their expensive DLCs that aren't even that good TBH lets be real, 500 bucks for DLC that isn't even better than Sims 3 is kinda upsetting.
But they DONT EVEN LET YOU MOVE YOUR DLCS TO STEAM. EA HAVE PITY ON PEOPLE'S WALLETS PLEASE. THIS IS REALLY MEAN. If you change this later, thank you. Great. But honestly if you don't, no skin off my back. Done buying your stuff. if you already have this game on Origin, STAY THERE."
the+sims+4,Not Recommended,15.2,"Posted: June 19, 2022
I wanna start by saying Sims is always a classic. Each game they make improvements and there is always a level of enjoyment creating a false reality to live in. Even then, though, some key features are taken away for no reason (example color grids for anything rather than just makeup.) This game is just generally a good example of the EA way. Have an iconic well known title, make it only a small portion of the game and lock everything else, hanging the carrot in your face, with Expansion packs galore.
Would I recommend you play this game? Yes. Absolutley, if you have the actual FULL game or just any level of added content besides the base game it
Would i recommend you buy it? Maybe the base game on a steep sale. I'd say the base game by itself is worth maybe 5 bucks and the expansions, although they should be included to begin with, at most 2 dollars per expansion considering there are 56. that's still over 100 dollars.
Castrate me if you want. Pirate this game. EA does not need this money, they are and always have been greedy bastards."
the+sims+4,Not Recommended,0.8,"Posted: March 5, 2021
I went into this game thinking:""Wow I can't wait to see what Maxis and EA has done to improve on the Sims 3!"", only to realize after 40 minutes that there is little to no content that has been carried over from the other titles, and even if their is it's locked behind a 35$ dollar paywall. Oh and don't even try to think about buying all the DLCs because it will cost you 500$ to do so. No game deserves to be 500$. I mean if you're a popular youtuber you could get the DLCs for free?

So if you want a much more watered down almost mobile game level experience then buy this game if not stay the hell away from it. You know what? Just stay away from any EA game, it'll drain your money straight from your pocket. I really do hope when The Sims 5 comes out it's not like this but knowing EA it will be.

Edit: Oh hey, the full game is now 741$ dollars! Isn't that fun? Also to clarify, I had this game on PS4 before I decided to get it on PC, (For mods and other stuff like that), and it ran like ♥♥♥♥ on PS4 as well."

The game is good and enjoyable, however it can be both recommended and not.

The Sims 4"" builds upon the foundations laid by its predecessors, refining the gameplay mechanics and introducing new features that enhance the player's ability to create and control virtual lives. The game allows players to create and control virtual characters, build and furnish homes, and guide their Sims through various life stages and experiences.

Pros and cons
🟩 Positives 🟥 Negatives
- Robust building mechanics and extensive customisation options allow for highly detailed, personalised environments and characters.

- Open-ended approach to storytelling encourages player agency and immersion, fostering a sense of investment and attachment to the Sims and their lives.

- Emotions system adds depth and complexity to Sims' behaviour and interactions, encouraging players to consider their Sims' psychological and emotional well-being.

- User-generated content and modding community expand the game's creative possibilities and offer additional content and features. - Initial lack of content and features compared to previous iterations of the series may lead to frustration and dissatisfaction among players. Reliance on DLC and microtransactions may restrict access to certain content and features for players unwilling or unable to make additional purchases.

- The absence of certain features, such as curved walls or split-level structures, may limit the game's creative potential for some players.

- Monetisation strategies and content-locking practices have raised concerns about the game's accessibility and value for money.

The game retains the core gameplay mechanics of the series, allowing players to create and customise virtual characters, build and furnish homes, and guide their Sims through various life stages and experiences.

Another significant addition is the Emotions system, which adds depth and complexity to the Sims' behaviour and interactions. Sims can now experience a wide range of emotions, such as happiness, sadness, anger, and embarrassment, which are influenced by their environment, social interactions, and personal traits.

A central aspect of the sim's franchise experience is the building mechanics, which allow players to design, construct, and customise their Sims' homes and community lots.

One of the most notable improvements is introducing the room-based building system. This system allows players to create and manipulate individual rooms as modular units, making rearranging and modifying structures easier without requiring extensive reconstruction. This feature streamlines the building process and encourages experimentation. Thus, players can quickly test different layouts and configurations with minimal effort.

Another significant enhancement is the addition of the Build Mode catalogue, which offers a vast array of objects, materials, and decorative items for players to choose from. The catalogue is organised into intuitive categories and features a search function, making it easier for players to find and select the necessary items. This extensive selection of building and furnishing options enables players to create highly detailed and personalised environments that reflect their Sims' personalities, lifestyles, and aspirations.

Moreover, the game's vibrant modding community further enriches the building mechanics, which has produced a wealth of custom content, ranging from unique architectural elements to entire pre-built lots. This user-generated content expands the game's creative possibilities. It allows players to incorporate diverse styles and designs into their creations.

However, the building mechanics in ""The Sims 4"" have limitations. Some players have expressed frustration with the lack of certain features, such as the ability to create curved walls or split-level structures, which were available in previous iterations of the series. Additionally, the game's reliance on DLC and microtransactions mean that access to certain building materials and objects may be restricted for players who do not wish to make additional purchases.

In previous iterations of the series, certain features and content were included in the base game or expansion packs, providing players with a more comprehensive experience without additional purchases. However, ""The Sims 4"" has adopted a more aggressive monetisation strategy, with numerous expansion packs, game packs, and stuff packs that collectively add to a significant financial investment for players wishing to access the full range of content. This has led to concerns about the game's reliance on downloadable content (DLC) and microtransactions, which can be seen as a barrier to entry for players with limited financial resources.

This form of microtransactions has been criticised for several reasons. Firstly, it can be seen as a form of artificial content scarcity. Once part of the core experience, features and content are now gated behind additional purchases. This can lead to frustration and dissatisfaction among players, who may feel that they are being unfairly charged for content that should have been included in the base game.

Secondly, this monetisation strategy raises concerns about the potential normalisation of microtransactions in the gaming industry, as it may encourage other developers and publishers to adopt similar practices. This could shift towards a more fragmented and costly gaming landscape, where players are increasingly expected to pay for additional content to enjoy a complete and fulfilling experience.

It is important to critically evaluate these monetisation strategies and consider their implications for the gaming industry and player experience. While developers and publishers have a legitimate need to generate revenue to sustain their operations and continue producing high-quality games, it is essential to balance financial viability and provide a fair, accessible, and enjoyable experience for players. By supporting more ethical and consumer-friendly monetisation practices, players can help to shape a more sustainable and equitable gaming landscape for all.

""The Sims 4"" offers a unique and engaging virtual life simulation experience, building upon the foundations laid by its predecessors and introducing new features that enhance the player's ability to create and control virtual lives. The game's strengths lie in its emphasis on creativity, self-expression, and storytelling and its efforts to improve accessibility and inclusivity. However, I cannot recommend buying the game due to EA's monetisation strategy, but it is a ""fine"" game."

The Sims 4 is an expensive habit to keep if you are a person, like myself, who feels as if they absolutely must have every available DLC for a game which they enjoy. Without sales or bundling, as of writing this, the entirety of The Sims 4 will cost you a whopping $964.47. I can't say I am surprised, as this is an EA game, but that does not excuse the disgrace that price tag is.

On the other side of that spectrum, people who do not want to purchase any additional content, will more than likely be left dissatisfied with the base game. If you have played any of The Sims 4 predecessors, you will immediately notice that there are aspects ""missing"" from the base game experience that have either not been developed or have been withheld for the purpose of selling expansions/gamepacks/kits.

The more recently released packs have been borderline not play tested before release. If you check the credits for these packs you will notice a stark difference in the number of people developing these and the division of their roles compared to earlier packs. In the end, after a few patches, we do end up with something playable, but many bugs never get fixed.

I do believe it is possible to be satisfied with the game through two routes. Either A. The Sims 4 is your introduction to the franchise so you are unable to compare this title to its predecessors. or B. You curate a healthy mix of additional content alongside CC and mods.

Overall, I would give this game a 7/10 rating, only because of the healthy cc and mod community backing it.

Without any additional content, base game only, my rating drops to a 5/10- absolutely mediocre.

IN SUMMARY: too expensive for a complete experience, predecessors were better for gameplay (TS4 build/buy and character creation is superior imo), incredibly healthy modding community."

I have a long history with the Sims franchise. I started playing The Sims 2 when I was a child because of my mother (and, back in the day, even my grandmother played it). I remember The Sims 3 coming out. I've loved these games ever since I can remember, and they have a very special place in my heart.

Buying this game on Steam was kinda useless, seeing as I already owned it since its release in 2014 on Origin (frankly, I just wanted to see those hours pile up on Steam whenever I get into the cycle of Remember Game Exists > Play Game Obsessively For A Short Period > Forget Game Exists, and I felt a little guilty about my, uhm, less-than-legitimate maritime exploration, to put it in a cute little ~metaphor~, of all of the DLC content over the years).

Now, would I recommend The Sims 4? Honestly, it depends. There are many different kinds of Simmers, and I don't think this is the most adequate for every single one of them.

Lore-wise? Girl, put on an eyepatch and go explore the Sims 2. If you're expecting fleshed out, non-half-assed stories, this will disappoint. (And it has. Why did they do the Caliente sisters this dirty? Why? I just wanna know...)

Building-wise? 100% MADE FOR YOU, BUY IT. I have never considered myself a builder, ever, but this game... Oh, man, it really boosts my self-esteem, not gonna lie. Whenever I make house I'm really proud of, I showcase it to every one. It's great! I think everyone can agree that this game has the best Build-and-Buy Mode that the Sims franchise has ever seen.

CAS-wise? Hmmmm, this one is tricky. Creating Sims is so fun, it's true, but without Custom Content? It's a no-go for me, thank you very much. I've recently discovered that a lot of people find the Sims 3 sims ugly, and that was honestly a HUGE surprise to me, because although the sims in The Sims 4 are much more aesthetically pleasing than in any of the other games WITH CUSTOM CONTENT INCLUDED, if I have to create vanilla sims? Nope. They're just kinda weird-looking, in my opinion, and I'd much rather play The Sims 3 if I'm not gonna include custom content.

Now, one thing that should go without saying is that EA IS VERY GREEDY. This isn't news to anyone, I know, but I'm just saying this to emphasize that if you're not planning on buying any DLC for this game you may as well just go on a lawless maritime exploration of it instead of purchasing it, because the base game itself is NOT IT. At all. It gets boring after a while.

My strategy going forward is probably going to be: play game > forget it exists > remember it exists > get the cheapest pack I can > play game with its new features. The DLC is very expensive, though, and that is something to remember. The Sims 3, for example, is worth playing with just the base game installed, in my opinion, so if you don't like to get absolutely scammed into giving EA your money, maybe try that one? Just don't get the Katy Perry stuff pack if you do decide to buy DLC after all. It's not worth it, bestie.

(So, yes, while I know I am scamming myself at this point by monetarily supporting this game, I decided to do it anyway! It was an impulse-buy. But I digress,)

Overall, The Sims 4 has gotten a lot better since it started. It's had a few hiccups along the road, and that's without counting the Star Wars pack, because I refuse to acknowledge that it wasn't a random fever dream I had. But it has gotten better, and I'd say it's worth playing if you pick a few DLC that you think you'll enjoy, and some Custom Content to your liking! I'd also recommend some mods like MC Command Center or other story progression mods just to make the game more realistic and fun. The Sims 4 community is active as hell on places like The Sims Resource or even Twitter and Tumblr, so make the most of it for your modding and/or objects and clothing needs. If you're not going to be taking part in any of that, though, for some reason... I'd refrain from playing this game at all. The Sims 4 is like sliced bread. You probably don't enjoy sliced bread by itself, or eat it very often, do you? It's plain, basic, and boring! The community provides some extra ingredients. If you won't be making a sandwich, you might as well not buy the plain-ass bread."

I broke down during the summer sale and bought the base game and several of the extras. I've been playing The Sims since its first version. When S4 came out I thought it might just be a money pit and stuck with S3, despite the many bugs 3 had. S3 had an awful lot of content.

I'm giving The Sims 4 a recommend, but barely. The first impression of it hasn't been as good as I'd hoped, and I'm still on the fence about cost/benefit. Here's a typical pro/con list after the first inning or so:

Some Pros:
- The graphics. By far the most beautiful of the Sims games and with a slightly better create-a-sim interface, although see Cons below. The in-game look is terrific, especially the lighting, and the different ""worlds,"" which are really just neighborhoods your sim visits, load faster than they did in 3. This is because each neighborhood is small. Instead of forty lots and properties in one place that have to be loaded, you have maybe 12 places to each neighborhood with more neighborhoods, and travel is fast. The energy in the game was very clearly channeled into making everything look great and to take you much faster to a place you want to visit.

- The more sophisticated mood manager. There's a state-of-mind thing in the game beyond the basic needs. You can be inspired, happy, energized, focused, and the total package of moods has its own benefits. Neat idea.

- Bigger, smoother group gatherings. Putting a group together in the Sims 3 was always an iffy, glitchy, chaotic affair. S4 has a much better party function, including the Get Together expansion that has clubs you can join. Dancing is hilarious.

- Great expansion ideas, particularly having to do with environmental responsibility (but, there are too many expansions with too little content added to each one, so we're back to the money pit).

- Lots have a vibe to them. You can choose mood characteristics for a lot just as you do for a sim, so a lot can boost a sim's progress in certain pursuits.

- Cute little kids and pets (with an expansion) who show natural behaviors that are often funny and adorable.

- A few convenient streamlining decisions. Your sim doesn't have to wash every dish in the house anymore, for instance, although it's weird to have god (you) just pick up a dirty plate and ghost it into the trash can in a game all about chores and self care.

Pro/Con:

- The new content has some fun little surprises that weren't in S3, but these are often pros with cons attached. The objects in the new version have some neat interactions, although some of them simply don't do what they advertise. Patchy the Scarecrow, for instance, hangs out and watches TV--creepy--more often than doing anything in the garden. If you don't want a pal from a slasher movie then you want to keep him locked out of the house. When you hire a ""professional gardener"" the expensive contract worker stops by, waters a few plants, skips five other things that could be done, then charges you and goes home. But the bird feeder is fun.

- Too easy to botch a big decision. You need to be careful about how getting married works or it won't go as the interface implies with its vaguely-labeled choices. You might want to use YouTube or Twitch streams before you make any life-changing choices. I tend to micromanage my sims, so if you're fine to just watch the random behavior show and see what gets set on fire, then you'll like the autonomy on and the hold-my-beer nature of some of the commands.

I'm saying ""pro"" and writing ""con"" here. That sums up the Sims 4. You get nothing without paying for it in some way. My hope is that in time I'll just memorize which moments of programming stupidity I can get around.


Cons:

Some of these are pretty big. Gameplay in S3 was slow because of bugs. Gameplay in S4 is slow because your sims are simply dumber than bags of hammers.

- I don't know who decided that you can play the bejezus out of a piano but cannot for the life of you feed your toddler on less than four tries and two hours of wasted time, but the most basic element of The Sims since its invention has gotten a little lost--time management. You can't just pick up your toddler and walk downstairs with the kid. Oh, no. Takes hours unless you pick her up, indicate where you want to put her down, do that, then pick her up again to place her in the high chair, which may or may not happen, before you give her a bowl of generic food, which may be too confusing for your adult sim who understands music theory to accomplish in less than an hour. The kid in the game will likely be more patient with this than you are before she disintegrates into sadness and fills her pants because her other needs depleted while you were hammering away at meeting just the one.

A shower in this game can take all day. Sims stand in place or just do something else when you give them commands--that's with autonomy shut off. With it on they'll simply ignore what you want them to do. They collapse into instant mood meltdown because of a thunderstorm.

- There are tons of options for conversation, for things to buy, for things to do. And you will not be allowed to do them. Fascists designed this game. You have to reach level 10 of some profession to get an item. You have to be a comedian in order to become a musician. You have to figure out some puzzle sequence of interactions in order to achieve something that should be simple. If you like to cook and let your sims eat what they cook, they will be fat. You have to work out like the entire cast of Guardians of the Galaxy, including Rocket, in order to just keep the basic shape your sim had in create-a-sim for long stretches of that sim's life. Your wardrobe is still limited by function rather than just listing all the clothing and letting your sim wear what you want the sim to wear (without using cheats). The controlling nature of the design does not make the game ""more challenging"" unless you consider standing in a bread line with your government-issued ticket a fun challenge. You have to find your fun in a more zen way, just watching the neat stuff the game actually lets you do when the programming doesn't get in your way.

- You might like a game that works best only when you use certain cheats. I like a game that's programmed so you aren't constantly tempted to revert to cheats.

- You can't decide how long you want your sims to live. S3 had specific numbers of days you could set for stages of life. S4 just gives you ""short"" or ""long,"" and you have to squeeze in what is sometimes an unreachable goal into a life. S3 did some of this, too--the architect career track, for instance. Sadly, S4 didn't solve some time management problems from S3 in a time management game. I have read that you will likely never reach the top level of running a veterinary clinic before your sim dies, no matter how workaholic your sim is.

- S4 got rid of vehicles, which seems like another way to undercut The Sims rather than make it more... simmish. When you want to go to another neighborhood you just fade out and show up in some cloud of transcendental teleportation. There's a space ship. There isn't a junker for you to drive to work while you save up for the cool sportscar. Strange, and not cool.

- The price tag. It's hard to say you'll be getting what you want specifically from this game for less than $75 beyond the base game, even at the sale prices. Wait for the packs to go to at most $7.99 and wait for the game to age a little more so that the $40 expansions cost $25 or so.

- Origin. Does anyone like Origin? Is that possible? Origin is the capitalist goon element that EA never needed and that turns every experience into navigating a giant mall to find a restroom. When I load a game I want to play the game, not open the door to another Jehovah's Witness offering me another pamphlet. I paid my money, Origin. Get out of my interface."

First off, we all know giving money to Evil Arseholes is nearly as bad as giving money to ISIS... so let's say that you buy the base game of Sims 4 for $40... is it worth it, and can you enjoy the base game? Yeah, probably.

Now then... the game has over $800 worth of DLC (because Evil Arseholes), so is it worth it to pay $800 for all the DLCs? HELL to the NO. You can literally just use CreamAPI and unlock all of it gratis, plus you'd still have an intact soul afterwards.

Sims 4 is an incredibly good life-sim game, and should be proud. It's just a shame that chose to get in bed with this devil publisher, and then allowed the devil to backdoor them (and their games) for the past 20years+

Really good but difficult. It was hard after we competed it, getting the ball in the goal. I liked that I could play with dad, if it was 1, we wouldnt have played it because there is two of us."

Despite the gameplay taking around 3h in total, I have to admit that every single second of this game was well spent, and there were so many genuine moments I actually laughed out loud for once.

The game has a wonderful playfulness to it and I simply cannot describe how much I needed a game like this. I can imagine that I would place this game close to my heart at any age, too, and simply the silliness yet ingenuity of the gameplay is wonderful, as well as the amount of fleshing out the game has for how short it is.

If you feel like you want to relax, feel a little silly, and have a real fun time, I highly recommend Untitled Goose Game.

(Late Edit: Forgot to mention the music in this game adds so well to the playful atmosphere)"

Great game to play with your kid(s). It's a mischievous game full of ornery behavior, but it's all relatively harmless and simple fun. It's a nice change of pace for a game to have minor dubious objectives instead of being a destroyer of worlds. The music flows with the game depending on how you're interacting with the environment. It shifts between soft smooth pleasant classical music when you're exploring and then louder more scattery sounds when being chased.

All in all, it's my son's (5yo) favorite game, and he's already put dozens and dozens of hours into it. Incidentally he's now getting into speedrunning and has even gotten the ""Garden Quickly"" achievement which I think is pretty impressive for a 5 year old."

There are likely support groups for those personally victimised by geese out in the real world but with recent events, the ever-present threat of vicious waterfowl has all but fallen out of public consciousness. Untitled Goose Game is one of those rare golden eggs which crop up from time to time and gives the player the opportunity to fashion a feathery comeback.

For those who have been sleeping under a rock for the past year, Untitled Goose Game gleefully burst onto the scene in September 2019 after a year of social media hype, with a PS4 and Xbox One release later in December. Initially an Epic store exclusive, Steam users are finally able to get their beaks into it as the release coincides with a nifty little local multiplayer update, but more on that later.

The concept is simple, you are a horrible little goose out to terrorise a quaint British village in as many ways as possible. From the relatively simple act of dumping gardening tools into the local pond, to the complete victimisation of a particularly nervous and bespectacled young idiot, there are countless opportunities to cause mischief. A to-do list provides some necessary direction and completing tasks on the list allows progression through the linear level system, unlocking new areas to go and cause trouble in. And as far as gameplay goes, Untitled Goose Game is pretty straightforward. Your orange and white feathered menace has their versatile beak and raspy honk to use whatever objects can be found lying around, in order to achieve as much mayhem as possible. Sending villagers on —quite literally— a wild goose chase. Thinking outside of the box will often tick off secret objectives and unlock achievements, of which there are plenty.

The graphics are simple, but that all adds to its charm. The most amazing thing about this game is in the detail. From the sounds your evil avian makes as he flip-flops his way across different surfaces, to the echoes that honk back at you from a well. The attention to the small things makes this game feel polished and solid. That’s not to say there aren’t small glitches, which is to be expected from a physics puzzle game, but they aren’t intrusive and end up being a barely noticeable hiccup in what would otherwise be an excellently developed game. The soundtrack is simple yet masterfully scored, making use of classical piano compositions from Debussy which dynamically change in mood and pace depending on the situation. It unobtrusively sits in the background providing flourish and support to the rest of the game.

With the latest update, the game takes on the moniker of Untitled Geese Game allowing a second player to get in on the action locally. This opens up a ton of opportunity for collaborative scheming, and when working together seems too friendly, you can always make things difficult for your partner. You are, after all, a feathery menace to society. As an added bonus, the Steam version supports Remote Play Together, removing the requirement to be sat next to your player two.

From the first to the last, House House have packed a ton of fun into a relatively lightweight game. The price of £15 may send some gamers into a bit of a flap as Untitled Goose Game sits in the higher price bracket for a year-old casual game, but the current introductory discount reduces it to just £11 which is more than reasonable. That said, this reviewer originally bought the game on the Switch last year and loved every second and having just purchased the Steam version, remote play with distant family is now possible. A welcome distraction in the current climate for little more than the cost of a couple of coffees.

Overall, this game is definitely worth a gander. Because after all, who wouldn’t want to be a horrible little goose? 🦢"

♦️ Untitled Goose Game
Untitled Goose Game is an entertaining game that revolves around a goose terrorizing innocent civilians. Every couple years we get an indie gem like Goose Game that completely blows up out of nowhere, and I look forward to finding the next! It is a short experience that prioritizes player experimentation and never outstayed its welcome. This will be a shorter review as the game is short and relatively simple in itself, short and sweet (Just like a real goose).

Gameplay
→ The gameplay itself is not the most innovative, but that is not the focal point to begin with. It can be simplified as picking up items, interacting with items, moving the goose around, and of course honking. Through your short playthrough of Untitled Goose Game you will be set in five unique areas that all have their own secrets for you to discover.

→ Once you’re set loose in these areas you will have a sort of ‘to-do list’ to complete. While that may sound like you’re going through the motions and just doing whatever the game is telling you to do, that is not the case. The game will set these absurd tasks like “having a picnic” or “lock the shopkeeper in the garage”. And the fun is not being told what to do, the fun is finding out how you are supposed to go about completing these tasks. This topic flows perfectly into the next section, that is the beauty of player experimentation and how well it is done in Untitled Goose Game.


→ This is what makes Untitled Goose Game the gem that it is, the exploration and experimenting to see what outcome you get is an exciting time. You have you the goose and all the perks that come with being a goose (honk!), with that and the environment you are set on a mission of terror. The world here really is your oyster, given a list of vague objectives you are tasked about how you can get these scenarios to occur.

→ The situations that occur are charming and unique, no two objectives are the same. This is really the main attribute that makes Untitled Goose Game worthy of a purchase. The game is essentially one big puzzle, and you must help the goose unravel these problems.


→ The visuals in this game are stylized and further enhance the ‘indie charm’ that is already so prevalent all throughout Untitled Goose Game. Instead of going for hyper-realistic goose 4k textures we get this beautifully cel-shaded art direction. The environments here are like the cartoons you used to watch as a child and being paired by playing as a goose, it does it’s best to bring your inner child.

→ The sound direction perfectly compliments almost every aspect in Untitled Goose Game. The gameplay is wacky and cartoony, the art style is charming and cute, and is all tied together by the soundtrack. When you are exploring the town and not up to mischief the music that plays is delightful and happy, when up to no good the soundtrack quickly follows your lead and plays more intense sounds.

→ Another welcoming surprise is how well the sounds of the environment are. Everything from a retail store door chime to a water sprinkler all have their own appropriate sounds. This really enhances the world to the next level, as interacting with the environment is a major facet in this game.


In conclusion Untitled Goose Game is a game that is perfect to play and forget about the stresses of the real world. The game offers a one of a kind experience of playing as a goose with only one thing on his mind, misbehavior. While Untitled Goose Game is an exciting and unique twist on the typical formula games feed us, I am not sure if it is a must play. The content provided is fun on its own, but what you get isn’t really worth full price. I heavily recommend that if you have interest in this game to pick it up on sale to live out your fantasies of being a goose."

I bought this for my kids and they love the heck out of this game, as you can see by the current 345 hours total it has been played thus far. They're always laughing and they love to play this game together, its really helped them with their controls since one plays with keyboard and one plays with an Xbox controller.
Even though they have both mainly moved on to Minecraft nowadays, this is still a game they come back to every so often."

When first advertised, I almost felt as though that Untitled Goose Game was just a Goat Simulator clone. Due to the Summer 2022 Steam Sale however, I got to give it more of a look before buying it. I decided to buy it and give it a whirl. The premise of the game is to complete a To-do list to get from one stage to the next. The To-do list involves puzzles being completed by way of gathering props and being a nuisance for the humans in each stage. In short, the gameplay is highly cathartic in a nonviolent way.

Aside from the wonderfully fun and cathartic gameplay, I was most impressed with the sound track of the game while you play. It will only play at certain moments and only if the humans notice you and chase after you. For reference it sort of reminded me of the pianist expressions heard while watching the ""Land of Make-Believe"" sequence of ""Mr Rodger's Neighborhood"". Needless to say it adds a very charming personality to the game."

Things I Like About Untitled Goose Game:

1. I too, want to become a menace to the society over a church bell sometimes.

2. ""The Rake Is Indeed In The Lake"""
untitled+goose+game,Recommended,4.1,"Posted: January 23
Untitled Goose Game is a stealth puzzle game where you play as a goose whose mission in life is to be an absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.

The controls are simple: you can honk, flap your wings, and pick stuff up with your beak. Instead of being open-ended, the game gives you a ""to-do list""; most of the game is trying to figure out how to stealthily accomplish each of these tasks. The tasks are rather varied and take some critical thinking to parse out exactly what the game wants you to do.

All in all, there are 4 areas which cumulate to roughly 2-3 hours of mainline content. After you reach the credits, extra tasks will be added to the to-do list, which bump up the playtime another couple hours, if you're willing to take them on. Most of the endgame content is pretty bland by comparison (5 of the tasks are to ""speedrun"" the original tasklist, which I found pretty easy and repetitive), so the main game is where most of the fun is at. I didn't find the playtime to be objectionable, like other reviewers did; a simple comedy game like this doesn't need to overstay its welcome. Having said that, if you're a gamer on a budget who wants something deep and involved for your money, well frankly, I don't know why you're looking at a freaking goose game homie.

The game doesn't control well with a mouse + keyboard, so a gamepad is highly recommended. Not a big deal, but this can be annoying in multiplayer if you've only got one controller and want to use keyboard for your other player.

The minimalist art fits the premise quite well. It uses classical music (Claude Debussy) for all of its music, and though in some ways I felt like that was ""an easy way out"" compared to making an original soundtrack, I can't deny that it fit here nicely.

Truth be told, there's not much I can be critical about with this one. I got a few chuckles out of it, the premise never got old, and I left feeling pretty satisfied with what it gave me. I was thoroughly entertained, even if it's not the type of game that will stay in my memory for very long. Just a bit of silly fun as a goose."

A short and sweet lil' adventure. Def contender for greatest game title ever.

I'd imagine this would be a great title to play with family (especially family members who aren't really into gaming.)

Clean and crisp graphics and overall game play, no crashes or setup nonsense.

Objectives are just the right amount of difficult for what is supposed to be a low key, relaxing game with a renegade goose for a main protagonist.

Standard price is high for a game with minimal replay value, but the rare sales are well worth it for sure.

Overall a fun time that can be enjoyed by all :)

HONK / 10

Had a ton of fun watching the bf play it. Had even more fun actually playing it. Gonna try it out with couch co-op, which I'm sure will be even more fun (and definitely a lot more chaotic).

You basically play as a goose who goes to different parts of a town, like a park, a pub, some houses, doing typical goose things like...uh- making people trip, stealing their stuff, having your own picnic and of course, .
I mean, there's a dedicated honk button. Just honking at people, watching them get hella surprised or scared is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hilarious. . There's a to-do list which gives you all the objectives that you need to complete to progress through each area, but because it's a sandbox game, there are various ways to do these tasks. It's not like you only have to stick to the tasks given either. The whole point is that you cause as much mayhem as you can and have fun doing it.

Game's pretty short. First run's gonna take you about 2-4 hours depending on how you play and it's best played without taking breaks. The level transition is pretty smooth and feels organic. It doesn't get stale or boring at any point and is constantly engaging you. Plus, after you finish the game, it gives you extra things that you can do, to make your run...even more chaotic (plus, some speedrun type quests, to increase the challenge).

Untitled Goose Poem

The game is not about some duck
It is done well, it does not suck
But is you want a game to choose
You might decide to play this goose

You got some people to annoy
And chase around the frightened boy
You have to fill your to-do list
They shoo away, but you insist

These people do not understand
You do not break, you just amend
Their lives are full of useless things
You fix that flaw with open wings

They need to hear the righteous voice
To honk or not, it is your choice
It does not suck, it is done well
So play some goose and ring the bell"

This game is a delight! It's fun to harass the humans and figure out how to do the things on your checklist. The goose controls / behavior are perfect. A lot of work went into the controls and animations for the goose, and you can tell. It is very satisfying to just goose around in the world. My young kids love watching it, too! The only realistic complaint I could see is that it is short, perhaps 3-4 hours for the initial lists, and maybe another 3-5 for the extra items. It feels appropriate for the concept, though. Any more levels and I think it would have lost something or been stretched too thin. I would definitely play a DLC, though! 10/10 would honk again."

I’m a game developer and I’m overwhelmed with how toxic the industry has become in the last 10 years due to greed and venture capital. Games have transformed from actual toys to play and have fun to machines for juicing and parasiting on users’ addictions and cravings.

In that context of our society, Dave The Diver is an amazing relief and gives me back my inner child passion to get back to making videogames that really are fun to play, to make an art form with love, to make content just for the sake of telling a good interactive story, to give a nice moment to people.

This game is a 10/10. It never stops giving you new content and new core mechanics even in the late game. The game has lots of minigames to solve, and when you thought you’ve seen and perfected all the core mechanics, suddenly a new map, town, or challenge is unlocked with completely new mechanics to learn and master. It doesn’t recycle too much, it doesn’t take the easy path, its development demonstrates what is really possible when you make something with love and real effort and not just for an easy cash grab.

I want more games like this. I want to make games like this. Not a single lootbox in sight. Not a single child becoming a gambler as an adult."

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
The trailers do a good job of explaining what the core gameplay loop will be. Dive into the ocean collecting fish, turn that fish into sushi to use at the restaurant where customers pay you money, turn the money into upgrades, go back to diving with better gear, rinse and repeat.

What may not come across quite as strongly is how well paced and soothing everything is. Diving around for fish does have moments of punctuated panic where you're trying to expertly dodge sharks, or land shots with your harpoon gun to reel in that particularly agile fish you've been hunting; but the vast majority of the time is simply exploring the ever-changing cove and gently floating alongside the local marine life.

The jumps between the panic and the breezy bits is really well done. The restaurant management makes for a nice change of pace between your dives and the additional layers that come later (I'll refrain from mentioning the other things you'll visit/ manage later in the game) mean that even after 16 hours; I was still finding new directions that the game would go in.

There's not a lot more to say than that. The animations are delightful, the characters and the dialogue is funny, and the gameplay hits the note between panic and relaxation really well. I'd heartily recommend Dave the Diver and I'm looking forward to where else this game goes once it's out of early access."

""Just one more dive...""

I bought this game completely on a whim because I kept seeing it advertised everywhere and saw all the glowing reviews. I went in blind, not knowing much besides ""catch fish during day, sell them at night."" I was expecting something with a very simple concept like Moonlighter but I was pleased to see it's much more than that and there's a lot to unpack here and so much to enjoy. There's a lot I personally love about the game.


- The addictive gameplay of filling out essentially a fish pokedex (like animal crossing)

- The satisfying loop of catching a bunch of fish, selling them at the restaurant you manage, and using the money to upgrade Dave's diving equipment so you can progress further, deal more damage, upgrade oxygen tank, etc.

- Wonderful soundtrack. It's got tense scores during boss fights to just more relaxing chill music while on a peaceful dive, and I'm someone who almost never pays attention to the soundtrack in games.

- Even many hours in I was pleased to still be unlocking new content (for example, a farm to grow more crops for your dishes)

- Some of the random minigames are so much fun. I wasn't expecting to suddenly have to play a rhythm minigame sequence as Duff, the anime loving neckbeard who provides Dave with weapon upgrades, but it gave me a good laugh and just shook up the gameplay a bit.

- All the characters are so charming, even smaller characters are so fleshed out, such as a rapper named MC Sammy who has a popular song called ""Hot Pepper Tuna""


This is one of those games where it's very clear where all the hype comes from once you play it. I can't recommend it enough."

It's not too hard, it's fun and it's addictive. O! And it made me laugh out loud several times because of the characters and the story. It's over the top. Beside all of that the diving is very relaxing and the game doesn't hurry you up so you can make sushi and sell it at your own tempo and upgrade your stuff before you want to go deeper into the story. The upgrades are great and realy help you along deeper/diving into the game. Yep, Dave hit several of my game spots. I really like Sushi by the way."

Product received for free

Dave the Diver is an extremely diverse, distinctive, and captivating adventure RPG. It does not stick to a specific genre and has constant surprises for players. I have never played anything even remotely similar and am blown away at the amount of interesting concepts jumbled masterfully together to create the memorable experience that is, Dave the Diver. This astonishing Indie is well deserving of its “overwhelmingly positive” rating here on Steam and I am ecstatic to see it rightfully receiving its success and well-deserved recognition.

Pros
Constant new content to learn & discover that regularly evolves
Extremely addictive & distinctive gameplay loop







You play as Dave, and you guessed it, he is a diver. Dave begins diving in the “blue hole” which is a marine biological hotspot that provides habitat to a diverse range of aquatic life. Dave dives and collects marine life to be used in the accompanying sushi shop. Dave soon finds himself entangled in the mystery of a long-forgotten “sea people” civilisation and will use his diving skills to discover more about them and help various other characters along the way.

Whilst there is a strong narrative in the game, the characters are all so lovingly wacky. From the Anime-girl-obsessed-gun-making nerd, to the stoic sushi chef, or the vegetable loving rapper. Despite the crazy characters, there are fantastic foundations for each of them and I adored them all.



As aforementioned, I have never played a game with as much variation as Dave the Diver, but I will attempt to explain the core gameplay. During the day, Dave is able to dive into the ocean, explore it, collect fish via various methods, pick up objects, complete quests etc. At night, the sushi bar opens and he will help serve there. This means typical Cooking Dash style gameplay, running around clicking on food and taking it to the customer and serving drinks. Have to be quick though, as customers do not have high patience levels. Dave will earn money after each sushi serving shift and this can then be used on upgrades and many other things. The games pacing is absolutely fantastic despite the enormous amount of extra content that gets added later, things are introduced slowly and are generally easy to understand. Perhaps the biggest downfall about this game is the lie I would tell myself after playing until the early hours of the morning, saying “one more dive, then I will go to bed.” Definitely not.


In the beginning, Dave can only dive to limited depths and has restricted cargo capacity. These will increase as different elements are upgraded such as oxygen tank capacity etc. Dave can hunt fish via a variety of methods, using a harpoon to manually pull fish in, or various guns and tools. Everything can be upgraded and there are also different types that can be added such as incendiary, poison or tranquiliser. Bigger fish such as sharks require more effort and stronger guns, and sometimes quick time events will trigger where a button must be mashed to pull in a fish. While diving, Dave must be careful of his oxygen levels as if it runs out, he will need to be rescued resulting in everything in his inventory being lost except 1 item. Oxygen also acts as his health, and if hurt by other fishes or the environment, his oxygen levels will quickly deplete. There are lots of goodies to be found in exploration that can be used in crafting and also includes plenty of oxygen spots to refuel. As the game progresses, players will have access to further locations such as glacier waters, caves and of course, the deep sea. Each area has unique fish to be discovered, with over 200 to find in total.





There is a decent amount of combat in the game, including many boss fights. The boss fights are all exceptionally different and vary in difficulty. As said earlier, guns can be crafted and upgraded to help in the battles. Specific fish will also automatically target Dave if he gets close and these first encounters can actually be quite scary, specifically with the large sharks!



Further to the basic Cooking Dash style mechanics, the menu must be selected daily based off the fish Dave brings back from his adventures. Recipes must be researched, additional staff can be hired, décor can be purchased and later in the game, even a second branch of the shop can be opened and managed. Each dish is priced differently, usually depending on rarity and can be upgraded with special items to increase its value and “tastiness”. This variation from diving to serving was absolutely phenomenal and kept me addicted from the get-go.


I cannot possibly describe everything in this game as there is just too much, and it constantly switches genre. However, some of the highlights include having a fish farm, VIP visits, cooking competitions, rhythm mini games, managing a vegetable farm, side quests, taking photos of wildlife, chase sequences, puzzles, unique segments controlling two characters at once, riding a beluga whale, tranquilising large sharks and using a drone to transport them back to the fish farm and so, so much more. The game can easily be continued after completing the story and there is enough in management style mechanics to keep you busy for hundreds of hours. From collecting all of the fish, to running a successful fish and vegetable farm, to operating and managing your sushi employees and second branch. No two dives are the same.



Dave the Diver is visually stunning, utilising a combination of pixel art with 2D/3D art to create a beautiful oceanic environment brimming with aquatic life. Seeing whales, turtles and manta rays created a sense of awe within me. A testament to the efficacy of the gorgeous environment.



The soundtrack is casual yet addictive, giving a laidback beach vibe, but ramping up the stress during fast-paced sequences. Characters are not voiced, but speak in a robotic monotone voice that at first I didn’t like, but it grew on me shortly after.









22-25 hours to complete the story. 50+ hours for completionists, or plenty of additional content to enjoy after finishing the game.

Player choice

Dave the Diver is an experience that I will hardly forget and is well deserving of its many accolades. It is almost unbelievable that developers managed to pack this much content into one Indie game and make it not only coherent, but brilliant. From a quirky story, an extremely addictive gameplay loop to new engaging mechanics introduced throughout the entirety of the game, there is an abundance to love and I highly recommend it at its bargain full price cost of only $AU29.99."

Dave the Diver is A LOT of things and it's not shocking how all the reviews are OVERWHELMINGLY positive.

You hunt and photograph fish, farm fish and food, unravel mysteries deep underwater, and help run a sushi restaurant. While it all sounds like a lot, it honestly is pretty well balanced. I was surprised just how much content was in the game, especially with it being a $20 indie game.

The basis of the game and the controls were very simple to understand, yet the game still had a lot of depth to it. The music was amazing and complemented the gameplay really well. The visuals and graphics were full of detail and looked beautiful even for being a pixel-like style.

The characters and the cut-scenes are THE BEST PART in my opinion. From an anime-obsessed gun maker to cooking competitions between chefs, the cut-scenes are just *chefs kiss.* I took so many screenshots because of dumb, funny, or cool visuals.

There was also an assortment of boss fights and underwater puzzles that kept the game interesting. There are a ton of different weapons to craft and also a bunch of unique weapons you can find while exploring!
I cannot stress enough just how much stuff is packed into this little game.

Few small things I didn't like:
- The mouse icon isn't at all themed towards the game. While this sounds like something so minimal (and it is tbh), it sticks out like a sore thumb compared to all of the amazing art and details that the game has.
- There weren't a lot of graphic settings. I kept getting some tearing and unfortunately, there was no vsync option. You can basically only change the resolution. Not a huge deal but having options is always nice.
- For how much content is in the game, it can feel a bit repetitive at times. It's a constant gameplay loop of checking all your farms, diving, running the restaurant, etc that eventually gave me burnout but that may have just been because I was 100%ing the game.

It probably took me around 30hrs to beat and 57hrs to 100%.

I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes adventure and restaurant management games/sims. It's a great game to just relax and chill out on."

This game got me through a really dark place in my life. I lost my job, spouse, and home in less than a year. I would chop wood and fish when I couldn't find the energy to do anything else and fall asleep on the couch listening to the background music. But when I played Dave the Diver first time, my whole life changed. The little successes I had were the catalyst I needed to think maybe I could have little successes again in life, too. Highly recommend. Thank you for making this game."

After 40 hours, and 100% completing this early access game, I can say that it's one of the most fun I've played. I keep playing even though there is nothing left to do, and there is no more fish to catch because it is still enjoyable after. My life feels so meaningless now, I eat sushi in the darkness and play the same overpriced FPS in hopes that the full game releases soon.

Im 5.5 hours in so far and this game is really great! The art style is fantastic, the cut scenes have an afro samurai vibe which looks incredible. The game play is well balanced with a great mix of mini games and story quests which break up the main gameplay of supplying the sushi restaurant with fresh fish. The story has me hooked (ha). The game feels very polished and finished despite it just releasing in early access which is refreshing compared to other early access games on steam. My only complaint is I wish the game had ultra wide support. But that is a very very minor complaint."

You may think this game is just diving, catching fish and running a sushi restaurant but its not. Its so much more than that. Its an EXPERIENCE with surprises around every corner. This game combines different elements that somehow seamlessly fit and makes sense.

Its management, fun storytelling, satisfying & addictive gameplay, boss battles, collecting, mini-games, upgrading, exploration, relaxing & sometimes terrifying combat. Not to mention the stunning combination of 2D & 3D pixel art.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
This is a very cute, addictive, and stylish game with a lot of potential. My only complaint is that progression in this game seemed too quick for a restaurant management game. With the gameplay loop being as satisfying as it is, I think the game would benefit from slower progression, allowing the players to just relax, explore, and enjoy their time working towards the growth of their restaurant. Slowing the progression of the game down, coupled with enhancements to the procedural generation of the game so that it feels more varied on each dive, I would very much like to see.

Overall, this game has a lot of potential. I fell in love with the gameplay, design, music, and style. I just wish that progression was slower so that I could spend more time just diving, cooking, and managing my business."

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
This is a fun little game about diving in the ocean, exploring the depths, then savagely murdering every creature in sight as a sacrifice to the gods of capitalism.

The atmosphere is quite nice, characters and creatures are done in a pretty good looking pixel art format, the soundtrack is quite pleasant and generally fits the themes and moods. There’s plenty of little mini games, events and gameplay variety to keep things fresh beyond the loop of ‘jump in, kill fish, make money’ and overall I found the game engaging all the way through until the end of the early access chapters. Just about every cutscene is worth watching at least once - they’re incredibly stylish and good for a chuckle.

The game makes a big deal about using procgen environments and that “every dive is different” but I honestly didn’t see much of that. Creature spawns are more or less static and the areas themselves rarely change their layout beyond small, superficial things. It doesn’t really take away much from the gameplay loop itself, and I probably wouldn’t have even thought about it if the game didn’t make such a big show about calling it out in the first place.

My biggest complaint is the controls. They’re quite clunky, to the point that I’d say the #1 cause of dying for the time I played this was due to some kind of control mishap. It baffles me a bit that in a game about being underwater and more or less free from the idea of gravity that your aim is locked in to +/- 45 degrees horizontally with no way to aim any higher or lower without awkwardly repositioning poor Dave in the midst of having his butt chomped off by an angry shark. The choice to require a button press to begin aiming the weapon with a totally separate button to actually fire, neither of which is terribly responsive, can be equally frustrating in more dangerous moments.

Adding to that frustration is dying during a boss fight/event section commits the mortal sin of making you rewatch all the unskippable cutscenes/intros every single time you restart it - please, a skip button. I beg you.

I do hope the world generation and control issues get polished up before the game releases, but even if they don’t this is still worth a play if you’re in to the vaguely roguelite gameplay loop and exploration stuff."

I started this game at 7pm and stopped playing, only because adulting dictated i needed to, at 3.45am. i was having a blast! each time i was like ok ill complete this and then do go to bed, but a special event happened, or i got a new upgrade. there is SO MUCH CONTENT for early access. how much will there be for the whole game?! if its any indication, its got to be a big game. im really looking forward to playing more, and for the full release. hopefully our progress will be saved and added with full release, but honestly if not, im game to replay! as far as the graphics and game play, i did run into 2 issues. only 2 bugs for an early release is damn good! bringing your phone out will sometimes cause a red and black screen, ive had that happen 3 times in almost 9 hours of game play. i started the dive and my character never showed up in the ocean. that happened once. so 4 bugs in 9 hours for early access is amazing! also, for those who are a fan of Food Wars, it does have some vibes with the vips. thats all ill say.

DAVE THE DIVER

... one more dive and it´s 2 a.m.


The game in a nutshell

DAVE THE DIVER is a pixel-art management action-adventure. Dive by day and run a sushi bar in the evening. Apart from managing your staff, enobling your interior, collecting ingredients and obviously hunting fish for your menu card (which you change daily depending on your hunting success) this game offers much more, but I´ll try to keep it as spoiler-free as possible - it needs to be experienced. The gameplay loop though is highly addictive and once you think you´ve seen it all the game surprises you with another possibility to expand your business, another activity as e.g. mini games or one of its genious and charming cutscenes that introduce the next story or continue a previous.



+ beautifully designed - the art style, atmosphere and music/sounds are great and perfectly underline the game´s mood
+ explore the ocean and decide what it´ll be on today´s menu
+ lovable characters with amusing interactions
+ hilarious cutscenes and humor in general
+ many pop culture references
+ manage your to-do´s, crafting, social media and more with apps on your ingame cellphone
+ time events that are always managable
+ very polished for an EA game
+ as mentioned the gameplay loop is highly addictive - 18 hours in three days says it all
+ several storylines, all of which intertwine beautifully
+ end bosses for some of the quests and stories
+ easy 100% for those who care about achievements


+/- although the game uses procedurally generated environments, most of the areas repeat themselves - I hope that this feature will be strengthened in future updates for more variety during the dives


- the only negative for me is the QTE parts that appear when you try catching some of the high tier fish, but that depends on and minimizes when you get better gear. The reason behind is just a skill issue - as an older gamer my reflexes are in a downward spiral and I totally suck at QTE...



Although it´s just January 2023 this already is personal GOTY material and there is a reason for the overwhelmingly positive rewievs it has. DAVE THE DIVER still is in Early Access and I´m thrilled for its upcoming content. And since we´re talking about a food related game I´d like to mention that a good meal, and in this case the game itself, is the outcome of the right mix of ingredients, passion and invested love for every step of the work. And that you can feel in every single corner of the game, the attention to detail is truly amazing. This game is so good and entertaining that time really runs and I had to force myself to go to bed. Highly recommended if you´re looking for something unique that already is a masterpiece in its current EA state!"

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
What is this?! One of the best games I have played. Don't let the pixel graphics fool you, this game has a lot of gameplay elements and story in it.
You are a diver during the day and have to explore the sea to catch fish, find treasure and react to any sudden situations. You basically have an Oxygen meter to determine how long you can stay under the sea. It is also your HP meter, if you are hurt, you will lose some oxygen. When you are out of air, you will be saved and taken back to your ship but you can only retrieve one item.
For any fish or sea creature you caught, you sent to your restaurant for it to open for the night. You have a restaurant management mini game which you have to design the menu (from what you caught in the morning or from previous day's leftover), manage your staff, and serve your customers. Repeat the next day. The good thing about this game is that there are alot of side missions and quests for you to tend to during your undersea adventure. I won't get into too much detail here but there are still new stuff unlocking after 10 hours of play time.

Anyways here is a quick summary of pros and cons of this game:
Pros:
+ Lots of gameplay elements
+ Multiple storylines
+ Loveable characters and main protagonist
+ Relaxing but occasionally gives you a sense of danger and make you fight for your life.

Cons:
- Some Quality of life changes needed...
e.g.1. the drink pouring minigame continues for like 5 seconds even after you finished pouring and locks you out from doing other stuff... and if you don't entertain them they get angry and leaves...

e.g.2. no game loading unless you go back to the main menu, you either make it entirely impossible to load, or you allow us to easily load please)

e.g.3. claims the map is randomly generated but there are only a few variations with the same layout, so you will get familiar with them over time.
- FULL GAME HAS RELEASED!


Update after beating the full release:

So it has been a few months and I have put in 30 more hours to complete the game. This game still holds and manage to give me enjoyment from start to end, makes me wanting for more. Though, I can say there are two different meaning of completion with this game. Most people would end it after clearing the main story and probably after getting all achievements. This requires around 30-40 hours. I had a bug so I had to go and replay parts of the game again for one final achievement. And then there are the 100% completion crew. To get 100% completion (e.g. all dishes/staff/weapons upgraded), I can see you will probably need another 30-40 hours. The gap in between finishing the game and 100% the game is colossal. I would love to 100% the game normally but the great effort required made me gave it up. I am sure some people would love this and the game company actually gave you a choice by not forcing any achievements on that is great. Just make sure you note this.

Some notes worth mentioning:
+ Released some other QoL changes that removes the button mashing from the game. This wasn't a problem in my original review because I was playing with mouse and keyboard at first. During full game I tried playing with a controller and that was where the problem comes in. But the devs listened to the community and added accessibility options to simply have you hold the buttons so finally no more button mashing!

- Upgrade cost for staff for the final 5 levels are crazy. Materials required for the final few levels of dish upgrades are also crazy. In general the climb is very steep near the end for each staff/dish upgrade (while the return on investment is the same as before).

- Occasional bugs still exist (normal but still happened too often and had to mention) or not unlocking achievements."

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
In ""Dave the Diver"" you play as Dave, who is not just a diver but also a manager/server at a restaurant, and a farmer of both plants and fish. The core game play loop is Dave diving to collect fish and managing your restaurants menu. Within the game you'll also explore the depths of the (as of current two) ocean maps, complete various quests given to you by a host of unique and fun characters, manage your restaurant by hiring/training staff, and overseeing your fish/rice farm.

The game starts you exploring a small portion of a what it calls a constant changing pocket of the ocean (again only two maps as of now) wherein after learning the controls you'll become a server in the restaurant slowly opening up more game play as you progress.

Things done well in my opinion:
- The core game play loop is enjoyable
- There's a lot to do in the game
- The NPS are silly, entertaining, and the dialog is fairly well written
- Animations are over the top and a joy to watch (skippable after repeated viewings)
- The oxygen as health bar mechanic adds a nice level of tension to the game

What needs work in my opinion:
- There's a delay in trying to rapid fire your speargun that's annoying and makes fighting fast moving fish annoying
- It has the ""Mario"" mechanic where simply touching an enemy damages you, when fighting larger fish this can be very annoying as the tail or fins will destroy you in close combat
- Fish can get inside your hit box wherein you're unable to repel them. If you're heavy this can outright kill you as you're unable to escape
- It would be nice to be able to change the music around and ""Set"" it to different locations. As it is now, you can listen to any of the music you unlocked in the game on your phone but that's all you can do with it.

Overall ""Dave the Diver"" is quite a fun game and I would recommend it to others."

You might say to yourself - How can I possibly lose dozens of hours in a game revolving around running a Sushi restaurant? And for under $20?

I can't stress enough how incredible this game is. I ran out of positive adjectives to say about this game due to me trying to express my profound love for what exists. It's like climbing up your favorite hill, only to realize it's a mountain. But not only is it a mountain, but the largest mountain on earth - only to reveal that it's bigger than that. The audacity of this game to be this good, and so surprising and refreshing for so long borders on illegal.

This game is everything you expect and then tons and tons of things you don't expect - ALL of them fantastic and capable of being their OWN game. Hours into this immersive game, more and more things are being unlocked. Every random tangent you swim on or cook leads you down a rabbit hole of other tangents and unlocks.

This is my game of the year and slowly creeping its way into my game of the last 5 years. You will lose mountains of time.

This is the single best rougelite I've ever played and it's not even close. Dave the diver combines the beauty of some of the most relaxing game play with beautiful visuals, incredibly funny dialogue and characters, and so so so much side content that I've unironically spent more time doing that than I have progressing the main story, you can beat this game in roughly 12 ish hours if you were just pushing for main story objectives, but the insane amount of side content and extra achievements and optional content INCLUDING optional boss fights will easily have you playing for 35-40 hours minimum. The games two main gameplay loops of diving for fish and working at the sushi resturant perfectly go hand in hand, and the more you play the game, the more you'll actually WANT to just be swimming around underneath the ocean doing basically nothing but catching wildlife, fighting sharks, helping people with sidequests, theres just an absurd amount of content here, this game could be 150% of hell even 200% of its current price on steam and I'd still say it's worth it, this is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ gem of a game and you're seriously missing out if you aren't playing it."

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
I really want to like the game because it is a ton of fun besides one aspect. What is ruining my experience as an older gamer/developer with karpal-tunnel issues are the button mashing controls needed in many aspects of the gameplay. It is ruining my peripheral inputs, that is also why I stopped playing it on the steam deck. I do not think having to mash space-bar, left-mouse, or a button input 20 times in a five second interval is good for your hand and wrist health.

I wish the developers would change their approach and instead like they do it on some harpoons require a key sequence to be entered, aka W, A, space-bar e.g. Maybe give an option in the settings to activate sequential input mode, so people can decide between button mashing or a less hardware and wrist/hand-straining input method.

I will gladly change my review once this has been addressed or changed, for now I do not recommend this game for anyone who is concerned about their peripheral health or has issues mashing the same input over and over in a short burst.

EDIT: Well, seems like we got heard and the devs are addressing the button-mashing issues. So I will gladly change my review to recommend the game! Thanks for listening to the feedback and solving the issue devs! :)"

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
(Excuse my grammar mistakes in advance, English is not my first language)

Dave the Diver is a fun game with rogue-lite elements,
good playful music and a simple but cute story!
The game will keep you busy with these two main objectives:

> Run the sushi restaurant with the owner
> Explore and scavenge this 'mysterious' lake/sea near the restaurant (and catch food for the restaurant)

The game does a great job of alternating the tasks listed above. It keeps the game refreshing and light and makes me look forward to continue the progress that I've just made. It's also a great game for short bursts of playing as every task/section of the game takes about 10-20 minutes and you can just save and quit after any!

Dave the Diver is a relentlessly enjoyable experience. When I played the demo months ago, I could tell that it was something unique and fun, but I had no idea that the final product would be packed with so much content while also remaining cohesive and endearing throughout. Then, to top it all off, it has some of the most hilarious and well-made pixel art cutscenes I have ever encountered. You can stop here and just play it, but if you need more convincing, continue below.

Abbreviated Review:
YouTube™ Video: Dave the Diver Review - Sushi Saves the Sea 
Views: 1,046


The innocuous beginning of Dave the Diver makes it seem like you’re in for a run-of-the-mill management sim and side-scrolling ‘shooter’ of some sort. Your protagonist Dave is a seemingly mild-mannered and friendly guy who takes on any task presented to him with a smile. So, in addition to be-ing the sole diver hunting fish in the occasionally hostile environment of an island-encompassed blue hole, you’ll also be managing the menu, financials, décor, and being the primary server in the restaurant. The only thing you won’t be doing (mostly) is crafting the sushi itself – which is left to your mysterious hardnosed Chef Bancho.

Bancho, like many of the noteworthy characters in the game, has a small story that you get to explore within the gameplay. Character exploration is part of the larger narrative in what ultimately becomes a fairly expansive story with a lot of mysteries and discoveries within it. Like the blue hole itself, the adventure seems basic on the surface but is actually deep and full of secrets. While initially your goals are only stocking and running a restaurant, various characters will wander out to meet you on the dive platform of your small boat to request your assistance in several unique and iterative quest chains. Some of these chains weave into the core of the story while others are just extra tasks that can provide rewards and keep the game rich.

The money that you earn as a reward from some of these quests adds to your primary source of income – the restaurant. This money can be used for many tasks and resources including augmenting the restaurant as well as upgrading your gear to dive deeper, longer, and with better tools to keep you alive. The deeper you go, the more threats you’ll face, but you’ll also encounter rarer sea creatures that can be diced into more profitable dishes at the restaurant. However, that’s only a small portion of what you’ll find in the depths.

One interesting aspect of the journey through Dave the Diver is the process of unlocking the things you need to make it into new environments. You’ll, of course, need more air available as it’s not only for breathing but also functions as your health bar. Any time you’re stung by a jellyfish or snapped at by a shark, you’ll lose air – while also steadily losing it as you breathe. You can find barrels of that life-retaining substance randomly on the sea floor along with chests full of one-time-use resources like underwater scooters and temporary oxygen boosts. You’ll also find chests with new spear tips, guns, and melee weapons you’ll need to fend off and take down larger predators and prey.

Part of the unique challenge any time you dive into the ocean is that you have a sort of roguelike experience where you need to obtain stronger spears and weapons and the environment is slightly different. The undersea environment isn’t procedurally generated, so you will see the same map over several dives, but there are at least a handful of maps to navigate that change with the time of day. However, with the random nature of the items you obtain each time and the progressively more challenging creatures that appear as the story moves forward, it feels a lot more diverse than it is.

The chapter-based campaign is blocked out by the main quest line that uses key items to limit your overall progression. While you can upgrade your oxygen and suit to go deeper as well as your harpoon and weapons to fish more efficiently, even your first steps into deeper water require you to complete a quest for a headlamp. You can sit around avoiding the main quest to fish endlessly and run the restaurant, but the game is built around the excellent pacing that has you balancing that aspect with exploration and mystery quite well. Of the 25 hours it took me to finish the main part of the game, I made only a handful of dives that weren’t connected in some way toward progression.



Dave the Diver’s pacing works so well because it always gives you something new to do. The number of minigames and evolving mechanics is astounding. From the simplest tasks like having a different minigame for reeling in a big fish using each different spear tip to an immersive rhythm-based music challenge you can revisit at any time, you will never be complacent. It was almost overwhelming at times with how any given moment you could be using a mechanic you have never seen before to accomplish your next task. There are entire moments crafted in the game using controls and functionality that happen a single time, which almost seems wasteful if it wasn’t also fun as hell.

Between the minigames, boss fights, ever-expanding roles of spearfishing and restaurant management, and the hilarious cutscenes sprinkled throughout the game, I was blown away by everything presented. For a mere $20, this game provided one of the best experiences I’ve had in an indie game in a long time, and I am hoping that this isn’t the end of the adventure for Dave. The ongoing nature of serving new dishes in the restaurant and the potential to unlock more secret caves or deeper adventures leaves plenty of room for more content. However, even if somehow the developers don’t seize that opportunity, this game is well worth picking up and diving into."

I usually dislike fishing mini-games in other games, so I had my doubts when I saw that this one was ABOUT fishing. However, it was a pleasant surprise how much I enjoyed the game and how entertained I was while fishing. It never got tiring (well, except maybe taking care of the Tamagotchi, haha).

This is a fishing game with several other interesting mechanics. Surprisingly for me, it has a story, and quite an interesting one at that, with fantastic humor. Excellent pixel art, and let's not even get started on the music! This game has such great music; I can't get enough of it.

Basically, our main character, Dave, is invited to an exotic island to try some delicious sushi, but surprisingly, they actually want him to go diving... and, by the way, be a waiter/manager/farmer/fish breeder/card collector/photographer and researcher... among many other activities... Poor Dave, 24 hours a day are not enough.

I found all the mini-games very entertaining, except for the Tamagotchi, mostly because when I was a kid, I hated how much attention it demanded, and the minigame reminded me of that.

I think it's an excellent game to relax while doing some fishing, and if you like it get hooked on restaurant management. Lots of laughs with the cameos and references, as well as the game's overall sense humor; I had a blast, and I might even say I felt a bit sad when I finished it.

I don't know what the devs are planning if they have more content in mind for the game or a sequel, but I'm definitely looking forward to any news!

Highly recommended!"

The first several hours are fun, chill, and full of exploration and adventure as you go on the hunt, upgrade your gear, and plunge to new depths. Around the midgame, it turns into a series of endless dialogue cut scenes, fetch quests, mini-games, stealth missions, and even more of a micromanagement simulation.

I wish I could give this a neutral review, but it hit me that I was just no longer having fun. Certainly this will appeal to a certain kind of gamer, but it just wasn't me."

There hasn't been a game that's captivated me like this has in quite some time. I've put close to 12 hours in and think I'm near the end of the early access content but I keep being surprised by new mechanics that open up. There's a lot more to this game than initially meets the eye, and the mechanics are rolled out slowly enough that you feel like you have firm footing at every stage of the game.

So far, I truly can't find fault with this. The game just oozes character. The art and animations are superb. The music is great. The mechanics are actually pretty interesting and non-trivial (don't be turned off by the ""casual"" tag - there is definitely some challenge to both parts of the game). At the same time, they're not super stressful - the restaurant part of the game isn't a cakewalk (I rarely have a perfect night) but it's a far cry from something like Overcooked.

I haven't found myself genuinely smiling or laughing at a game like I have with this in a long time. To have that alongside genuinely interesting gameplay and all around good vibes is a treat. Definitely recommend checking this out."

I got this game mostly because I was bored and looking for something different. Boy was I surprised by how different this game is. It has the sea exploration somewhat like Subnautica but it's also very much running a shop. You upgrade your gear to continue to get deeper and find newer stuff. You can upgrade your shop recipes as you continue to get more stuff. You can change the shop decoration as well as higher and level up staff of your choosing. There is a book to fill with all the different fish you find so you can complete that too. So far I'm very impressed and happy with this game. Definitely found a gem!"

I got sucked into the initial gameplay loop, which felt like a really robust old Kongregate hidden gem with ""number go up"" upgrade progression revealing more and more systems that also want bigger numbers. But the momentum dies as the core loop keeps getting interrupted for more (and more (and more)) unskippable cutscenes, tutorials, and interruptions. I just sat down to play a quick fishing dive and the day started with two separate quest dialogues with new associated objectives (including one that consisted of calling another character to actually receive an objective). Then a reminder popped up about a two-day timer ticking down that I didn't initiate, and then I remembered tat the day before had set up an entirely new game mode separate from all that stuff with its own currencies and minigames with obsessively deep progression systems, the intro to all of which was set in a zone I couldn't save my progress in. I didn't go collect fish to sell at a sushi restaurant after all that; I just turned off the game instead.

I want to say this is fun in bursts and that hopefully I come back. But right now I still feel like I'm waiting for the tutorials to stop so I can just enjoy my nostalgic game that feels like I'm on a Flash site in the late 2000s, and that is simultaneously surprising to experience at all in 2023 but also reaaaaaaally spoiled by unskippable, unsaveable stretches that are becoming more and more of my time playing rather than that nice nostalgic upgrade grind I was sold on."

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
This game is just perfect. Barely even played 2 hours and I can already confidently call it a masterpiece, and that's before it's even fully released! The gameplay loop is incredibly engaging; it uniquely blends two genres that are usually seen independently - exploration/resource gathering/crafting, and restaurant management/customisation. This works flawlessly and gives the game great variation, preventing it from growing stale, as you are swapping between these two fronts with great pacing. Both sides of the game are enjoyable and feel rewarding, with frequent feature unlocks that add additional layers to the game, customisation options, gear upgrades, and collectibles (namely a Pokémon-esque card system, a perfect optional feature for completionists).

The combat feels fair and can honestly be avoided in many cases, making the game accessible for most players, as it caters to casual playstyles as well as allowing for more intense intentional challenge.

The pixel art is gorgeous, 2.5D was the perfect choice of medium - the world is vivid and the art style feels unique. You can tell how much love was poured into it just through the visuals. There are detailed, animated pixel art cutscenes to accompany certain restaurant upgrades, and their inclusion showcases passion (as in, the game would feel no less whole if they were absent - their existence is just a cherry on top).

Originally Dave the DRIVER, the main character enters a coma and proceeds to become Dave the Diver.

Game is great and a lot of fun, I rarely recommends something before finishing the actual game, but there's so much content and everything is so much fun that I cannot help but to do so, even if the base game only had around 20% of what it already does, it would be a good purchase.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Wonderful little game right here that came out of nowhere for me.

It has two parts to it...

1. You have the diving elements where you have to get fish for the sushi bar. You go diving for fish and other goodies.

2. You then have the Sushi bar part which is you making the menu based on what fish you got and help out when customers come

It is a wonderful mix and super chill. Also lastly the dialogue is great, its a real wholesome game in general but especially with the dialogue.

If you want a fun chill and relaxing game that is a nice mix of adventure diving and fishing in the water and also sushi bar management give it a try!

No joke at all when I say this is in my Top 10 games of 2022, which includes the likes of Elden Ring. The game has a ton of charm, fun gameplay, nice art design and just wholesome all the way around. Already in great shape, I can't wait to see what else gets added to the game down the road, its a wonderful start here.

Fantastic game. Very addictive gameplay loop, great music, great game to play to destress and relax, and hilariously entertaining cutscenes. My only complaint is that it is kinda short as I've been able to do most everything in it in about 15-20 hours of play, but it's only $20 and it's still in EA so I'm sure I'll be getting a lot more time out of it anyway.

And they're constantly adding improvements as well. Was going to put in feedback that we could use a sort option in the recipe menu and they did in today's update (are they psychic?).

Very addictive in all the right ways!

Update post release:
Still loving this game but with the full release, we've got some new content that doesn't feel fully fleshed out yet. Stuff like:

Enemy movement can get kinda jank

Bug where the game forgot my keyboard existed (only once thankfully).

Some minigames are a little wonky. Mario one has weird spacing and the stealth level is meh

Could use more breathing room between events

Less button mashing. Could use an accessibility option for it and just turn it down anyway. My keyboard is going to call the police on me

Overall, still loving the game, would be a 10/10 were it not for the above issues and it's still like 9/10 with them. Excellent game that could use a couple updates."

( full review with screenshots: https://www.gaming-parrot.com/post/dave-the-diver-review-low-pressure-diving )

I wish I could leave a neutral score, but given the options I'm closer to recommending it than not.

Dave the Diver is a laid back game about diving into a semi-randomized ocean trench in order to catch loads of exotic fish to supply a sushi restaurant. Or, at least, that's what it is at the beginning. Dave will still be a diver at the end of the game, but along the way he'll end up moonlighting as a waiter, a farmer, a gambler, and many, many other things. There have been plenty of games over the years that start with a ridiculously ambitious concept and only implement half the systems you'd expect, but Dave starts with a very simple concept and dumps an MMO's worth of subsystems on top of it. There's no denying that it's unique, but does it work?

The early systems certainly do. Diving has a whiff of roguelite about it since the things you'll encounter are slightly different with every round and you're forced to find most of your equipment in the water. The first biome mostly has your standard tropical fish that you'd expect from a glance at the game, but you'll find more interesting encounters as you go deeper. Although the diving gameplay is largely the same from start to finish, boss fights and one-off encounters shake things up occasionally. It does feel pointlessly restrictive that some of the boss fights can only be done on a specific day, especially since you're allowed as many retries as you want, but none of them are hard enough for that to be a huge issue. Outside of some tedious puzzle sections about 80% of the way through the game, the diving is consistently enjoyable.

The restaurant is similarly mostly solid. There's almost no depth to it, but it's satisfying in the same way that old Flash-style time management games were. You pick some fish to use as sushi ingredients for the night and then spend the rest of your time running back and forth between customers and the kitchen to deliver their food or server them drinks. You can hire staff to be able to handle more guests or prepare sushi more quickly, but in either case you're really just spending money to make the game play itself faster. A very late side quest introduces a Cooking Mama-style minigame that I wish had been used more, and I'd also have liked to see decorations have any kind of discernible effect. Buying them feels very wasteful when they don't obviously do anything and the game constantly wants your money for more impactful items.

The systems introduced later in the game are a mixed bag at best. Most of them fit a pattern of being basically fine, but not terribly fleshed out and collectively tedious. You'll have three different farms producing five different kinds of resources by the end of the game, but each of them basically amounts to spending money and then waiting to get the outputs. Any seahorses you catch can be used for racing, but that's just button mashing where you'll win easily as long as your stats are decent. Many of these systems are also extremely grindy. You can improve sushi recipes to boost their stats, for example, but doing this requires spending increasingly huge amounts of fish meat for each level. Similarly, prices to upgrade your farms or equipment escalate quickly and have many levels, so even with an efficient restaurant it can take quite a while before you're able to make relatively marginal improvements. And don't even get me started on the stealth level."

I wanna be brief why I wouldn't recommend getting the game even though it's great in many aspects.
While the game looks and sounds fantastic, the more I play the more I get the feeling that the developers just doesn't respect the time of the player. Every new mechanic (which you will get in an endless rapidfire stream) just tries to be take as long as you can barely tolerate.
The best example for this a the frequent puzzle sections in the story sections. The game tells you without fail how to solve all new puzzle mechanics and then you just have complete them, which comes down to picking up rocks and slowy swim with them somewhere or pull something down a few meters. In the later parts you are also in nearly no danger because your airmeter is most of the time between 70 and 90 percent full when you find the next container with new air.
The only danger in the game are some really annoying enemies, that do obnoxious amounts of damage, and bosses.
Those are awesome for the most part (I even liked the mantis shrimp, even though the tip at the start of the battle will lead you away from the stuff you should really do) but having a cool bossbattle every few hours that you can't even repeat and than another 1-4 hours boring busywork is just soul crushing.
If mintrocket would have concentrated more on making mechanics more fun and less on cramming as much of them in this game, I'm sure this would have been contender for game of the year for me.
I will probably still finish the game and update the review, if anything big changes but for me right now it's a clear no for the recommendation. Not because the game is bad or to expensive but because it just wastes it's potential by wasting your time."

This is a great game and I would have given it a positive review, but one problem makes it unplayable for people like me. If you have any sort of carpal tunnel or hand/wrist issues, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. They force you to do button mashing quicktime events that require you to mash the button super fast. There are no accessibility options to change this and I physically cannot place this game without hurting myself."
dave+the+diver,Not Recommended,0.4,"Posted: July 1
EDIT: Devs have responded that they're working on it, so fingers crossed that this will be a recommend soon. Looking forward to this game.

Each time you harpoon a fish you have to do a lame ""mash space as quickly as you can"" action. Not only is that boring, loud enough to wake sleeping family members, and unchallenging, but it's an accessibility issue. I have a physical limitation that makes it difficult and painful to rapidly smash a key.

Looking at the forum, there's a ~30 page thread stretching back the better part of a year of similar complaints. It baffles that the devs haven't added the option of a different mini game, or at least a simple option to disable the button-mash one. The latter should be a very, very simple thing to implement.

I'd love to play this, but that needs to change before I can. Fingers crossed, but not very hopeful given the radio silence to date."

A great time!

Dives take place in a variable hole of limited breadth but plenty of depth, with deeper regions containing pricier but also more dangerous & resilient sea life. There's a real sense of adventure that comes with a limited oxygen capacity & fearsome aquatic life that can end your dive before it's really begun. While it's not a hard game, there's a real risk/reward to be had throughout the game when it comes to dangerous species like sharks, whose meat might be valuable, but at much higher potential cost. Utilizing the gold you make from selling your sushi is the key to upgrading your gear to go deeper, while also making sure you have enough to run the business. During the story you'll also unlock several items that'll make your trips more fun & open up new opportunities for you.

The management side of things is enjoyable with enough layers to keep you invested, with more being unlocked as you progress through the campaign. There's hundreds of dishes & ingredients to be found & mastered, so making the most of what you have access to is important. Add to that fish farm & farm management later in the game, staffing concerns & more besides, you'll find there's plenty here to min-max if you're into that sort of thing.

The cast is fun & expands nicely alongside minigames, collectathon side content, and a story that's charming despite being a little bit all over the place later on. The game is packed to the brim with references & nods to other games that I'll not spoil here, but they definitely hit the mark more often than not.

It's not all good however. The game has some puzzle segments which aren't really puzzle segments as much as they are time wasters due to their ridiculous simplicity, but that still doesn't stop Dave telling you ""huh, maybe I should pull that lever"" - well, yes Dave, thanks for the tip. The final few acts of the game in general feel a bit scatterbrained & rushed, but they don't detract too much from the overall experience as you can fish/collect/cook as much as you want in the post-game anyway.

Overall, while far from perfect, Dave the Diver's addicting gameplay loop, charming presentation & lovable cast make for an experience I won't be forgetting any time soon!"

Honestly, better than I thought it was going to be.

I'm sorry but I have to agree with a lot of the negative comments that really appreciate the game - just as I do - but criticize the type of game it starts off and shifts to. The comfy early-game definitely wears off after some time.

What starts out as a Stardew Valley with fishes quickly evolves to boss battles after boss battles with forced mini games that reward button mashing and tedious puzzles that are neither fun nor challenging.
Although for some reason some boss battles are ruthless since enemies are large, have rapid dashes and damage you on touching you (so getting bit by a shark is equally damaging as touching his back fin).

Also, a lot of quest interactions are forced and teleport you around without consent. For example you could be planning on getting ingredients and finishing a quest in one run but a lot of times a quest ends in you just getting teleported back to your boat with no way of knowing beforehand.
This can easily be fixed by asking ""Are you ready to leave?"" in some way or form so you can finish looting or gatheting something in your vicinity.

The first few hours were definitely the best, right now it's just getting more stressful and tedious.
When I want to play a game to chill out, this will not be on the list any longer.

While this review might seem negative, I do agree with the positive feedback this game has gotten."

I have been playing it since pre-release and was more than excited for the full-game.
I am more than satisfied!

For people who enjoy single-player games.
This game is a masterpiece.
I am out of words to write a review because I can't describe how flawless it is.
Music / Art / Story / Weapons/ Crafting system / Upgrades / Boss fights and the entire concept is well executed. With the full release they implemented Puzzles as well which are enjoyable!


Oh. And I am Japanese so I might be biased??? I love Sushi. <3

But truly, this game is very fun for those of you who are into playing alone. It encompasses everything you'd look for in a single-player game.
My only sadness is that I know this game might end someday but it will be one of the masterpiece-games I will always remember."

The game was so fun at the start when I was just catching fish and running the restaurant but the devs try to make this game so boring for some reason. So many ""tasks"" that you have to complete are you just holding spacebar and carrying an object underwater from point A to point B, no challenge, no fun just tedium.

There's an underwater fish people village that you visit early on and while that sounds really cool it is one of the most boring parts of the game. The villager quests are so boring and uninspired once again consisting of the same hold space here and move to here mechanics.

A good example of the devs realizing how slow this game is yet doing nothing about it also happens in that village. In the underwater village you move so slowly and the village is massive, simply crossing across it is a 2 minute excursion. The devs must have realized that because they added a underwater taxi that you can ride only in that village, except it triggers a cut scene each time you summon it, it disappears whenever you go into any building and it uses that villages exclusive currency each time you summon it again. Thereby making even the fast travel slow and punishing.

Can't wait for the sequel to this game where you manage a paint drying business."

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
TLDR; This game has a lot of charm. I feel as though there are flaws to the diving experience that make it difficult to enjoy at times, so I can't say that I recommend it at its current state.

--
- The restaurant aspect is quite fun; I wish it were more central to the gameplay! The process of growing your business is addictive, and I think this is where it shines. The animations for special guests, interactive food serving mechanics (like serving various drinks!); the only issue I have is that I wish it could be longer. Granted, I'm only two chapters in, and I understand that this game is meant to focus on the diving part.

Unfortunately, to say that the restaurant part outshines the diving part is telling of the latter's flaws. I have a growing list of issues in my diving experience that is making it difficult to enjoy.

- Scripted diving moments feel too disruptive. I might go down to focus on catching all kinds of fish as well as finishing up a fetch quest for a customer only to end up fighting a boss I did not expect. The rude interruptions of my expeditions (where after certain quests are complete, I'm forced to go back up to the boat and wait for the next day to fish again) is not fun.

There was a countdown toward an event where I had to prepare a bunch of menu items of a specific kind (jellyfish), and when the day came, a quest regarding the sea people forced me to miss the opening of the restaurant. I thought I had missed the event as well and was upset. Fortunately, it did push to the next day, but this felt like a bug to me.

- There should be an ability to reference other info besides quests while diving. I get that having a smartphone underwater is not realistic, but I feel like it's necessary to be able to access info on what fish you need to get (for certain menu items, for achievements). Or even like, where I could find certain fish? All of this is available on your phone and the restaurant, but not while you're diving? Just something to think about.

- Diving controls feel really muddy to me. This issue is glaring especially during combat events; it just isn't fun to struggle because aiming is limited and you can't turn as quickly to avoid wide attacks. I wish that moving around felt more responsive, but it's too slow and limiting at its current state. I know that charms exist to boost certain stats, but in my opinion the difference is negligible.

I am sure that time will either prove that the developers can create a more cohesive, enjoyable experience, or that this game is simply not for me. I really want to like this game, so my fingers are crossed."

This game is absolutely ridiculous. Swiping surfaces up and down in repetitive motions for hours. Cleaning a million nooks and crannies, sitting in front of the computer screen like a hypnotized zombie.
Two reasons why I recommend this game: One, it is the perfect game for switching off your brain, when you want to advance time and you don't have a cryosleep chamber nearby. Two, at some point playing this game, you will pause and be forced to consider whether or not you are living your life to the fullest. Hence, the repercussions of playing this game could lead to a dramatic existential crisis, when you realize all the precious heartbeats you have wasted while being zombified will never come back."

This game stands on a mighty pedestal above everything else with a half-ironic ""simulator"" title released in the past two decades.

PowerWash Simulator is not a sim, and it knows that. Every object you clean is just a texture layered on another texture, and different nozzles/guns remove that texture more efficiently than others. You're waving a Photoshop delete tool around for twenty hours.

The beauty of PWS comes from the writing. This isn't one of the dozens of shovelware Polish 'sim' games pumped out every quarter. The writing isn't edgy for the sake of being edgy to give streamers something to react to during the first two hours. Story and charming character work doesn't magically stop happening after the two hour Steam refund window is up. If anything, the breadcrumbs of story in PWS snowball into a big, goofy, overarching story about wacky occurrences in this small metro area that all - coincidentally - require the services of a professional power washer.

If you've read this far, please take it from me: power through the tree house level. Keep in mind that hitting the C button to detatch your cursor and allow you to move the washer around the screen is a CRUCIAL tool. Ignore the stats on the washers, they're all direct upgrades."

When I am having a bad day or anxious about a situation that has come up, this game helps.

EDIT: Almost 2100 hours I've logged in this game. It sucks that I have to say this: do not buy any of the DLC except for nostalgia purposes. Be careful even then. That being said, not even my extreme Final Fantasy VII nostalgia could make me like the Midgar pack. Spongebob and Tomb Raider? Don't waste your money. This team has gotten away, FAR away, from the winning formula that made this game great. It was unique, it was innovative, but now it's banking on other brands for a fresh breath of life. Now, everything is an intense slog to find every tiny nook and cranny and getting just the precise angle to clean 99.9999% of every dirt speck because your completion thresholds are ridiculous. The base game is worth it, but don't bother with anything else.

Go back to what you started with. Expand on that. FINISH THE STORY. Stop trying to turn a buck because you rode the wave of popularity and are now too lazy to want to do anything but make bank off other people's creations, with or without their permission.

Probably won't be playing this much more except when my friends want to play. This game has become a serious disappointment.

EDIT: Almost 1600 hours in, and I am convinced I was a power washer in a previous life.

I have no life now. I've sold all my worldly possessions except my PC and gaming setup. I live off ramen and multivitamins. I've reset my progress more than a speedrunner playing Ninja Gaiden. I see orange flashes in my dreams, and then I wake up only to be reminded that I missed three tiny specks on the last level I played, so I have to reset everything and start over. If God exists, when I meet them I will ask them one question: ""can I get the extra long extension prior to the fire helicopter?"" To which they will answer ""no, my son, you gotta put in the work."""

I really like this game, very satisfying :)

The only ""grievance"" I have with this game is that it seems things are considered clean when you reach a certain percentage, that's fine for most thing. But my inner perfectionist feels a bit cheated when it comes to big objects like walls and floors, like I'm getting punished for being thorough. I've cleaned almost the entire wall/floor and there's only one big patch of dirt left in the middle. I start on it, but then the wall is considered clean enough and the big patch of dirt just disappears xD and I'm sitting there like ""but I wasn't done D:"" but yeah, that's probably just me, so if no one else complains about it, just forget it, hehe x)"

As someone in their early 40s this game is a god sent. I like shooters, most of my life I played shooters but as of late the kid that killed me and teabagged me called me a boomer 3 times before I realise I am dead. (I need to protest, I am gen x, not a boomer, nor a milenial)

My reflexes have become ♥♥♥♥. And while a few years ago I could compensate my slow pysical decline by playing methodical and strategic I can't any more.

This is where this shooter comes in. It lets me show everything I have learned, mastered, perfectioned one last time. From mastery of shooting angles to choice of right tool (sniper to spray and pray).

This game comes with a really stupid simple premise that's done extraordinarily well - you spray water at things until they're clean. Doesn't sound like fun, but it's incredibly soothing and satisfying to see something covered in mud and dirt suddenly pop with live and vibrant colors - and sorting out a method of which you tackle these projects is a different sort of fun in itself.

Think of it like a coloring book from your childhood - except the giant building is the book and the pressure washer is your crayon. The level of organization (or chaos) is up to you. Do you want to spray a bunch of wangs in the mud? Or do you just want to climb on top of the truck and start spraying from there? The grime is your oyster.

Also, the game has a story for some reason. The people you get the projects from text you while you clean their crap and it's hilarious and charming - there's actually a few of the reoccurring customers that I came to enjoy and looked forward to seeing if I get to do more for them!

The only thing that could make it even better are custom maps. With mod/steam workshop support. This game would reach a whole different lvl of potential and longevity.
I would still reccomend it as it is."

I have played WAY too many hours of this game.... I replay the free-play levels regularly to relax, especially before bed.
I once had a guy come over for a date. He, for whatever reason, decided to immediately sit at my desk where I had just been gaming, opens up steam, and starts browsing my games. Then says ""Why do you have over 250 hours in Power Wash Simulator lol"".

He did not last long before getting kicked out. Unlike Power Wash Simulator, my love, which I have since put 50 more hours in, and counting. SUPER excited with the new (and free!) additions like the Tomb Raider levels, and potential future DLC. Given that I bought it for like $20 and have had THIS MUCH fun with it, its well worth the money if they keep adding things for me to clean. Maybe its because I'm Hispanic, but I really love this game.

I pretty much just exclusively do levels with the highest level power washer to relax, although it is pretty fun to work your way up from the crappy starter power washer to the fancy one with all the bells and whistles. Highly recommend putting on some lo-fi hip hop and just zoning out to this game.

My coworkers are still trying to figure out how to weaponize my obsession with powerwashing by hooking up a real power-washer to a controller so I can clean their driveways. If only...."

I typically try to avoid games that make mundane tasks into gameplay. Games that have the suffix “simulator” usually have weak mechanics and rely on the novelty of playing something that iis normally a chore or a hobby at best. Power washing, however, moves just outside this classification by being a task that usually isn’t an everyday event and has unique properties that make it pretty fulfilling. If there’s one thing PowerWash Simulator definitively does, it delivers an authentic experience.

Abbreviated Review:
YouTube™ Video: PowerWash Simulator - Cleaning with the Cleansing Power of Water | Abbreviated Reviews 


Making a game exactly like reality usually isn’t a good option. That’s not absolute since there are plenty of flight simulators pushing that boundary every day, but people generally play games for pleasure and it’s not always fun to deal with the clunky aspects of reality. The pressure washer you use in PowerWash Simulator doesn’t have any of the typical limitations of a pressure washer. You don’t have any hoses or a need to maintain a power or water source. It’s as though you simply have a gun that can blast away dirt wherever you are without stopping. You also don’t have to worry about the frustration of switching tips for different spray effects since a simple scroll of the mouse wheel achieves that. It streamlines virtually every annoying aspect of high-pressure cleaning with water.

However, when it comes to the actual cleaning part, PowerWash Simulator provides an experience as close to the real thing as I could imagine. Visually, it excellently captures the sheen of water in the wake of the cleaning path and the way it dries on a sunny day. Each of the tips for the wand provides distinct patterns that vary between the highest-pressure beams of water and broad fans that remove only the lightest dirt – but in the widest area. Every soiled surface has distinct properties you’ll need to address and, while you could use the strongest most-precise nozzle on it all, you’d be wasting a lot of time on the areas that don’t require that much effort.

The only limiting factor of PowerWash Simulator is how long you want to spend playing it. You could, if you want, use the strongest and narrowest tip and clean an entire skatepark in one-inch swaths of concentrated water. You won’t get paid any more for this, or less for taking an eternity, since nothing is timed in the campaign. The payment is simply for completing the task in the perpetual daylight of each level. However, I spent nearly 40 hours playing this game and if I had employed that tactic, I imagine it would have been three times that. Besides, part of the challenge is figuring out the most efficient way to tackle those soiled surfaces. That, of course, means testing various positions, washer tips, and spending your money upgrading your washer to the best one available.

There are only four options for upgrading the power washer itself, and despite having a list of stats, each iteration is distinctly better than the last. There are limitations to upgrades beyond just using the money you earn though, you also need to have enough stars – which are earned as you complete each job. I assumed intiially these were tied to the quality or speed of work you did, but it’s simply one star at set points in the cleaning process until everything is clean and you receive the fifth and final one. Once you have the requisite star power though, upgrading is a obvious way to take on bigger jobs with more difficult dirt and grime. For instance, the early washers might not be able to take on paint or other sticky problems, but with an upgrade, you can easily wipe them out.

You can also spend your money on additional sprayer tips that provide unique patterns like a rotating direct jet that covers a larger area with that typically concentrated blast. There are even wand extensions that let you reach higher areas without having to drag out a ladder to place at the predefined locations of every project. If you want to move a little faster on a project, you can also get a soap sprayer and buy a limited supply of detergents that will melt away stains on specific surfaces over a broad area. Using this wasn’t particularly satisfying and seemed like a waste of money in most instances, but I will admit I used it on some levels had huge floor areas that needed cleaning.

PowerWash Simulator has quite a few surprises up its rubberized jumpsuit sleeves. The first, was just how engrossing and cathartic the experience is. Real-life power washing is great and all, but after ten minutes you have soggy shoes and you’re uncomfortably damp from the water that bounces back. In this virtual world, however, you don’t have to deal with any of that. You just have a raw unhindered glory of watching dirt get stripped away. Almost every action you take is progress toward your ultimate goal, so there is no wasted time or even a failure state. You play until you succeed.

It was also surprising that the campaign has a loose but compelling bit of narrative interwoven within it. It’s not anything that’s book-worthy, but it does tie together some of the different jobs you go on, especially later in the game. It is, at the very least, surprising enough that I don’t think I should spoil it for you if you’ve read this far. Yet, I believe its implementation and the strange projects it justifies in the final half dozen stages lift the game a couple of pegs.

Most of my time in PowerWash Simulator I was either listening to podcasts or streaming shows. It works perfectly because the game doesn’t have music and few sounds beyond pressurized water hitting various surfaces. You can also just stop whenever you feel like it and watch a scene because that dirt isn’t going to sneak up and backstab you while you do. However, even when I wasn’t splitting my attention, I was still absorbed by this experience. It’s strange how appealing it is, and how long that appeal last, for something that lacks much diversity in gameplay. Despite my nearly 40 hours in this game, and completion of the campaign, I think I’ll end up back in there soon cleaning some of the last special projects and maybe doing some of the timed or water-limited jobs. Whatever I decide on, I believe it’s worth picking up in its fully released format."

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
The Zen element of PWS has been covered and yes it's the major selling point as you can literally feel the tension in your body melting away every time you boot it up.

But I'd like to highlight the expert learning curve found in the increasingly complex work orders.

You start in a small garage with what will soon be your very own work truck. A easy task with 5 flat surfaces, front, sides, back, roof. Simple enough.

Then things get a little more spicy. Outside jobs featuring common fence posts, rails & pickets that need to be approached from a 360° angle in order to nab all that dirt from every side. Sometime using ladders and scaffolding to treat multilevel targets.

Fast forward to late game and you suddenly find yourself face to face with a rescue helicopter. It's not the size of the job, but rather to unique complexity of all the moving parts. The fine geometric details found within the rotor mast, transmission and hydraulic control unit.

Each new job trains the player to get in there and soak down targets of increasing complexity at a natural pace so it's not just a simple rinse & repeat affair (lol). Terrific pacing on offer here that makes you look forward to what's coming next.

Bright & eye-popping presentation deserve special props too. Along with simply fantastic game-engine performance. The world just feels just fine to inhabit. Super inviting.

Simply put PowerWash Simulator finds itself barreling headfirst to a podium finish of my GOTY Top 10.

HIGHLY recommended."

Exactly what I wanted out of this game. I'm hoping that they'll eventually allow steam workshop to allow people to make their own maps as that would potentially make playability infinite, but really enjoying this so far!

If you like House Flipper or Viscera Cleanup Detail, you'll like this. Very satisfying.

No Man’s Sky is like a guy who owes you $1,000 from 6 years ago coming back with $10,000 to repay you after you thought the money was gone.

I really like this game. I’ve been playing it for years on and off, returning after every major update to see the state of things. No man’s Sky might be a fantastic game now, but you gotta always remember how it all begun. When the game first came out it could best be described to had been as wide as the ocean, but having the depth of a puddle.

The game has improved so much from when it came out that it is easily one of my favorite space exploration games nowadays. One of the greatest redemption stories in video game history. It’s almost like they used the money they earned from sales to actually improve the game.

I love the idea of having this massive sandbox shared experience, where coincidentally anybody can stumble upon my little bases I scattered, mines, etc. I also love flying around the stars in my ship, discovering new planets, finding weird animals, plants, geography…

The sense of adventure and the thrill of finding some new world makes me have so much fun. If you like exploring and just taking your time doing things, this game is a must, and I highly recommend it.

The truth is no matter what you think of the game we should all be grateful of what we’ve gotten. If No Man’s Sky was made by EA, all these updates throughout the years would probably have been released as $60 new games each.

I’ll be honest, at this rate and with these devs I have a feeling No Man’s Sky has a better chance of of becoming what Star Citizen strives to be than Star Citizen.

Every now and then though, whenever I see a game trailer that I really enjoy, I like to remember the state of this game when it first came out and how awful it was. It keeps me in check and helps my expectations stay grounded.

Original Review:
Don't let that ""mixed"" up there under review scores fool you: this game has changed SO much from its disastrous launch back in 2016. When this launched it was, as one commentator put it, ""wide as an ocean, but shallow as a puddle."" But Hello Games did something remarkable: instead of devolving into pay-to-win bullsh*t like we have seen time and time again, they sat back down, got to work, and have spent nearly five years releasing free update after free update, transforming the game in such a way it makes the launch build look like an early access beta.

Want to be an explorer and just find as many planets as possible? Go for it. Want to be a space pirate and just steal all the stuff you need instead? Go ahead. Want to stick to just a few planets and build a mega industrial complex that prints more money than 1920's Germany, then realise that you're way in over your head and need to build a money farm just to build your money farm? Have fun. And if any of this is too boring alone, toss down a portal and invite your friends to play.

If you bought this back at launch and felt like it was boring or shallow, I say to you, give it another go. I did, and I can say wholeheartedly that I was not disappointed.
Bravo, Hello Games. Bravo."

Well the game's good, but this review is mostly for the Hello Games team.

They could run from the game with all our money, they could abandon the game like Bioware with their anthem, they could put subscriptions and microtransactions upon their paid game like what Bethesda do with their Fallout 76, they could put DLC upon DLCs like what so many developers do with their games, but nope. They go back to the office and get ♥♥♥♥♥ done, polishing what should be a giant pile of disappointment into an actual good stuff with constant updates.

For that, the team got my respect for their commendable attitude. Sean Murray probably isn't a very good marketer, but he's a damn good game developer and team leader."

I was one of the many people who pre preordered this game at launch.

I bought a second hand ps4 just to play this game, i was fully aboard the hype train.

After 30 hours in game at launch.. I wasnt angry, just disappointed. But thats so much worse isnt it?

I turned off that ps4 for the final time in august 2016 and never turned it on again.

I ignored every update they released, assuming at its core the game was the same.


My little gamer group decided to randomly give it a chance last week on steam, and oh boy is this game different.

Imagine the hype you felt at this games announcement, imagine all the things hello games promised coming to fruition. Now imagine they added more stuff in... just because.

No mans sky has quickly and vehemently become my new obsession, the gameplay is engaging, immersive, fun and full of ""wow"" moments.
Its buttery smooth, so well optimised and cross play pretty much sets itself up.

You play it for a bit, hit up the wiki for an answer to how to find a good ship, then you spend 4 hours deep diving into the lore, which is where i got fully hooked. The lore is incredible.


This is the game i always dreamed of, and i imagine the game sean and the team originally thought up in their caffeine fueled manic state.

And, they are constantly updating it with major content additions.

For free.

No loot boxes

No dlc

Free.

For anyone asking ""should i give NMS another chance?"" The answer is hell yes, DO IT NOW.

For anyone seeing this game for the first time, prepare for something very, very special."

I've never written a review before for anything but that is changing right now. I discovered No Man's Sky about a month ago. I originally bought it to play in VR but quickly discovered that it was also enjoyable on the PC once I got the hang of the key mappings.

I've never played console games but it's safe to say I'm hooked with just over 150 hours in the last 3 weeks. I look forward to the daily Nexus missions and only have one more before I have enough quicksilver to get an important item, I got my freighter a couple of days ago and I LOVE fighting pirates.

Two things this game will be remembered for:

1. How overhyped and exceptionally terrible it was when it first launched
2. Even an atrocious launch can be salvaged and redeemed if the developers aren't crooks and have passion for what they do.

Probably the best redemption story in game history. The lesson for consumers here is don't believe the hype & don't pre-order. The lesson for developers is don't overhype your games, don't release unfinished games and if things go bad, keep your head down and keep working on fixing and improving even when the world absolutely hates your guts.

Ok. Is someone actually still reading these reviews? Well if you get to this one, among the thousands of reviews for NMS, then you really are committed. As I'm sure you know by now, this game was an utter fail when it was released. The description of the game sounded so amazing, like everything you could ever want from a space-themed, sandbox builder. It was lame and repetitive with a low variety of content. The launch was done all wrong and, the term 'false advertising' was kicked around a lot. Well, luckily the developers didn't stop. It is now a complete game. There are SO many aspects to this game from flight (space or on planet), farming (mining), exploration, discovery, fighting off attacks from animals and drones (sentinels), to my favorite, amazing base-building with SO FREAKING MANY build options. They keep adding new ones too. Hello Games also recently released VR support, and it's really well done. There's something about being able to walk around in the base that you built, in real scale with VR. Hundreds of hours have gone into some of the most amazing bases I've built, and am planning for hundreds more."

Hello Games acknowledged that they messed up by overhyping the game and lying about features that weren't present at launch.

Hello Games buckled down and started fixing the game and adding features free of charge instead of taking the money and running.

Hello Games went from being maligned to admired by most everyone who has played their vastly-improved No Man's Sky as well as their other work, all thanks to admitting fault and fixing their mistake.

Be like Hello Games.

My buddy and I got most of the hours in together and I enjoyed them well, we found a ""paradise"" type planet in the galaxy we spawned in so made that our home planet, built a nice base and called it ""Paradise Islands."" We eventually fell out of the game, as you all know. He also ended up getting rid of his gaming PC and shortly after an unfortunate turn of events, he had taken his own life. I thought I'd never be able to play No Mans Sky alone until today. Over this past weekend I got the Valve Index and saw that, low and behold, its VR compatible. After building up the mental strength to play I decided to see how it goes. I got the controls down before I took off from where my last save was at. Went to a space station, tried to deter myself from using the teleporter to my home planet but inevitably I was drawn to seeing our Paradise Islands again and if it'd changed over the updates at all. When I arrived home, I went outside to check out the surroundings, jetpacked on top of the facility we built and all I see is a massive rainbow spanning from one side of the horizon to the other. I instantly started to cry. The perfect representation of life, its there one minute and gone the next. I gathered the resourced needed, and erected a Golden Traveler statue peering out at where the rainbow was in honor of my fallen intergalactic interloper. I love you dude and I ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ miss you."

For many years, (I am 64), I have played space exploration, colonization and strategy games, hoping to feed my dreams of actually living in and exploring space. I don't have much of a taste for endless combat, I just wanted to explore star systems, planets and asteroid fields and imagine what it would really be like to live my dreams.

No Man's Sky is the closest thing to living in and exploring space that I have found so far. It certainly has room for improvement, but there are so many features and things to do that it has kept me busy so far. Love it."

As everyone knows, No Man's Sky is a modern cautionary tale about pre-release game development. What not everyone knows, but people are slowly beginning to learn, is that it's also an exemplar of ongoing game development. Like many, I bought NMS at launch, and was underwhelmed by it. I wasn't outraged, as so many were, but it seemed like a great example of over-promising and under-delivering. I played enough to get bored with the mechanics, marveled a bit at the color and scope of the worlds while being frustrated with the mechanics, and blundered around without a very well-defined tutorial path. Then I went on to other things instead.

Four years later, all of the good things about NMS have been retained and improved, all of the bad things have been resolved, and features I never even hoped for have been added. The dev team has been responsive, engaged and imaginative. It would have been understandable for Hello Games to fold up, after an Icarus story so painfully acted out, but instead they doubled down on their commitments and have turned No Man's Sky into a genuinely wonderful gaming experience.

I honestly cannot say enough positive things about it. It is a shining example of how game development can work when driven by a team that wants to do the absolute best they can for their audience, delivering content-filled updates regularly without asking a penny more than the original cost of the game. I have looked for ways to give them more of my money, and have settled for evangelizing about it to all of my friends. Especially now - if you have free time, get NMS."

Check out the Internet Historians video for the best description of the fall and rise of this game, but personal opinions on it, I really enjoy it, is a bit grindy at times, combat is pretty solid, ship piloting is pretty smooth, the mission system is cool, and base building is awesome, the game does still has a few optimization issues, and bug fixes that will probably be worked out soon, but all in all the game is a 8/10 not a bad game anymore but also not without its own flaws. i recommend anyone to check it out if you can."

Internet Historian was right.

Whatever was wrong with this game at the outset, is gone. With Hello Games' hard work, they've made a game everyone says was bad, into a game that is actually pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥' good.

And given their track record after release, it'll only get better. I mean c'mon, they could've just taken the millions they made and ran off. Instead they busted their asses finishing this game and making it better than even THEY could have imagined.

I came to this game completely blind and I didn't know what kind of game it was. I just wanted to fly a cool spaceship and explore. But oh boy was I in for a treat... I realise there was this huge controversy regarding expectations and lack of features when it first launched. But the state that the game is in now makes it difficult to see that.

This game ticks so many boxes it's crazy. Build a spacefleet? You just have to ask yourself if you want to be a trader, a pirate or fleet of explorers like captain Picard. Want to colonize a planet? Ask yourself if you want it on a planet like earth or on ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Mustafar. Heck, do it underwater!

And the visuals, my god it's beautiful. Either just flying around in space watching three suns illuminate an entire system of planets, or taking a walk on the surface at night surrounded by glowing mushrooms over 5 meters tall and bioluminescent purple grass.

The best thing about this game is that you can play it however you want. You can be everything from a spacefaring vagabond to a lord of fleets and colonies.

If you want a first person version of Stellaris with a dash of Minecraft, this is it. I highly recommend this game."
no+mans+sky,Recommended,141.2,"Posted: December 21, 2019
Launch controversy aside, what this game should have been called for the longest time is 'Early Access'. Around the time of the Beyond update is when I'd say would have been the true 'launch'.

I didn't get this when it first came out, but even when I did it was a fragmented mess of a game. Now, finally, with the Beyond and Synthesis updates there's a solid game here that's almost (but not quite) like what Sean Murray promised way back at the beginning.

Performance on PC has dramatically improved with the switch over to the Vulkan API, and it finally supports Ultrawide and various other PC-specific options. The game itself provides a significant amount of variety, offering a combination of Elite-lite and 'Minecraft in Space' mechanics. There's plenty to see and do, and the exploration aspect is enjoyable - if a little bland. The planetary biomes and overall game could still do with further diversity, but there's plenty here to get to your teeth into.

Hello Games show no sign of slowing down their support for the game either, having just recently released a bizarre in-game music synthesizer of all things, and going by the evidence of their progress to date I can only see the game improving further as time moves on.

EDIT - 24/09/2020 ""Origins"" Patch: well, you can ignore the previous comments about diversity being a bit on the low side. They already added things like living ships, derelicts, space creatures and robots since I made this review, and with the Origins patch the variety of experience on offer is on such a scale now that I don't think I'm going to be lacking for things to do for some time. Also, impressively, the game runs even better than it did when I originally posted this - and the rejigged UI looks fantastic on Ultrawide.

Brilliant work by the team at Hello Games. I can't think of any game I've played (and I've been indulging since the late 80's) where I've ever gone from ""I can't stand this"" to ""this is one of my favourite games"". It's taken a while to get here, but No Man's Sky is definitely one of the greats."

One of my favorite games of all time. I have 'wasted' an embarrassing number of hours in this Sky. It is not a game for those who like a strong story or those who need a strong sense of direction. It truly shines as a kind of 'chose your own adventure' game.

Do you want to just see how far you can explore and how many planets you can discover and name after your cat? You can do that. And while there is more than a little repetition in the plants and animals found on those planets, there is enough variety to keep it interesting. I have a rather extensive folder of the very different and exotic animals I have discovered in my travels including a cute teddy bear creature as tall as a building and others that you can ride just for the fun of it.

Do you want to just try to find and upgrade the best ships in the galaxies to add to your collection on board your premium freighter that you finally found? You can do that. I have spent hours just looking for the best crashed ships that I can nab for free. It is like a galactic treasure hunt to find (and then upgrade) the most beautiful rides until you have a collection that Jay Leno would be envious of.

Or maybe you dream of building the most luxurious, extensive, elaborate and just plain kick-ass base (or twenty of them) that anyone in this reality has ever seen? You can do that. In fact, you can build one that reaches into the sky, is underground, is under the oceans, on top of a mountain with a gorgeous view. And if you build more than one, you can travel to all of your vast real estate holdings in the blink of an eye thanks to the magic of portals.

Or maybe ships and bases aren't your thing and you just want to become a tycoon with the most extensive collection of mining operations in the galaxies? You can do that too. Or maybe you just want to become a trader who becomes a billionaire by travelling between the different systems buying low and selling high. You can do that. Or maybe you want to become a billionaire but are also a bit of a treasure hunter? You can locate and sell historic artifacts, old bones, ancient tech.

There is just so much to do in this big, beautiful game that you can just follow your whim and do what you want. Make your own goals and then make them happen. Or don't set any goals and just meander. Do what you want and just have fun in the infinite universe!"

Let me tell you my little story about No Mans Sky.

About 4 Years ago, Sean Murray from Hello Games promised me giant Sandworms on the planets in the game he was making. It was promised in one of their pre-launch trailers. I bought the game after some deliberation, mostly because I wanted to see the giant Sandworms. They where my trigger, my selling point.

The game released. It was all a fiasco and a horrible mess. There where no worms, small or large. And the game was missing many other things. I still played it. After all I had some fun, and got some nice screenshots. But it was not what was promised. This was worming me deep inside since then. A feeling of betrayal and broken promises. I did not write a review back then.

Since back when I played the game on launch, it got many updates. I was surprised and liked what I saw on improvements over the years. But it was not enough to bring me back to the game, or heal the deep wound inside, even if the game got a lot better, and some of the broken promises got patched in.

But now No Man's Sky got its Origins Update to version 3.0
Now Sean Murray delivered to me what he promised me.



I will have to return to the game now, and watch the giant worms.

Sean Murray, is forgiven.
The wound is healed.
The worms have arriven.
I fly again.


Thank you Hello Games.
You earned yourself my positive review now.

UPDATE: As of the latest update for the game, I'm almost tempted to change my review to a negative as a huge relaxing part of the game has been all but lost to the never ending, every minute or so invasion by pirates, in pretty much every station and on every planet in the game.

I get that the devs are trying to make it more exciting, but it's beyond frustrating to be alerted to another ""Hostile ships incoming"" warning after fighting off some pirates not two minutes before. Now repeat that over and over again.

Worse yet, if you're like me and die in the water (yes, the pirates will even kill you while you're deep under water), you have to swim out to get your stuff again. Now, while you're on your way to or from your gravestone, grabbing your lost equipment, there just might be (probably will be) another group of pirates who come and kill you again.

It's relentless, and each time you're killed, something in your inventory gets damaged, so you have to worry about that now, too.

Not a fun thing. It might be more fun if the frequency were dialed down a bit.

This game had a disastrous launch. Sean Murray seemed like a lying over-promising cheat, at launch.
They could've taken the money they made and run with it, millionaires all of them.
Instead, they stuck around and made the game better and better, expansion after free expansion, improvement after improvement.

No Man's Sky went from a good concept to a beautiful reality.

This game deserves all the love it can get."

One of the best comeback stories in modern videogames. Strongly recommend for any would-be scifi adventurer into spaceships, alien worlds and space exploration, and base building or resource exploiting. I absolutely HATED this game at release after it absolutely botched the landing in apocalyptic fashion, turning all of the hype around it into one of the most stunningly underwhelming and disappointing slogs I'd ever played. That said, the commitment of the development team to rectify that massive blunder is one of the most admirable efforts I've ever seen out of a developer. They could have taken the money and ran, but they really dug in to make their game as great as they dreamed about in their head before launch and this game has come a LONG way in a BIG way because of that, and is an entirely different and far more worthwhile experience. Just watch a video of what this game was like at launch and compare that against the history of even just the first 4 updates yourself for the proof in the pudding. BARRING the catastrophic launch, this game could serve as a great template for continuing to support a released videogame. If they stopped the updates right now, hell even 3 updates ago, the game would stand as a valiant success against the odds of a pointedly deserved animosity.

The history of this game starting as one of the hardest failures in the industry wont be forgotten but that arguably serves it well, and makes for a great story for just how much hard work and dedication can improve even the worst of failures into a rousing success."

Product received for free

Honestly I can't recommend this game enough. The developers being absolute chads is reason enough for me. let me give you the timeline of updates so you can make your own opinion though.

The Foundation Update - November 2016
Now you can build a base on planets and farm resources from them as well as a plethera of other things you can use to make a base that really fits your needs and looks good while you're at it.

The Pathfinder Update - March 2017
Now you can build underground garages in those bases and drive a whole fleet of vehicles around the planet for easy access to places starships can't get to. And it also looks bad-ass.

The Atlas Rises Update - August 2017
Now instead of aimlessly wandering around the galaxy you can follow a storyline that will simultaneously show you the intricacies of the game, and peak your curiosity. 8/10 story overall for me.

No Mans Sky Next Update - July 2018
Possibly the biggest update the game ever received. This update turned the lonesome singleplayer experience into a full co-op. The greatest thing? It's all optional. When in-game, simply go to settings and find the Network section, there you can toggle all multiplayer actions, and you can even disable the multiplayer entirely. Just watch out for endgame players suddenly giving you overpowered items, or trolls giving you trash items for fun. There isn't a way to toggle other players ""gifting"" you things yet, but we hope this will be a feature soon.

The Abyss Update - October 2018
One of my personal favorites. This update adds entire oceans to the game, and even some planets that are one big ocean. This also added a whole plethera of marine plants and animals, and underwater ruins sometimes filled with, ahem, ABYSSAL HORRORS. The game calls them that, and I fully agree.

The Visions Update - November 2018
This update added a huge variety to the planets of the galaxy. It added new trees, plants and flowers, new minerals, and rock formations, new animals to roam those new lands, and rainbows and exotic trophies to hunt down inside these new environments. It also added ancient bones you could dig up and buried scrap you could salvage. As well as new community missions that helped people earn rewards as a group.

No Mans Sky Beyond - August 2019
This update worked to expand the variety in the settlements and space stations, as well as improving the Nexus Hub (The social hub for players to interact). This update also added VR support to the game. While it does take a beefy pc to run VR well, and there is still no left-handed support, the experience of a space battle in VR, exploring a planet in VR, and talking with other people in VR is quite the unique experience.

The Synthesis Update - November 2019
This was another quality of life update, improving upon many different aspects of the game. To list the major things, an improved Star Map on your spaceship, ways to upgrade your starship, ways to scrap uneeded starships, improvements to the Terrain Manipulator (The tool used for digging and moving the ground), and a way to save outfits for character customization. As well as many other smaller improvements,

The Living Ship Update - February 2020
As the name might suggest, this update added a freaking M E A T S H I P. You get it by doing a questline in which you hatch a mysterious egg. And yeah, it's a little gross to look around the inside of the cockpit. This update also added many new space encounters (One of my favorite parts of the game). Now you can find weird space creatures, destroyed starships, and even trader ships or another pilot who needs some help.

The Exo Mech Update - April 2020
A pretty small update really. It added a new vehicle to walk around planets in: the Exo Mech. The Exo Mech is pretty cool and very useful for a lot of different things. It also improved the system of other Exocraft vehicles, and added a Orbital Exocraft Materializer, which allows you to take your Exocraft with you on your giant spaceship.

The Crossplay Update - June 2020
Another smaller update. This update added crossplay, a new in-game text chat, and a friending system to easily meet with your friends. Besides some other small tweaks nothing else was added.

(You can kinda tell that 2020 hit the Devs hard because of how much smaller the updates got. Don't worry though, they didn't give up on the game.)

The DESOLATION Update - July 2020
Another one of my personal favorites. Did you ever wonder if No Mans Sky could be a horror game? Well, now you can find giant derelict freighters that are filled with gross flesh bugs that will shoot E Y E L A S E R S. Oh, and your life support and hazard protection are dropping fast so you have to collect little packets along the way and huddle next to heaters to not freeze to death. This update also added numerous lighting improvements and added ways to customize and upgrade your Freighter.

The No Mans Sky Origins Update - September 2020
No, I don't know why some updates have NMS in the name and some don't, ask the devs. Anyways, this update overhauled planets again, adding new biomes, hazards, buildings settlements, and some pretty major bug fixes too. Just a nice little variety update.

The Halloween 2020 Update - December 2023... No, obviously it's October 2020. (Idiot)
This update is another creepy one. It improved the derelict Freighters you could find, and it added Tainted Metal. Tainted Metal is a rare resource found during derelict Freighter excursions, you can use Tainted Metal to buy all sorts of spooky cosmetics and decorations for your base. You can even get your hands on a M E A T H E L M E T. nice.

The Next Generation Update - Also October 2020
This update focused on improving the game for console players. (Masterace Forever). It gave the game much better performance on consoles and also increased the max group size of multiplayer to 32. Don't expect it to load very fast though.

The Companions Update - February 2021
This update is yet another of my personal favorites. This update added the ability to tame and train creatures. You could tame a wild animal of your liking, and generation after generation manipulate the eggs to improve and alter your creatures. Now people can walk around with their 50th Generation Mr. Bubbles the space tiger and ride them at 100000000 mph. A very wholesome little update :)

The Expeditions Update - March 2021
This was a very unique update. Not only did it include many important improvements and tweaks, this update also gave rise to the Expeditions. Expeditions are limited time voyages a player can complete for permanent cosmetic rewards. The First expeditions final reward, for example, was the spaceship Golden Vector. An S-tier ship made of solid gold, and a pretty sleek design. Once you were awarded a cosmetic or even useful reward, you could visit a Quicksilver Merchant in the Nexus Hub to collect the reward on all other saves on your account. new and old. Many updates afterward featured unique Expeditions to showcase the new content.

The Prisms Update - June 2021
This update is pretty simple. They improved the visuals of the game. Space is pretty.

The Frontiers Update - September 2021
This is a pretty big update. they added new settlements that you could manage and build up. Not like your puny little base, these are big towns with citizens and everything. Now you can settle disputes between your colonists, approve and oversee construction of new buildings, and improve the infrastructure of your colony so you can start making credits by the millions.
The update also came with many improvements to your own base building capabilities, and some quality of life changes, including more save slots.

I put my fair share of time in (nearly 36 hours at time of writing). I grinded out most everything. I have fully explored several planets, maxed out inventories and travelled accross countless star systems. I spent hours simply building up language database. Do you know what i have to show for it? Nothing. it was a waste of time.

To be clear, this is a beautiful looking game, with lot's of hope and wonder, that leads to absolutely nothing. I spent hours building up resources and inventories and amassing fortunes. With nothing to do with it. All that time spent learning languages, and there was no point. Anything important story-wise, is in common language. I had much hope, waiting for something to happen. It didn't. You build random items and fuels, but that's it. You can only move from one place to another, and very little changes. Buildings are virtually identical and evenly distributed on EVERY planet. You can spot them and know exactly what they are, and what they will contain. They are unbelieveably generic. Every NPC is the same. I spent hours learning languages of a particular race. 20+ building oup relations of 1 of the 3 races, so much so i was able to decipher almost the entire language in every dialogue. Do you know what I discovered? That it didn't matter. As soon as I discovered the 2nd race, it didn't matter that I didn't know a single word. They were identical. Sure they looked different a little, but every interaction was identical. There is no point to any of the languages, they amount to nothing at all. By the time you get enough to start deciphering the exact words, what they have to say is entirely useless anyway. Did you like that outpost you were at? Too bad, you'll never find it again because navigation is terrible. But don't worry, it doesn't matter because there is another outpost that is identical, just jump in your ship and fly in any direction for less than a minute and you'll find the same damn place with a different name.

This game was like the ending of the TV Show ""Lost"", lots of buildup for a complete let down. Accumulate for no reason, talk for no reason, explore for no reason. I like a grind, but you don't even have anything to show for it. You'll never go back to wherever you were, and you'll never be able to share what you find with another human being. Cool, on this planet I'm going to name everything after memes. cool. What's the point? I'll never see that planet again when i leave for the next one. I gave this game far too much of a chance, and too much of my time. Go play minecraft, at least here you can build something. Play an MMO, at least there you can talk to someone. Go play a game with any form of campaign, at least you'll get a story. NMS is like all those games, without the things that make them great. No story, no meaningful building, no social. This feels entirely like an MMO that is empty. Accumulate wealth to buy nothing of worth, to quest with no one, and find nothing of note."

No Man's Sky has come a long way since its initial release. There's a lot to enjoy now, but there are some things I feel I need to mention to gamers like me who are reconsidering this title in 2020.

First, the good news. There is a fair amount of gameplay variety these days: running missions, space combat, building a base, and upgrading your equipment. And yes, you can now do all these things with your friends -- the game supports co-op sessions with up to 4 people.

However, the game is still, at its core, a single-player experience focused on exploring new planets and scanning alien life forms. And unfortunately, most of the other features feel like an afterthought by comparison. Some examples:

- Your progress is saved locally. If the game crashes (and it will), you will lose your progress. This is very confusing in a game that portrays itself as a persistent open world adventure.

- Your base is saved locally, and uploaded to the server periodically. If the game crashes, there is potential for major conflicts, such as two copies of your base being stacked on top of one another, which leads to permission issues and the inability to remove the old copy. Extremely frustrating. The problems compound when you try to build a base with a friend. In our squad, this was easily the most disappointing part of the game.

- Because of the local saving, it is very easy to edit your save file to load unlimited supplies and equipment. The server does NOT verify your inventory.

- There is no resource scarcity. In a game about finding and collecting resources, this feels very odd. Once you get past a certain threshold of ""units"" (the in-game currency), you can easily purchase huge quantities of items on the market, or buy a new ship to shoot NPCs with impunity. The challenge factor goes way down at that point, and consequently so does the fun.

- For all the development effort that has gone into the game of late, there seems to have been a severe lack of QA. The game crashes A LOT. Bugs abound; some are hilarious, some are infuriating.

That being said, this can still be a fun game to put 30-40 hours into with your friends. Save often. Upload your base any time you make even the smallest change. Warp throughout the galaxy, check out new planets, and marvel at the visually-impressive worlds and curious alien life forms you'll encounter.

Base building is not as good as Rust. Space combat is not as good as Elite Dangerous. The market is not player-driven as it is in EVE. The gunplay is subpar by any measure.

But No Man's Sky does all these things _pretty decently_, and the result is a fun romp around the galaxy."

(Updated at bottom)

It doesn't actually feel like a real universe, there are no planetary physics and gravity is the same on all planets. There are no actual solar systems. The planets don't rotate around a sun but are stationary, sitting together in a blob. The moons don't even go around the planets.

All of the various wonders of the universe (neutron stars, supernovas, pulsars, etc) are entirely absent. There are no stars, they're just part of the skybox but you can't fly to them.

The 18 quintillion planets that was so heavily marketed isn't impressive when you realize what that actually means: if you took 11 things and come up with 50 variations for each, that is close to 18 quintillion combinations. Most planets are entirely the same but with different bumps and colors, they have the same objects on them and largely the same resources. Once you've seen the first dozen planets, you've seen them all.

You don't have a sense of scope/scale to your journey. In the galactic map you can see other stars but there's no sense of where you are in relation to the center of the universe. Likewise you don't have a way to track where you were. No mapping or history, waypoints or other ways of tracking your progress.

The only way to travel between systems is to open up the map and click warp, which initiates a loading screen animation and loads up the new planets. There is no deep space. You feel like you're in an instance with 3 or 4 planets that are mostly the same, then you load up a new skybox with a new set of similar planets. It's nothing like say Space Engine, where you actually do get a true sense that you're in a real universe.

You can't manually land your ship, you simply press a button for it to autoland. Tons of other maneuvers (like entering a space station) are entirely autopilot. The asteroids which are everywhere have insane pop-in issues, they only show up like 50 meters in front of you.

The freight ships don't move, they just sit there passively forever. They add zero gameplay depth.

The space stations are all basically the same.

The planets are littered with outposts, all identical and with a single NPC alien standing still and staring into the wall.

The NPCs are entirely shallow, there is literally no point to even talking to them since they never say anything interesting and simply give you something random you likely don't need. Even the automated quest giving NPCs in Bethesda games that hand out those Radiant AI quests would be a massive improvement.

All of the monoliths are the same, it's nothing but a chore to chase them down. The words you learn don't add any depth to your interactions with the aliens, since they never have anything interesting to say anyway.

The animals are built on 14 different skeleton designs, with a bunch of random animal parts scrapped on top of each section to maximize the number of permutations and there is no attempt to make the animal make any sense in it's environment or have anything unique in it's behavior. The animals have no evolutionary history and their behavior is incredibly shallow.

There are no tall trees like were shown in E3, they're all saplings. There are no large forests, no large creatures. There are no large valleys, huge mountain peaks, no giant volcanos, all terrain is uniformly similar across planets.

The grinding which makes up most of the game is not only boring, but frustrating due to the completely messed up inventory management.

The interface is atrocious. It's amazing that it can be messed up this bad, the fact that we need a mod just to remove the requirement that you must hold each click for a second speaks volumes.

You need to load up a menu to do anything, and the menus are terribly designed and completely unintuitive.

The game is a technical mess. It looks like ♥ yet runs with all sorts of framerate issues.

It fails as a survival game since nothing in the game leaves you threatened. Each planet is seeded with abundant resources, and the few things that do attack you are easily defeated. Compare to minecraft where there's a very definite risk / reward system to exploring a deep cave system. Nothing really threatens you in a meaningful way.

The different minerals and resources don't really matter. Since most of the upgrades to explore the universe are yours within the first hour / two hours all the rest are kind of nice add ons.

There's no challenge to exploring. There's very little combat and what combat there is very boring.

All planets are accessible right from the start of the game. I was excited about the idea of acid planets, radioactive planets, cold planets ... I was thinking that to explore a radioactive planet you'd need to craft some special gear. There was a pretty obvious gameplay loop where the dangerous planets had better minerals/ruins/whatever but were very hard to explore. Instead every planet is basically just a copy of the others.

The constant need to recharge things, which don't really serve a purpose. It makes the game very grindy without any positive feedback. Instead of feeling free to explore the world around me I feel annoyed that if I see something cool it means 30 seconds of tedium while I mine the abundant plutonium. I end up not landing and exploring because of how annoying it is that to take off again I must enter a menu and recharge my ship.

None of the aliens interact with each other or have any sort of AI other than 'walk around a bit'.

There's nothing to sit and watch. An occasional ship will fly overhead but they don't do anything. You never really see a battle take place or the ships acting in any sort of interesting manner.

Update 2019: redacted previous points above that I thought were updated, most points are still disappointingly true. There have been add-ons like the buggies for getting around faster, base building, multiplayer (which was a promised feature from the beginning but whatever) and a few updates to the resource/crafting tree as well as a story. But the reality is that it's just a new coat of paint on a big turd.

I tried to continue from my old save file and all of my blueprints, technologies, some resources, etc. were all gone and replaced with a module called “obsolete technology.” Apparently I saved in a completely dead system cause none of the planets had anything other than sentinels and animals. No beacons, crashed ships, and incredibly scarce resources. Now I didn't have any warp cells nor the ability to craft any to escape this dead system, I couldn't even craft the visor to locate the anomaly the game constantly was telling me to go to. I asked reddit and others for help but was told that now there’s just dead systems from the update and I should just start anew. I started up a new file and threw my ship, now useless multitool, and maxed out exosuit away. So much grinding for nothing.

Turns out the only thing that makes this game challenging is the lack of upgrades, blueprints, technologies because without them grinding for materials to craft upgrades, blueprints, and technologies is super slow. They pretty much just added intermediary steps to the crafting tree (now you must refine the carbon by crafting a refiner and then finding fuel for the refiner). The added story is about as deep and interesting as mining materials. The story progresses by errand running on a galactic scale to the point that the ""characters” which send you on the errands make less and less sense. Somehow the ship controls are worse and make shooting other ships very frustrating. The only challenging part of space dogfights is the ship controls.

There’s still bugs too, a lot. You can fall through the floor of a planet or have your ship spawn under the floor, the game will crash randomly, put down a refiner and then not be able to pick it back up again or its contents.

But every 100 or so planets you visit will be pretty.

With such lack of depth and poor execution Hello Games is criminal to charge more than $10."

No Man's Sky is one of the most ADHD friendly games I've ever played. So many things to do with no time limit as to when they need to get done. When I see something shiny and end up spending hours fixating on it just to remember that I was doing something when I saw that, the other thing is still just sitting there waiting for me.

In general there is something for everyone in this game. If you're a pack rat, you can gather to and inventory manage all you want. Are you a collector? Hunt down the coolest, rarest ships to add to your collection (12 slot limit). Are you into the stock market? You can buy low and sell high with the trade mechanic. Want to learn every language? Fly from station to station asking the lifeforms to teach you their language until you uncover all their words. Each group of aliens has a back story that can be learned going through the main quest.

Though the game is vast and packed with interesting things to do; it is not without it's flaws. On PC (at least), I often find that, after a while of playing the graphics just stop rendering. Everything gets a little blurry and details just stop showing. The only way to fix the graphics issue I've found is to completely reboot the game. (This issue has since been patched and is now working correctly.)

With the new update, the ramp up to combat makes it difficult to do anything that involves getting out of your freighter or leaving a space station. Pirates attack non-stop! In the air, on the ground, if you're in your ship or not, you can expect an attack from pirates. If you happen to hit a sentinel in the process now you have pirates and sentinel after you. These fights take up way too much time and for someone just trying to survey the lands or build a new base it can be very frustrating. (This issue has since been patched and is now working/ Could still use some fine tuning, but is not unbearable any longer.)

The multiplayer mechanic could use some love. My game group and I have found that when we are all in the same game issues can arise. The space station will show that all the ships that come in belong to one person in the group. Traveling together in one freighter can cause falling through the map with an inability to get back in generally resulting in death or a need to restart their game. (We have been able to jump to another system and get one back into the ship with some jump run antics). Solid walls will not show for the guest. If they happen to go snooping they will get stuck inside the the structure with no way out and yep you guessed it a restart will be required. (this issue continues to need a lot of love).

I've found when building (especially large structures) the game has an issue remembering what you just did. Decided to change the color of a whole wall? The game will only remember some of the panels you changed. Need to fill a hole back in, It will only save some of what you filled in. I find myself doing things over and over until it remembers. You'll want to carry around a save spot and save often. ( I am not seeing this happen as often. I think the graphics rendering bug fix may have helped here as well.)

There is currently a bug that causes the settlement prompt to trigger over and over every time you step foot on a new planet if you don't already have a settlement. While this loop is happening it is difficult to complete tasks. It sometimes even stops you from getting back into your ship. If you happen to be attacked during this loop, you would be screwed. The only way to get rid of the loop is to become the overseer of a settlement. If this is not something that interests you, oh well you now own a settlement. (As I now have a settlement, I am not sure if this one has been fixed. if someone in the comments could confirm or deny?)

All in all, I love this game and find myself coming back to it over and over. I enjoy building and love that gravity is not an issue allowing for really neat builds. I easily get lost in a build. With so many material options, colors, and decorations, I can lose a few days on one build (go big or go home). No Mans Sky would be a perfect game in my eyes if they fixed the issues mentioned above.

My favorite thing is finding new systems that no one has been to and renaming everything. If you are the first to discover, the game allows you to rename the system, planets, flora, fauna and minerals. You are also able to rename every ship you acquire along with your freighter, multi-tools, exocrafts, and pets.

I personally have not done an expedition and so have no opinion on that. (Sorry)

I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys free roam exploration, interesting pet options, awesome looking spaceships, base building, trading, space battles, geography, city management, collecting/hording, and so much more!"

No Man's Sky used to be overrated and is now underrated, this game is one of the most tragic stories of any videogame that ever existed. At the start, the game was laggy and bad and didn't have multiplayer so it got a lot of bad reviews. But, weirdly enough, developers continued making updates and now is one of the best games I ever played. An awesome game that has multiplayer, missions, pets, nice NPCs, spaceships and spaceship upgrades, exocraft, monsters etc. The universe in this game is infinite and it is constantly expanding making random planets that makes this game never get old. The coding behind this game makes it only a few gigabytes small with pretty small loading times. It still has bugs here and there but the way things are going I think they will patch all of it.

Let's be real. This game was awful at launch. However...

Hello Games have really turned it around, with large, content rich updates which to this day remain regular and FREE. They could have easily taken the money and disappeared, released paid expansions or implemented MTX. Instead, they built upon the game. Creating a fun, engaging and beautiful experience.

There is something deeply satisfying about warping to a new star system and exploring all of its planets and moons, that few games capture in the same way that No Man's Sky does."

Honestly not a bad game. at launch it was a little barren but was still kinda fun to just sail the solar systems, but with aaaall the stuff brought with the updates, now including multiplayer, its easily worth the original pricetag. and if you're mad that you basically got a early access title at supposed ""launch"", remember that 99% of any other game devs would've chocked it up as a loss and worked on No Man's Sky 2, but these guys actually worked tirelessly for years under extreme scrutiny and prejudice to bring us a game worth our quid, *and they're still updating*.

No Man's Sky is an...interesting situation.

First impressions are everything for a game, and No Man's Sky gave quite a first impression for sure. Pre-launch, No Man's Sky promised to be the game literally everybody dreams about. Touting quintillions of planets, each randomly generated and different from the last, with random creatures, plants, and geology. No Man's Sky was looking too good to be true, and that was absolutely the case at launch.

Nearly every feature advertised in the trailers, interviews, and pre-launch material was missing. Instead, there was a boring husk of a game, with boring planets and same-y fauna.

Then there was the first major patch - Foundation. Foundation added basebuilding similar to subnautica, a survival mode, farming, freighters, and a whole host of quality of life improvements

Then there was the second patch - Pathfinder. Pathfinder added vehicles, base sharing, permadeath mode, more starships, new shops, and even more content. The game was still early, but the groundwork was there.

The Atlas Rises update added a story mode, new planet types, missions and so much more. It fixed major issues with the UI and QOL improvements. It was shaping up to something

Then there was NEXT. NEXT is the update that truly changed NMS for the better. Multiplayer, unlimited base building, community reasearch, third person mode, character customization, and so much more.

Then came two smaller, but still substantial updates, Abyss and Visions. Abyss focused on improving undersea wildlife, and made the underwater sections of the game look beautiful. Visions added variation to planets, trophies, carniverous plants, and improved the visual fidelity.

No Man's Sky was a complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ failure at launch. But that's simply not the case any more. Hello Games has proven that it's possible to redeem something thought to be unredeemable. They made the biggest dissapointment of 2016 into a fully fleshed game, and it's only getting better with time.

I don't think NMS is worth 60 dollars. Not yet. I paid 30, and I don't regret my purchase.

No Man's Sky is, in my opinion, a good game. There is still much to wait for, but I say it is worth the purchase now."

Honest (2020) Review, (From the mind of a simple critic) Industrial Gamers!

Gameplay. This game offers you to be whatever you want to be from the start. The main/side quest helps players learn things about the game and unlocks useful items. All 100% up to you to decide whether or not you wish to pursue them.

Graphics. The amount of visual overhauls this game recieves with each update is crazy. And on top of that their ""Next Generation"" update is arriving soon. I'm astonished how they can keep making an already beautiful game look even better!

Controls. Absolutely 100% Simple. 2 hours in you'll master the quick menu as well.

Sound. This game is FILLED with ambient sounds, pair that with the relaxing music that overlaps it and you have the recipe for one relaxing game to take your mind off of things.

Difficulty. When you start you will hit a learning curve. The game offers so many items and on top of that it's own periodic table, it's kindof hard to keep track of it all. Besides that, npc difficulty isn't much of a threat after you get the hang of the game.

Final Rating - I vote this game the ""LABOR OF LOVE AWARD"" every year for a reason. They stood up against a community and said we won't give up until we give you the game we promised! They've given that and MORE. Much respect to Sean Murray and his team, can't wait to see what other project you all have in store for the future!"

2022 Review

So, everyone knows the rocky history of this game. This review is for the latest version after the Polestar and Endurance updates. Honestly, I feel like the devs have finally delivered on a lot of their promises. This is a fantastic game for those who like to explore and don't want to worry about combat as much.

Pros:
- Infinite worlds to explore with an insane amount of randomness
- The views in this game are stunning
- Fairly seamless loading
- Variety of ships, freighters, pets to collect
- Easy combat if you just want to explore
- Base building on planets works really good
- Base building on freighter is very convenient but there are some bugs currently (bugged refiners)
- Settlements are a fun addition and have potential
- The game is relaxed

Cons
- Still some major bugs that haven't been fixed for YEARS
- Early game inventory, resource, money management can be a pain (I'm an inventory hoarder)
- Combat has very little variety
- Guild & race rankings don't do anything
- The mission board system needs some work, better rewards, & bug fixes
- Some things are time-locked for silly reasons (the living ship missions are the best example)
- 99% of all dialog from NPCs & terminals is nonsense meant to drip-feed you ""lore"" through sentence fragments. There isn't an easy way to skip dialog either.
- The only ""unique"" NPCs exist on the Nexus. ALL other NPCs are clones and have the same personalities.

Overall, I would say this is a great game but expect bugs. My 8-year-old daughter watches & plays this with me sometimes and really likes exploring and finding creatures. The limited combat is easy and still rewarding. The RNG variety of worlds / flora / fauna is mind-blowing. If you are looking for an action-shooter THIS IS NOT THE GAME FOR YOU. If you want an amazing space game to explore that is not punishing, then this is for you.

Overall 8/10"

Probably the biggest redemption in the videogame history.

You have many things to craft and do right now, missions can get repetitive but for example, i spent 25h+ just building, expanding and upgrading my base.
Played some co-op missions and free exploration which made it even more fun.

I watched this video and 30 seconds after the video ended I bought the game, so If you have some doubts, give it a try.
Definitely worth on sale.

I have got to say this game was a complete and utter failure when it launched. So much hype for nothing. But, a ray of hope as the devs pulled themselves together and shot through the darkness of that shadow of doubt everyone cast on you. How did they do that?
By adding MASSIVE updates and fixes to the game. Much more content and is still growing!

So I pre-ordered this.

At the time, when I first played it, I came to regret that as a mistake. I sank a couple hours in here and there, but I just couldn't get into it. The story felt dull, the landscapes were just... off, and it just wasn't what was advertised.

I cast it aside, too late to refund.

Base building came out, along with vehicles, creative mode, and a camera. I played around with them, and they were fun - but the survival still felt lackluster. Creative mode got boring fast, and the camera (probably one of my favourite game features at the time) was hardly worth going into the game to use just for screenshots.

And now, after the Waking Titan ARG - we have Atlas Rises.
To be honest - I'm impressed. Suddenly, I find myself wanting to play survival because it's fun. Hell, I find myself wanting to play the game itself because I enjoy it now, not because I'm bored and need to sink time into something. The story is interesting and I want to see more, dozens of tiny little things that weren't there suddenly are...
It's a new experience.

In all honesty, I would have much preferred to see the game in this state on release. That way I would have been spared a year of disappointment. Hello Games has done what few developers would have done after the disaster of the release, and has spent time and effort making this game into something they can be proud of. It's clear they believe in the potential of No Man's Sky, and I find that inspiring.

I can finally, in good conscience, recommend this game.
I think the price is still too steep - but I would recommend it on half price."

A hard-earned positive review. From abysmal beginnings and broken promises, to a display of loyalty to their users that is simply beyond the comprehension of most AAA publishers. This is the redemption arc we hope that other botched releases aspire to.

Not only is the base game now exceptional, but the consistency of *free* major updates is admirable. It seems that every time I've dropped in on this game, there's been some cool new mechanic or item class to play with. A living world like this is rare to see in something that isn't bogged down in SaaS economics and microtransactions, especially given that the game can be played in an entirely single-player environment if you so wish.

Yeah, they screwed up. But oh man they sure fixed it good too. Labour of love indeed. ♭

I've had my eye on No Man's Sky for the longest time but just couldn't get myself to buy it before because of all the bad press. I finally decided to jump in when the Origins update was launched and let me just say WOW!! While all the criticism when the game first launched back 2016 was probably well deserved, the state of the game as it is right now makes it seem like a completely different game.

Before you jump in as well though it's important to understand that the main focus of this game, at least in my opinion, is exploration. It's completely non-linear, you can play without ever touching the story quests and you'll get by just fine or you can decide to follow the story line to try to answer the questions regarding the creation of the universe.

Among the many, many things you can do, you could focus on creating the base of your dreams, colonizing a planet or if your ambitions are big enough you could also make en entire solar system your home. Maybe you're someone who likes to have nice things and you'll go hunting for the coolest ship, the strongest weapons, a kickass freighter or pimp out all of your vehicles You could have battles in space with your starship, become a space pirate and loot other freighters. You could dedicate yourself to farming resources for construction or trade, or maybe you're more into wildlife and wanna discover the most exotic, bizarre creature in the universe... the possibilities really are endless with this game and weather you go out and explore on your own or with friends, only you are in control of your fate in the universe.

One of the things that surprised me most about this game is the sheer size of it. You start out on a single planet that forms part of a single solar system with multiple planets/moons. That solar system is just one of possibly millions of like systems that form up a single galaxy... and as you may have imagined, that galaxy is just one of many galaxies, each with it's own cluster of millions of solar systems and practically infinite planets to explore. Of course due to limitation of technology after a while you'll start to notice some similarities between planets, but the developers work very hard to make sure that each system is different and unique in some way, shape or form.

Visually this game is beautiful and the soundtrack, while not overly noticeable, sets a good mood for the game. The next-gen patch that was recently announced will only build up on that and we can expect to see another huge improvement to the aesthetics within each world. Some other things to look out for in the future are reworks to the cave systems and sub-aquatic worlds. While present in the game currently, they do leave a lot to be desired and I'm sure that the developers will expand on this in the near future. Hello Games may have had a rough start, but they're dedicated to make this game better and better, and I have high hopes that they will continue to build on this already great game.

Long story short, I absolutely recommend this game. I understand that it may not be for everyone, but if any of the things I mentioned before seem to interest you then this game is definitely for you. No Man's Sky is at a really good place right now and it will only keep getting better, it really has been the comeback of the century and I for one will be sticking around for the long run to see how far we can go from here."

1: The freedom in this game is spectacular. You can go from planet to planet mining and exploring. There's an upside and a downside to this however, and I will address it more in the dislike section.
2: I like how you can modify not only your weapon but you can modify your exosuit and starship/freighter as well. In order to do so, it takes time and thought into what materials you will need for each upgrade/item.
3: The ability to grow in the game regarding upgrades and learning new tech is amazing, and I love how every time I play I have the chance to learn something new about the game.
4: They are still updating this game and I don't see any reason why they should stop either. As long as it keeps drawing in players I think this game will stick around for awhile.

-Dislikes-
1: Addressing #1 in likes: most of the planets feel the same. I understand that the scope of this game is so complex that it would require a ton of memory and data on the developers part in order to make each and every planet unique. With that said, they did do a good job with keeping the planets some-what unique. I would like to see some updates in the future that have more combative alien types along with some new playable species as well.
2: One of the biggest disappointments for me was the fact that when you do modify and upgrade your starship/freighter, you don't see the results on the outside of the ship. For example, when I add a rocket launcher on my ship the ship should reflect that modification and show it somewhere on the ship itself. The biggest reason I started playing this game was for the starships and exploration, so needless to say, it was a little disappointing when I found out that ship doesn't change at all when I add new weapons and gear. The only way to change the look of your ship is to buy a different looking ship.

That's it for now. I'll have more to come later."

No Man's Sky for me is more than a game, it will be my life-time memories. I played with my brother and we had so much fun and our adventures were such trills.

My brother passed away last month with Covid-19.

Miss you bro, hope you will still be playing NMS from heaven or other planets that you've always dreamed of living."

Hello Games is doing exactly what other developers and publishers should be doing, offering a full game that they support and make right even after a bumpy release. I only purchased this game recently, almost 3 years after release, but I did so because the developers keep pumping out high quality content for free. That sort of behavior needs to be rewarded in this current EA/Bethesda micro transaction, horse armor, overpriced DLC, random box of crap unlock, nightmare of a gaming world that we find ourselves in.

I really enjoy this game; there is a lot of fun activity and it is good value for the cost."

This game is not a shooter, not a simulation, not an open world crafter, not an rpg and for very sure it is not action packed in any way. It is an exploration game. It is exactly what it says it is.
If you are missing the mindset of an explorer than this game is not for you.

Is it repetitive? Ofc it is, it is impossible to fill 255 entire galaxies with new and ever refreshing content. It is procedural generated, so things have to repeat at some point. Is Battlefield repetitive? Or Minecraft? Or Fifa? Or The Hunter? Hell yes, they are as repetitive as a game could be. Are they boring? Some say yes, some say no. Yet be assured that they are successful for a good reason. Sames for NMS.

Has it bugs? I'd lie if I'd say it hasn't. But I'd also lie if I'd say the bugs would be awefully annoying, gamebreaking or overly prevalent. It's a huge game with a lot of procedures that can go wrong. That's how free2explore-games are. Period.

Is it abandoned? Neither by the devs, nor by the players. The game received 3 pretty big updates last year with a lot of new content. The community is huge and the most helpful, kind and well behaved... of basically all communities I know so far. Never have i received hate mail, was bullied with ingame mechanics, met a griefer or a cheater etc etc. Yes, there are people using glitches to duplicate items, trick the basebuilding system and stuff like that. And the community knows that those people exist. Because those people are active members of the community and they are as welcome as everyone. There is not a single competitive aspect in the game. If you want to glitch yourself rich: Sure. Do whatever you like. There is no advantage to gain and therefor no one you could hurt. Play the game you want.

Is it fun? Well, does it sound fun to travel from planet to planet searching for something without knowing what that something is? Does it sound fun to feel alone in space? Does it sound fun to play a game that wants you to feel alone? Seeking a purpose? Does it sound fun to play something that basically asks the same question like real life? If that sounds good to you: Welcome to No Man's Sky!"

This game got SO much better. The rating for the game will take a while to improve, but if Hello keeps it up, it will eventually go up. The game today is far different than the pre-order days, and they did a good job making up for the fact that they put out an unfinished game, that didn't deliver on the promises made.

I'm not fully done with the game and I would love to play it again if I have the time for it!

Introduction:
Ah, No Man's Sky... a beautiful, free roaming space exploration game with unlimited or over 18 quintillion planets for you to visit. Why the unlimited? you might ask? Well, I'm not going to visit all of them in my lifetime sitting!

""I'm not alone in this... this is a multiplayer, right?""
~ Me, in August of 2016, after getting off the biggest hypetrain ride ever in history and buying the game in full.

The release:
No Man's Sky is a Space Exploration, Sandbox game with a very... very... VERY... bad start. For starters it was a barren, bug-riddled, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ excuse of an AAA game I've- sorry; WE'VE ever witnessed, don't you agree? We were all there at the release, we stepped all out of the same platform of the hypetrain station all to see God awful, buggy, unoptimised sack of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of a game with little to nothing to do!

You started off with a waking-up-from-a-slumber kind of situation were your spacesuit is booting up, and while that dramatic sequence is rolling to bring some effect to your following gameplay you'll see your that your spaceship is not the only thing that is broken... it seriously looked like a alpha version of the game. Grass glitches, discoloration, random flashes like it's the Matrix...

Want to change some specs at the game settings? Crash. Want to take the first steps in this undiscovered planet? Crash. Want to beam down your laser onto a creature that looks funny? Crash. Want manage your inventory? Crash. Want to say a bad word after the experience? Karma: Crash. Want to compliment the Developers at something they made was actually astonishing? Crash; and taking it back. Want to boot up the game one more time after so many crashes? Crash.

And after that ONE last crash the game wouldn't even want to start up properly, giving me an error. Looking at the time spend on the game; more than 2 hours, making it impossible to refund. And it's just been sitting in my library for the longest time unable the play. After that ruckus I was really amazed that this game thought me one thing and ONE thing only and it really opened my eyes for future games to be released:


This game really haunted my every future move on investing in games. A game that has been falsely advertised on every promising aspect but no actual amendments. Interviews of simple, straightforward questions all being answered as lies. LIES!

The only thing that was highly unnecessary of the community (not all!) is making bomb and death treads, not only on social media but in front of their office as well. Very childish and very inappropriate! A matter of time in court was all it could take, no need for (verbal) violence! Shame to those people!

A very bad start indeed. After so many angry people demanding their money back and not leaving Hello Games alone. But there was a spark of hope, they only needed to follow their heart. Is it the money, or putting smiles on people's faces they're after? Only time could tell you.





Okay things are looking up, but what about the bu-





Okay, we are all very happy with these updates rolling left and right, I think we're all satisf-

















And it doesn't stop there! It seems to never stop with updates that are FREE for us to download. Normally a game company would make us a DLC to buy separately from the game, but not in No Man's Sky! Back in August 2016 it wasn't as we hoped it be, but Hello Games stepped up and never gave up the hope. What started out as a small team has a thriving and flourishing full team of people with the same dream as Shawn: To make an exploration in space game to never forget and live in the experience. Bringing the people joy for their hard work."

Maybe it's because I'm not extremely far into the game yet... but I'm really having a hard time seeing why people think this game is shallow after nearly 6 years. In the roughly 14 hours of my current save, I've managed to do the following:

- Build a small, somewhat crude, yet efficient base of operations
- Defeat pirates and rescue a freighter ship
- Meet a sentient red orb and join its cult
- Join the resistance against that same cult
- Find a magical teleporting Death Star with a bunch of social outcasts (who defy the laws of physics)
- Defeat a bunch of robots because I want treasure
- Begin learning four different in-universe languages (which actually changes the dialogue of the NPCs over time into coherent sentences)
- Discover new planets, animal species, plant life, and weird mineral formations
- Help some dudes named after Greek gods after stealing one of their identities
- Went through a black hole
- Bribe alien civilizations into liking me by giving them presents and poorly speaking their native tongue

And there's a LOT more that I can do that I haven't even started exploring yet, like vehicle building, ship collecting, building massive bases with different farming complexes, link together different portals on planets, become a bounty hunter, smuggle goods, kill a bunch of zerglings...

Seriously, this game has a LOT of content. Don't buy into the idea that the game is ""as wide as an ocean, and as deep as a puddle"", because that ignores the multiple different storylines, in-universe lore and languages, and simple yet deeply fun gameplay mechanics."

I was one of those people that bought this game when it first released, was very disappointed and shelved it after maybe 3 hours of gameplay. Decided to give it another go last week and my god am I glad I did. This game is amazing and definitely worth the €60,- I payed for it years ago. Sure, it's a shame it took so long but if you're looking through the reviews to see if it's worth your money, it definitely is.

Okay... I have logged over 2200 hours playing this game... so I feel like I am justified in giving a review of this game. First and foremost... this is a survival game the is the foundational driver for what you initially do. However, it quickly evolves into an exploration and investment style methodology. in plan language, you have to do a series of things to survive and then thrive, then explore, then gather, build, and enjoy. The variety of life, planets, etc are huge... but not unlimited. You will see variations on a theme... and sometimes it gets somewhat repetitive (or at least it seems)... but then you find that completely DIFFERNT world or creature or mixture of environments that are just amazing. I have played games like ARK... huge fan... this is very similar... as in ARK in space. I love the various aspects... let me just pick one... bases. You can have a simple home on any planet you choose... multiple in fact. Then you can build very complex bases... anywhere... underwater to the top of mountains to underground. You can now manage settlements as well as having your own bases. You can obtain a freighter (capital ship) and build your mobile base there... you launch and store your ships (up to 6) on your capital ship. I cannot emphasize enough the practical and amazing beauty of the game... specifically the multitude of environments. Can you play with people? Yes definitely you can play with a friend or friends. Can you run quests together... the answer is sorta of... but generally, it is better to run quests (unless specifically stated as group oriented) alone. Are there bugs... some for sure... in a game this HUGE and COMPLEX... there are bugs but Hello Games has done a fantastic job in meretriciously fixing and addressing them (not all... but they have not stopped). Can you have pets? Yes... up to 6. Can you modify their DNA through modification of their eggs... the answer is YES. Can you cook... yes. Can you build... absolutely - think Fallout 76, ARK, as examples. Can you fight first person or in ships... the answer is yes... mainly against NPCs... but there is somewhat of a pvp aspect... but not really. Ultimately, if you are not playing permadeath, your death has really no penalty other than you need to go back and pickeup your stuff where you died. No one can really truly steal from you in this game... they can take the things you harvest off of a harvester (resource wise) but it will be available to you when you come to it (as if no one touched it). Thus, there are NO base defenses per se like turrets. There is no need. Can pets protect you from other animals... yes they sure can. Can other NPCs help you in space battles... the answer is yes they do. Hopefully this quick overview and random aspects was helpful to someone. I truly love this game and you will find that there are very generous players that will give you literally the shirt off their backs to help you. Best of luck and happy exploring if you get this game!"

For Those Who TL:DR

Pros:
- Vivid 1970's styles and visuals almost as if it was out of a Sci-Fi art book.
- Procedurally generated worlds, far more then a person can possibly explore in a life time.
- Great procedurally mixed music, performed by 65daysofstatic.
- Can own up to 6 ships and a colossal capital ship with up to 30 escort frigates.
- Exocraft for land and sea (don't have to always walk everywhere)
- Base building
- Co-op Play (up to 4 players)
- Few bugs a seen as of this writing.

Cons:
- Not much story
- Very repetitive structures
- Side quests are largely repetitive.
- Can't sell ships once you have the maximum (you can trade them for others though).
- Game can feel a little bit repetitive at times.

Ideas/Suggestions for the Developer:
- The ability to sell ships
- Build your own Space Station
- Upgrade ships and freighter cargo in a discovered ship yard similar to how exo suits are upgraded.
- Upgrades for the suit to survive space and be able to space walk with thrusters and magnet boots on freighters and frigates.
- Discover procedurally generated tombs, pyramids, structures, monuments, dungeons, etc as well as the current monoliths. Just more diversity in structures to discover.
- For wealthy systems, procedurally generated vast explorable cities with a massive space port maybe capable of landing freighters. And perhaps owning your own shop to sell resources and warehouses for those resources. Something else to do in between exploring.


Review for those who read:

No Man's Sky is a marvel of mathematic procedural engineering. The algorithm uses fractal formulas that are observed in the real world/universe. Texuring, models, music, everything running from a single procedural 16 bit seed (a phone number no less). With 18(10)^10 planets, spread across 255 galaxies, to visit. If you were to visit each planet, each second, it would take you 570,000,000,000 years, approximately 42 times the age of the universe. This is a big game, but I digress. This review isn't just about how technically impressive the game is.

The art is vivid and colorful, all inspired by the art of Sci-Fi artists of the 70's and 80's, such as Ralph McQuarrie, Paul Lehr, Bob Eggleton, and John Berkey. The picturesque vistas, the styles of the ships, and the colorful nebula/gas clouds (even one system apparently is in an all blinding red gas cloud) inspire the need to explore.

No Man's Sky is a procedurally generated sandbox where you explore solar systems and planets. It has a light story arc and generated side quests. NMS isn't scripted like many games and due to the vast scale scale of the universe no in game story could be big enough. Although it wouldn't hurt to have something like a 100 hour plot for the game but that would detract from what the game is actually about, exploration.

Being basically an exploration sandbox, every planet is different and is generally a fresh new experience each time. NMS has a little bit for almost everyone. You can go after bounties, be a space pirate and attack freighters for resources, base building, economy play (no where near the extent of EVE) and co-op play.

Despite the technical achievement, visuals, and exploration aspects. There are a few things that NMS falls short. Being procedural, the game can be very samey. Each planet will generate procedurally on a fractal formula which will fallow similar repeated patterns for most systems (I mean com'on, it's a planet, it's going to have creatures, plants, terrain, and a sky). No planet or star system is exactly the same but will always feel a little similar and familiar. A lot of the structures found on a planet's surface are largely the same, follow similar patterns and offer very little variety. I tend to feel a bit bored after a while seeing the same structures over and over again. I want to discover strange new alien structures explorable with treasures in them and see vast sprawling procedurally generated cities with massive space ports, which I'm surprised aren't added for wealthy systems.

Regardless of the patterning for an average planet, there are planets with absurd if not drug induced features. There are planets with floating land masses, vast oceans, strange objects scattered across the land, and in my experience I found a planet with pink landscape, a purple sky and nothing but dancing mushrooms as lifeforms. Also I found a planet that was nothing but a boiling, acidic, toxic ocean.

Whatever you choose to get out of this game, whether it is to explore the vast number of systems, or attempt to travel to each galaxy. No Man's Sky is an overall great experience.

Personally, I waited a while to get this game due to its rocky launch, but it has grown and changed since then. The developer, Hello Games, is still adding free content and features. It's not quite it's $60 (USD) price tag but hopefully with future improvements and updates it will be worth so much more then that. As of now I recommend getting it on sale, as I did."

The game is genuinely a lot of fun, it feels like a carefully balanced mix of mario kart & forza, while having the charm that all lego games do. It's childish sure, but quite honestly its a blast.

So why the negative review?

To sum it up, 2K's executives have decided to prey on children - this games monetisation is extremely toxic & should not be legal. It is by design made to siphon money from you and wear down at your mental health all in the name of profit. This is a scam dressed up as a game.

The monetization practices are at best predatory, and at worse abusive. This is a full-price game, the full version costing £104 . The executives that manhandled this game to be somehow more predatory than EA need to be fired & removed. Do not support this game anymore than you already have, if you've bought it and can't refund, do NOT give in to the microtransations, they will take advantage of you if you are not able to resist temptations. It is designed meticulously in a way to appeal to impulses.

I keep using the word ""predatory"", and thats for good reason. This is a game marketed towards children, and its built around a microtransation system that hides & obfuscated information. You do not see the price of the coins anywhere in the game, preying on children whose parents aren't tech-savvy enough to have parental locks on steam. They will make purchases outside their means, and that is BY DESIGN. The obfuscation of the price of coins means that ANY CHILD will just pick the biggest number not realising that what they are doing is making a purchase. I was a kid once, I know damn well that 13 year old me would not have been aware enough to stop before making a purchase. Once that ""buy"" screen is up, its over, that child will put down any information they could to get that skin they want.

It is so extremely predatory it should be on a list..

The progression after completing 1/3rd of the game with time spent searching for collectables is BY DESIGN made to frustrate you into getting those coins to get the currency used in the game. After 6 hours I do not have enough of said currency to buy *ONE* vehicle, so you are either forced to pay up more on a full priced game, or spend the next week of your life wittling away at getting a SINGLE VEHICLE. And keep in mind, I did the game at the designed pace, the story is 18 hours, I did a third of it in 6 - you cannot buy one thing in the shop with 1/3 of the games length and thats unacceptable.

That is not even beginning to mention the mental games it starts to play with you right from the beginning, it toys with you at the beginning trying to make these ""cool items"" seem easy to get. The game constantly shoves advertising for its in-game shop, slowly wearing you down until you go ""fine, i'll take a look"" just to shut the character up. It is made this way to annoy you enough, to overwhelm you enough, to break through any fortifications you've built up to get you to give in. Everything about this game is designed to push you into that shop. It locks what could be a very good vehicle creator behind tons of gates & hidden stuff because they want you to be frustrated, you don't have every brick you would need right away, you don't have every vehicle base you would need to make something you want to. You can't even make a completely custom vehicle despite the game very much having the capability to do so.

This is the game that defines the state that gaming has become, its no longer about making a good game - now its about taking as much money as possible. Do. Not. Buy.

This game is predatory
This game is abusive
This game is 2K

Avoid at all costs... Click the ignore button.

I want to recommend this game. So badly. But I cant in good conscience. I know this is published by 2K games but, the microtransaction situation in this game is absolutely abysmal. And horrifically predatory. Especially for a full price game aimed at kids. The first time you load into the main menu, after you make/login to your 2K account, you will likely be immediately greeted by a prompt to buy the ""battlepass"", just to give you an example. You earn a decent amount of currency doing the campaign but once you finish everything your essentially forced to open your wallet if you want anything. As multiplayer races give chump change (Around 10 bucks per race if you win, when cars cost 10k and above). The thing I was most excited for, the vehicle building, is really awesome. But if your given a relatively limited selection of parts to begin with. And you cant make your own chassis. And even more disappointing still, the vehicles you unlock during the campaign dont unlock the bricks used on them for you to use on your own vehicles. And if you want to get more parts, your going to have to buy them from the store. Same with buying the engines that dictate how fast or strong your vehicle is. Which makes your own homebrew vehicles useless if you cant afford a good engine.

The racing is enjoyable, aside from the rubberbandy catchup mechanics. Which remove the skill element of the game, and makes it more based on RNG. And the story is fun. Its got the signature lego humour and jokes which will give you a good chuckle. However the story is very very short. You could probably get it done in one sitting if you tried.

Overall I really wish I could recommend the game, but I just cant in its current state. The game itself feels like it has passion put into it. But having to pay full price, only to have to open my wallet again to get the other half of the game in terms of vehicles and building parts, is just ridiculous. This games probably going to have a short life unless something changes. Im hoping Lego will step in and tell 2k to calm the farm a bit and make things actually earnable in a reasonable time. Cause Im not spending hundreds of hours grinding multiplayer just to get 1 car, that Im likely not going to use anyway aside from the parts it has.

This games likely going to just sit on the shelf once I finish finding all the collectables, and be a waste of my money. Which is really sad, because this was the first game I was actually kind of hyped for in a very long time. But I got burned for it thanks to what I mentioned above. If you really like lego, stick around and see where things go. But I wouldnt jump in and buy it now."

You either have a 60-120 dollar price tag and no micro transactions, or you make it free with microstransactions. You can't have both, and I hope that LEGO decides to put their foot down on this absolutely disgusting practice being used.

Also does anyone else feel like the time requirements for the side challenges is too damn strict?"

I like this game. It's a fun game, and it's got a lot of character. I can't recommend it in good conscience. It's another live service game by none other than 2K Games, the forever runner-up in the ""Worst game company of all time"" competition.

If you're ok with grinding or spending money on a game you already paid premium full price for, by all means this game is for you. If you have enough creativity to work with a limited parts pallette out of the gate, you can have plenty of fun with this game without grinding for even a moment. If you want to just play the story mode, sure, go for it! But I can't in good conscience say ""This is a game for everybody and should be given praise for everything it does right"" because the one thing it does wrong it does to an egregious extent, and will likely only get worse over time.

Overall, it's a fun game marred eternally by Microtransactions and a pretty apparent lack of single player content (which the game expects you to grind pretty endlessly to buy the items in the shop since multiplayer races are worth a fraction of the payout).

In summation: LEGO Racers 3, but at what cost?"

This game at base value is fun but the micro-transactions ruin it. I played it for about 9 hours as of this review, and crashed 3 times. Every crash removed 20k from my currency that you use to buy cars. The game is literally stealing money from you. Thankfully I didn't spend anything on micro-transactions and lost no real money but this is a huge problem. As of now I can't recommend this game and if you do get it, don't spend money.

Edit: My game crashed 9 Times. The new battlepass takes to long to level. You need to get in 1st like 6/7 times just to level once. The game currently has no replay value and I think I'm done playing it at this point."

Never, in all my years, have I been so glad that a game has received little-to-no attention. This crock of wasted potential is insulting not just to LEGO fans who have long-waited for a spiritual successor to the Racers series, but to anyone with a functioning cerebral cortex, and it's all to do with its disgusting, predatory monetisation system.

LEGO 2K Drive is out to get your money in any way shape or form in what is quite possibly the most exploitative microtransaction system I have ever seen for a game which costs anywhere from £50 to a LAUGHABLE £105 at launch.

First of all, the game is literally designed to have no replay value – not only do many of the single player activities serve no purpose other than to frustrate you for single-digit payouts (cars in this game cost anywhere from 10,000 to 20,000 Brickbux) but rewards for races and quests that are actually worth anything drop significantly in value after the first go-around, meaning that, once you've completed all the races, there is virtually no point in playing the game anymore.

Multiplayer payouts are even worse – players have claimed it can take at least 167 hours of multiplayer matches to buy a single car in LEGO 2K Drive, but in reality it's likely much longer thanks to its dwindling player base.

I'd also like to remind you that this is a game targeted at kids. Even the premium shop, dubbed ""Unkie's Emporium"" is designed to look welcoming and inviting to young people in the way it shows off its premium currency and the LEGO cars which, if bought with premium currency, can reach up to £10 for ONE vehicle.

It's a buggy mess, too. Several of the bricks don't have studs for some reason, it crashes frequently, the premium shop is often non-functional, and it has soft-locked so many times it's not even funny.

What's truly upsetting is that there is a fantastic arcade racing game underneath all of this mess, with tight controls, an interesting power-up system, and an enthralling car-building mechanic which would be something to cherish if it wasn't in this game.

Do not buy this game even if it is discounted, the intentionally frustrating mechanics designed to split you with more of your money are not worth it. This game should remain a monument to 2K and Visual Concept's disgusting business practices and LEGO should be ashamed it ever allowed these notoriously deceitful companies to sully its brand even further."

Cant share vehicles with others. I was under the impression it would be added shortly after launch. also microtransactions... in a lego game. If it wasn't called 2k drive id have thought it was an ea game :(


edit: Save game issue still exists and I lost around 10 hours of progress. Do not buy. They wont fix it

edit 6/28/2023: game save issue still isnt fixed and they added a battle pass with almost 100 pieces and parts locked behind it. Please DONT buy this game

edit 7/22/2023: this will be my final edit. After loosing significant progress and facing so many issues it's tough to come back and play. I tried really hard but I can't make enough progress to verify wether or not the save issues were actually fixed. (Wouldn't be an issue if races weren't level gated. Doing menial tasks to simply level up to RACE in a RACING game is ridiculous) Not to mention promised features are still missing such as sharing and downloading vehicles. But hey at least we have a battle pass 🙄. I simply lost the drive to play this game and I recommend you pass this one and move onto better games.

edit 7/30/2023: The promised creator hub came out July 26th shortly after my last update. The creator hub has no working content as nothing new has been added since day one. I cant get vehicles approved for online races anymore which is a huge issue because thats part of the fun. They had no qa testers test this update before they rolled it out and Im convinced they ship unverified code changes like Elon musk. the creator hub broke the game more than it already was. To many things to list here. Dont play this hot garbage unless its free...

I really didn't wanna leave a review, let alone a bad one, but at this point, I feel it's safe to say the game has lost it's charm to me.
I pre-ordered the game as soon as the trailers dropped cause I bought in to the hype cause the autism in me needed this game, after a childhood of playing Lego Racers 1, 2 and Lego Island 2, I got super excited for a new Lego game that wasn't the usual Travellers Tale's style or a minimalistic puzzle game. I was so excited in fact, that I chose to ignore the fact that 2K were publishing it, and forcing their name in the title.

Then I got to play the game and I loved it! It feels great to play and the customisation is so in-depth yet easy to control! I wonder if I can get more pieces from the store so that I can... Oh... The in-game store. And that's where it goes downhill. Where some of the odd features start to make sense. To get a brick pack that will contain 3 or 4 bricks or so is 6000 bux, I believe the highest paying race, the last one in the game, gives a one time payout of 2500 on the highest rank, after which the bux reward for the race is significantly dropped, removing any desire to want to do it again. Although you can complete it on the lower ranks for lower one time payouts, they too, drop their cash rewards immediately, this applies to every race in the game... We can agree this discourages you from racing and replaying the game right?

At the 30hr mark, I have 100% in all but one area, each having their selection of quests and array of collectables(from which I'm missing 7 bux), got gold on every on-the go challenge and completed every race on each difficulty/rank, and believe me, everything rewards you money, however the most I got for collecting all the collectables or finishing a quest was 1,000 bux. In this time, of doing everything I can to complete all this game has to offer, I have bought about... 2 cars? Why? cause they cost 20k each, 10-15k if you want a more simple one. You'd have to replay the last race, the final boss of this game, the Sky Cup, 8 times to buy one car, but that's not even true since after the first time you'll only get around 800 bux for doing that race, so really the maths would be... 23 times, to buy a car, you would need to play the same race 23 times, since that race gives you the most ""bang for your bux"".

This is why I spent my time making my own cars which is great! However you can't even have that for free since you have brick packs you need to buy, so that you can have the freedom of choice. And When I say buy, I do say buy, because a lot of the brick packs have seemed to been withheld so that they can be put in the Drive Passes! Woo! Now you can pay real life money for the ability to earn your digital plastic bricks! And how do you earn them you ask? By playing the games that has a short lifespan by design.

I must confess, I bought the Awesome Rivals edition of the game, and I'm ashamed, not even my humble choice discount could make the purchase cheaper, the £90 it cost me ain't coming back. I should have paid more attention, read the signs. Because this wasn't gonna be a Forza Horizon, where buying the special edition with all the DLC nets you with new areas to explore, hundreds of cars to pick from the get go, cosmetics, No. This edition of the game gets you 4 Drive Passes, 500 coins (which gets you 10k bux, enough to buy a cheap car), a Pizza Oven car, that's already in the game in a different category, and 3 days early access (void now). The kicker is that you have to wait for these drive passes to come out, the main DLC for this game, and that's normal, DLC has staggered releases. But these drive passes don't add new stuff to do, just new rewards to the base game. And I'm already done with the base game. Before Drive Pass 1 even started.

The game has too many issues and caveats. I feel sorry for the Dev team behind the game, since the base game, and story were incredible, it's just 2K's interference, and monetisation tactics that have soured the experience.
I paid £90 for this game, and all it told me was that it wasn't enough :(


ADDENDUM/EDIT/POSTMORTEM: It's been close to a month since the first Drive Pass dropped, no one plays the multiplayer still, I just got around to playing the game again to see what it has to offer and... my opinion of the game has worsened.
They did in fact add new things to do in the open world, roughly 2 On-The-Go Challenges and 3 World Challenges, all of which aren't particularly new or rewarding, they're the same as all the other challenges in game, other than a couple world challenges taking place on floating platforms above the map, which I'll give them, is more than nothing, but that's not saying much.

We now have a separate form of XP for the Drive Pass levels, it's not as common as the plain ol' XP and you need a lot more of it.
I had saved my last few achievements in this game for when the Drive Pass came out, so that I could have something to do while trying to level this damn thing up. But I didn't foresee two quite important things:
1. The achievements I have left are just meaningless tedium, e.g. Drive 3,000 miles, Drive 6,000 miles, Talk to 150 people.
2. I don't want 99% of the rewards from the Drive Pass anyway...
So I gotta say, as a freak for achievements, these are wild, I've played this game for 40 hours (it took like 12-15 hours to complete the story, for reference) and I haven't driven 3,000 miles. The only way you can move is driving, the only thing you do in this game is drive. After 40 hours of driving, I haven't driven 3,000 miles, and they want me to double that afterwards? Do they want me to play this game for 80-100 hours? I mean I knew they put too much faith in this game when they sold 4 Drive Passes, but to drive for 80 hours in a game that has like 20-30 hours of content is insane.
I dread to think how long it would take to get all 400 levels of these drive passes. Not that I think anyone could want to do that. As the only real value is the levels that give brick packs, just because they at least serve a purpose. I don't know why I'd want a Lego Dodge Charger? If I wanted to drive a Dodge Charger I'd play any other racing game? And that's the final reward of the Drive Pass, level 100, along the way you might get the odd thing of note, like a boat that kinda looks like a train, but really you'll only care about the brick packs. You won't care about engine noise #45, or Boy Wearing Red Baseball Cap, or even the odd 1,000 Brick Bux that they kindly bestow every now and then as it's own level, which just sorta says it all really. Some levels give you a car, others give 10% the cost of one.
What f***s me off is that I still can't play as a Lego Skeleton, although really, thinking about it, the real Lego Skeleton was the game I played along the way.

Anyway, I'm sorry for the long edit to essentially say, the DLC we knew was gonna suck, sucks, but I just felt some might care to know the details."

The game is genuinely a lot of fun, it feels like a carefully balanced mix of mario kart & forza, while having the charm that all lego games do. It's childish sure, but quite honestly its a blast.

So why the negative review?

To sum it up, 2K's executives have decided to prey on children - this games monetisation is extremely toxic & should not be legal. It is by design made to siphon money from you and wear down at your mental health all in the name of profit. This is a scam dressed up as a game.

The monetization practices are at best predatory, and at worse abusive. This is a full-price game, the full version costing £104 . The executives that manhandled this game to be somehow more predatory than EA need to be fired & removed. Do not support this game anymore than you already have, if you've bought it and can't refund, do NOT give in to the microtransations, they will take advantage of you if you are not able to resist temptations. It is designed meticulously in a way to appeal to impulses.

I keep using the word ""predatory"", and thats for good reason. This is a game marketed towards children, and its built around a microtransation system that hides & obfuscated information. You do not see the price of the coins anywhere in the game, preying on children whose parents aren't tech-savvy enough to have parental locks on steam. They will make purchases outside their means, and that is BY DESIGN. The obfuscation of the price of coins means that ANY CHILD will just pick the biggest number not realising that what they are doing is making a purchase. I was a kid once, I know damn well that 13 year old me would not have been aware enough to stop before making a purchase. Once that ""buy"" screen is up, its over, that child will put down any information they could to get that skin they want.

It is so extremely predatory it should be on a list..

The progression after completing 1/3rd of the game with time spent searching for collectables is BY DESIGN made to frustrate you into getting those coins to get the currency used in the game. After 6 hours I do not have enough of said currency to buy *ONE* vehicle, so you are either forced to pay up more on a full priced game, or spend the next week of your life wittling away at getting a SINGLE VEHICLE. And keep in mind, I did the game at the designed pace, the story is 18 hours, I did a third of it in 6 - you cannot buy one thing in the shop with 1/3 of the games length and thats unacceptable.

That is not even beginning to mention the mental games it starts to play with you right from the beginning, it toys with you at the beginning trying to make these ""cool items"" seem easy to get. The game constantly shoves advertising for its in-game shop, slowly wearing you down until you go ""fine, i'll take a look"" just to shut the character up. It is made this way to annoy you enough, to overwhelm you enough, to break through any fortifications you've built up to get you to give in. Everything about this game is designed to push you into that shop. It locks what could be a very good vehicle creator behind tons of gates & hidden stuff because they want you to be frustrated, you don't have every brick you would need right away, you don't have every vehicle base you would need to make something you want to. You can't even make a completely custom vehicle despite the game very much having the capability to do so.

This is the game that defines the state that gaming has become, its no longer about making a good game - now its about taking as much money as possible. Do. Not. Buy.

This game is predatory
This game is abusive
This game is 2K

I love LEGO, I love all sorts of racing games, and have played thousands of hours of them. However, for LEGO 2K DRIVE, 2K tried to take both roads with the pricing model and ended up turning a lot of people away. You either make a game that's $60 with **NO** MICROTRANSACTIONS, or you make a game free-to-play with microtransactions that are cosmetic at most. As they say, you can't have your cake and eat it too.

The game itself is a true blast, it's got a lot going for it. It's like a mix between Forza Horizon and The Crew 2's open world, with the Lego Racers aesthetic, aimed at a younger demographic. The game's story is quite fun for me so far and its car editor/builder is a huge time-waster that works surprisingly well on a controller. It's got a good open world that's fun to explore, it's not as big as I expected it would be but it's big enough to be worthwhile to just drive around in finding collectibles and destroying everything. The big thing holding that aspect back is that they developed this for last-gen consoles (notably Switch) so instead of it being a true, seamless open-world, it's five worlds that are each an area/biome. That's fine, but it makes me wonder what that aspect of the game could've been if it were a seamless open world.

However, for a game aimed at kids, the microtransactions & in-game shop in this game are quite predatory. It takes quite some time to be able to buy ONE vehicle, and honestly you should be able to buy your first microtransaction vehicle by a couple of hours into the game, not take about 20 hours to get a ton of BrikBux before buying your first vehicle. The grind itself doesn't bother me personally, I play a lot of games with it. However, the intention of 2K and Visual Concepts is to make you get frustrated enough while playing the game to just give in and spend more money on a car instead of spending time unlocking it. That is by design, especially as this game is built for and marketed towards children, who naturally have less patience than adults.

In conclusion, the gameplay itself is fun but the business model from 2K and Visual Concepts is not. I'd say I expected better, but in 2023 that would be a lie. It hurts me to not recommend this title because the core gameplay is there, but I cannot in good faith recommend it because of the way its business model preys on children. If you want to buy it, wait until it is on a deep sale, which will probably be pretty quick based on what I have seen of previous 2K first-party titles. At the same time, only buy it and go in knowing that you will be spammed by menus asking you to buy microtransactions, so avoid them at all costs.

PARENTS: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME FOR YOUR KIDS. However, if you feel so strongly that you have to, PLEASE stay in the room with them and supervise them while playing it. THIS GAME'S IN-GAME STORE IS AIMED AT CHILDREN, and they WILL fall for it if they are not careful. I hate that I have to say something like this for a video game, especially one based off of such a fun pastime such as LEGOs, but 2K has forced my hand to have to say something like this.

EDIT 05/30/2023: Just when I thought 2K could not stoop any lower, they do just that. In a recent patch, they fixed a crash that happened when going into Unkie's Emporium. That's the only thing they did. The catch? That's where the cosmetics and microtransaction shop is. The fact that they found it necessary to release an update to fix that and only that in a fully-priced game should tell you all you need to know about 2K and Visual Concepts."

Hey! People working at 2K Games! Are you reading this? Good! The following is just for you.

Lego 2K Drive is a fun game, like a REALLY fun game. Creating your own Lego vehicles and driving around with them in various worlds is great. Give the team at Visual Concepts gold medals for the gameplay design. They made something incredible here.

However, you clearly want this to be a live service, so I will give you some advice. New vehicles and vehicle cosmetics mean NOTHING if the only ways that players can utilize them is by doing the same races they've already done dozens of times and by driving around in the same zones they've already explored. That's not going to interest anyone into a purchase. The things that will engage players in the long-term as well as attract new players are
1: new race courses
2: new explorable zones
3: new unique minigames

NOT the battle passes and NOT new purchasable items in the micro-transaction store.

Many people dislike live service games is because too many publishers and developers have fooled themselves into thinking that adding content to the “store” counts as adding content to the “game.” It doesn’t. Store content only exist as a side offering to the actual playable game content that you need to be adding as well.

You've already turned away a lot of potential players by making this a live service game. But since you're committed to it, make sure that this live service at least benefits customers and players with more things to play, NOT JUST more things to buy. Maybe then it’ll be great and more people will love it. I’m telling you this because Lego 2K Drive is too good of a foundation to ruin by making the same mistakes as far too many other live service games. Use this advice well."

The shady Toy Car Salesman

Inside my Childlike fantasy, I once travelled across the city carpet to the 2K Motors Dealership, looking to acquire a sweet new Toy Car to wreak havoc on many different city carpets with. I knew that a good toy car could theoretically reach the hundreds of Euros Price Range, but I was ready to pay up if the Car delivered.
The salesman, Microel Transanton, was very friendly and seemed just as childlike, as if we were on the same wavelength.
He managed to sell me on a model called LEGO 2K Drive, even got me to waive the ability to return it by offering me a 25% discount on the Key.

I was completely scammed.
Sure, the car controls great, and recklessly driving for hundreds of centimeters while disregarding traffic, public safety and physical laws is great, and it's directly compatible with most PC and Steam Deck Systems out of the box, unlike most prestigious cars these days, but it was nowhere near worth the price.
The customization options are severely limited unless you plug your Credit card right into the dashboard, which completely goes against the Car Brand's ethos of unending imaginative power, and after just a handful of hours, I needed to take it to a mechanic to install new and expensive DLC Parts.

The Junior Recreational Automotive Industry has become a total money-making scheme, completely spitting on its legacy of the legendary LEGO Racers it brought to fame.

This was a literal and (Mini)figurative Highway Robbery."

Well, this one was a trip...

LEGO 2K Drive is (kinda) a spiritual successor to LEGO Racers 2. Note that I specifically said LEGO Racers 2, not LEGO Racers 1. That's because the story mode is an open world racing game with slight RPG elements, just like in LR2. The building system has significantly evolved and I'd argue it's on-par with the now-defunct LEGO Digital Designer in capabilities. Most smaller objects are destructible in typical LEGO game fashion. Character animations are actually designed to resemble stop-motion, which is a nice attention to detail.

There are four world maps, although one of them is just a tutorial area you can revisit. The themes for the other three are: American Southwest Desert in the 60s, Yukon Territory in the late 1800s but with modern infrastructure, and classic pulp horror fantasy. Oh, and then there's an ultramodern sci-fi track with slight Japanese influences, probably as a bit of a homage to Ninjago. Honestly, this could definitely use some variety.

The powerup system is a bit of a half-and-half between LR1 and LR2. While there's no upgrade bricks and many powerup pickups are random, there are also fixed pickups in plenty of different places allowing you to strategically select what powerup you want to use. You can't exchange powerups by running over another pickup, but you do get instant access to your powerup even if it's at random.

The powerups themselves are, honestly, kinda weak for the most part, but honestly with how chaotic this game gets it doesn't need broken powerups. There's a couple powerful ones, like a warp boost or one that makes everyone's wheels square, but they're rare (I've personally never picked them up).

Now, time for the good, the bad and the ugly. Oh boy, this one's a particularly interesting one.

The good:
The game has an impressive attention to detail. The devs went above and beyond with the animation and building systems, they could have just made this solely focused around prebuilt cars and used similar animations to previous LEGO games both during the TT era and before it.
The physics are pretty tight for the most part. There's a bit of jank in some places and you will run into it, but the general driving model is pretty spot-on for a kart racer.

The bad:
The PC version specifically feels like a hastily made cash grab port, but at the same time apparently the console versions have keyboard and mouse support so I can't really tell which version is the original. I can say that keyboard and mouse support is a bit janky even in the PC version .
This game has some nasty rubberbanding, and while it needs at least some simply because the AI drives like a drunk donkey, the shear amount of it gets annoying. And it gets doubly bad after a while if you have difficulty assist turned on, which tightens up the AI's driving a bit but mostly just ramps up the rubber banding even more. The result is that this game has a significant amount of fake difficulty of the ""player's input doesn't matter"" type, and races can often come down to simply not getting hit by a spider on the final stretch.
You're limited to 50 custom vehicles even on the PC version. This is a massive step backwards as both LR1 and LR2 allowed an infinite number of custom vehicles on PC.

The ugly:
Oh god, where to begin. You know, I'm personally not actually that bothered by the monetization system, but that's because I mainly focus on custom builds and only buy flairs and vehicles as needed, and everything can be bought with in-game currency earned from gameplay alone. The only things that are must-buys for me are brick packs and those are cheap. But holy studs on a brick, who the 1x1 modified brick with one side stud thought that having both a full-release price tag AND F2P-like microtransactions on the same game? Again, you can get around it since the microtransaction system is just ""pay to skip the grind"", but for anyone who wants to collect all the prebuilt vehicles, you're either going to have to grind like crazy or cough up real-world cash.

Summary: A love letter to LEGO wrapped in the crap-colored wrapping paper of greedy business practices with a ribbon of poor quality control on top. But at least you're allowed to tear the wrapping paper off if you want.

167 hours to get a DLC Car

Won my first multiplayer online race on Xbox which paid out 5 brickbux. Some of the cars cost around 10,000 brickbux. I estimate with loading a new match, filling lobbies, and finishing the race at a generous 5 minutes per race.

This means you'd need to win (not just complete) 2000 races, which at 5 minutes per race you'll complete in about 167 hours to get that 10k DLC car.

Needless to say I refunded the game. I can't imagine how anyone can find this anything but predatory.

I understand you get decent payouts for single player events, but that's only on the first time you complete the event. Payouts for subsequent completions of the same event are far less.

Also, no cross-progression. I started out on Xbox and thought PC might be more enjoyable with small sessions on the Steam Deck. This means you'd need to buy battlepass, all DLC, and complete all the content again.

Game is also running awfully on my i7-11700k and 3080 with 64 GB RAM. No excuse, and my utilization never went above 13 percent in with processor, memory, or video."

This game had a lot of potential but is extremely restrictive in regards to what you can actually build.

The preset chassis you have to use and the lack of many types of brick really make it hard to recreate IRL sets.

The games base is pretty solid, but the fact you're being charged anything up to £104.99 (starting at £49.99 for the base game) and on top of that there's micro transactions and a season pass, just feels like you're being taken for a ride.

This game's got microtransactions out the ass when the game's already 60 dollars. It's got a season pass that's an extra 40 dollars. The game ACTIVELY ENCOURAGES YOU to buy premium in-game currency every thirty minutes, which I found really scummy and predatory.

And it's running Denuvo DRM, which is really just the cherry on top of this poop sundae.

Great building. Fun gameplay, actually. Great graphics.

But the way this game is monetized is ridiculous, and I refunded it within the hour after realizing exactly how much crap 2k decided to lock behind paywalls and predatory practices.

Also, Denuvo.

Would I recommend picking this game up on sale, even? Maybe? I'm probably going to, I legitimately had fun with the builder. But not enough to justify a 60 dollar sticker price, with additional microtransactions and freemium garbage on top of that price. Nuh-uh. Either charge 60 dollars, or make the game free with microtransactions. Can't have it both ways."

Skip this game unless you are sure you want to spent 60 bucks or more for a game that should've been 20 bucks or 30 if it would have some licensed cars in it...
The game offers about 18 hours of gameplay regarding the races and the majority of on the go events. Beyond that its only collectibles. Its still 18 hours of fun if you can get over the fact of the horrible rubber banding which removes player skill completely and punishes you if you make a mistake near the end of a race but besides that its just building cars that is fun.

Just for the price tag alone its a big yikes to buy this game. Looking into the game, you can see that it will become a ""live service game"". You cant even get ""all"" bricks to build whatever you want. Usually you have to mangle a prebuilt car to get that ONE brick you cant get.
Another huge issue is the constant usage of the ""Woodchipper 5000"" which is the only car that can cut down grass. Have fun never using another off road car since you might aswell encounter a random patch of weed somewhere....

tl;dr
Rubberbanding bad, story lasts 15 h or less if you dont complete all races on all difficulties, NPCs remind you every 30 minutes that you should buy microtransactions cosmetics, you cant buy / obtain all bricks in the game"

The core gameplay is Lego Racers, and it's great. Cars feel good and handle well.

But I can't play this game without getting angry due to greedy practices.

There's so many design decisions that are actively hostile to the consumer:
- player 2 in co-op can't use downloaded or custom vehicles, which defeats the point of a creative game
- the drive pass adds no new content. I already beat the game so I literally can't level up.
- the store costs too much per car and it's impossible to make money quickly"

I'm echoing the sentiment that 2K is a scummy company and that the MTX is poorly implemented, and none of the vehicles really look all that worth it.

Having said that, if you've already bought the game, and would rather have nicer looking vehicles you can use for free, I'd recommend going to the Lego website and downloading the build instructions PDF's there to build your own stuff. You might have to get clever, though, as the game won't give you every frame to start with like the instructions state, but I'd recommend that instead of giving 2K more money than they frankly deserve.

Gameplay is fun and the world is charming and colorful. But for Christ's sake, 2K, it's a kid's game. I understand you need to make profit, and you could just do the season pass ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and be done with it, but instead you need to lock things behind paywalls for... What reason? Just to squeeze a little extra out?

Scummy. Plain and simple."

Pros:
Vehicle Creation. The brick selection is good (but not perfect) and many of the bricks function properly. You can choose from many Lego colors including transparents and metalics, but you can also make bricks glow. You are not forced to include the driver minifig and can make micro vehicles or ones without interiors. There's a large selection of technic and hinged pieces. Being able to manually angle bricks is also a great addition.
There is a very large selection of engine sounds to properly portray your creation. The most fun I have had is building both real sets but also crazy things like Mame Bus from Tamagotchi.

The Gameplay. Similar to Lego Racers 2, Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed, and Forza Horizon. There is not only racing but also hub worlds with events and trials in the enviroment. There are many collectables in the different hub worlds which unlock different things such as minifigs, engine sounds, or bricks. You can actually attempt every challenge with any vehicle you are using unless it's, for example, a boat specific event.

There's a decent variety of missions and quests to play. You can try for gold time on a hill climb or smash mushrooms in the time limit between races. Mowing weeds actually affects your races because they are replaced with boost fuel when you clear them. I enjoyed the events more than Horizon 5's class locked events or trials with players ramming. Each hub world has its own mini-biomes and each area has its own set of collectibles. The bat collectibles are usually in the air, while the treasure chests require dolphins to dive and get them for you.

Despite most of the races taking place in the hub worlds, the tracks you race on are changed slightly. The variations take into account your chosen class but also change time of day and weather. The ability to fully jump on demand is interesting and adds depth to combat.

The graphics look great on everything, although less decent on some of the enviroment. Having the studs properly rendered through transparent pieces, different finishes on the bricks, and glow bricks lighting up is great. There are a few specific places in the hub worlds that could look better. Seeing all of the Lego sets is cool and the ability to destroy almost anything on the track is satisfying as well.

You are only given 6 chassis for street, 5 chassis for off-road, and 5 chassis for water. You are forced to build off of these chassis and you cannot edit the pre-placed bricks or axle locations. There are other chassis specifically made for the developer and Lego vehicles you unlock, which can be used as a ""psuedo base"" if you clear the bricks that it allows you to. A majority of the vehicles actually seen in the game driven by NPC or AI drivers can't actually be created by the player due to both the chassis system but also many bricks not even being available to players. If the vehicle you want to make doesn't follow the very specific chassis layout the game allows, then you can't make it. Not a single 90's or early 2000's Lego jetski or boat is possible without major redesigning.

This artifical restriction is done intentionally so that players are forced to buy more vehicles to increase their usable chassis pool. Both of the basic 6 wide Speed Champions chassis have pre-placed bricks and moved axles so you can't even make most official sets without redesigning them. Even incredibly basic Lego Racers 1 cars can't be properly remade because of this asinine system.

You are given a few premade minifigs to play as but you cannot create your own. You unlock more minifigs as you complete races and challenges... or you can buy more in the store. You cannot edit them in any way. The amount of minifigs is incredibly limited even after unlocking or purchasing them all. There are no classic minifigs playable. (other than the redesigned Rocket Racer)
Once again this artificial restriction is in place to force players into buying a minifig they want in the store. Even Lego Racers 1 let you create your own minifig. These restrictions are honestly unacceptable in a full price game.
I would also like to specifically mention an issue I have had. When playing certain minifigs in certain vehicles the game will remove their headgear and replace it with a standard racing helmet. I'm assuming this is to prevent clipping however the race helmet already clips and removing the fire fighting helmet from my fire fighting minifig that I bought is incredibly stupid, especially when the vehicle is open top.

The AI rubberbands aggressively. For comparison, it is almost as bad as Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed. Even with a full top speed and boost power build (never stop boosting once) the AI in 2nd and 3rd will keep some pace with you. In this situation I actually found the lower difficulty harder than the higher difficulty as I can no longer run perks to compensate against the AI. The AI have infinite boost but will slam the brakes if you get hit or they lead by too much. They will violently push you out of the way if you sit on their line, similar to Horizon 5 AI. The Sky Cup Grand Prix race is probably the strongest example. The rubber banding is so bad especially during the final turn that it's almost comical. The AI drive poorly and will fly off the track only to respawn in 1 second on top of you and violently send you off the map.

The music in Lego 2K Drive is mediocre. None of the music is ""bad"" but compared to the incredibly iconic Lego Racers 1 soundtrack, there is little competition. The two best songs in Lego 2K Drive are the stock disco and halloween music played from the boomboxes in the hub worlds. While driving through Hauntsborough, I often found myself ignoring the game's music and playing the ""Halloween World"" theme from Sim Theme Park in my head... The first 3 notes of Big Butte County's theme sounds like Elinu's Dance from Tera Online and I'm briefly jumpscared by great music.

Lego Racers 1 and Lego Racers 2 both include a minifig editor, and virtually every other Lego game has a significantly better roster of premade minifigs to choose from.

The items/powerups are standard for the genre, but nothing great like Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed. For those that haven't played that game, virtually every offensive item can be avoided if you're skilled enough. Lego 2K Drive specifically includes the ability to dodge missile, but you can dodge other items and hazards by jumping. I wish the system was closer to Sonic.

Once again I would have enjoyed a system like Sonic's or even Mario Kart Wii. Hitting jumps during a race just makes me want to land sooner. A similar issue is found with Mario Kart 7 and 8's boring gliders.

At the price they are asking I would love to see something like ModNation Racer's editor but I would at the very least expect something as basic as Forza Horizon's eventlabs.

While Sonic's boat sections were at the mercy of a water physics demon, the flight sections were actually great. In Lego 2K Drive there are tons of official Lego sets landed or flying around the hub worlds but players are stuck with car, car, and boat.

I enjoy the hubs included in the game but a complete lack of Pirate, Arctic, and Medieval is ridiculous. Life on Mars and Mars Mission have a few cameos, but space isn't properly represented either. Lego Racers 1 and 2 both handled this better. Not even a Rock Raiders cameo in Prospecto Valley. I'm going to assume they're holding these themes for later updates.

I enjoyed the game despite the flaws, but I highly recommend waiting for a sale."

Great game but terrible rubber-banding destroys the entire experience. If you do not care for rubber-banding then go ahead and buy it.
Also for those who do not know, rubber-banding is basically a way to make a race feel always close, if you drive slow or crash and fall behind, the AI will drive slower so you can catch up, and if you drive perfectly and get ahead, the AI will speed up.
Every race in this game feels super close and you always win or lose by a single second or at most a few seconds. Each race comes down to the last turn. At first I thought it was thanks to their super advanced difficulty technology, which allowed the AI to be just as good as myself. Yes, you heard me, there is no difficulty option in the game but rather and option auto selected that adjusts the game difficulty based on your performance. In reality that is just a fake option in order to make you think each race is close because of the adjusting difficulty, but they really just slapped a rubber-banding code and a fake difficulty option and called it a day. I tested the game with this option toggled on and off, and there is absolutely no difference in difficulty or AI racers times. The only thing that effects the speed of the AI is your own speed. If you crash a million times and never use boosts and drive slow, guess what? The race will be super close right until the finish line. You can drive perfectly with insane shortcut skips and boost perfectly and drift perfectly and then fumble in the last 100m and lose the raise. Or that very same race, you can crash a million times and win. I have tested this on many modes and races and with both the adjustable difficulty toggled on and off, and its the same. I can drive super fast and the AI will be 1 second behind me or I can drive 30 entire seconds slower and the AI will be 30 seconds slower. This means that the only thing that matters is the last 100m. Jut save all your boost and an item for the end of the race and use it and you will never lose, ever. Once I found that out, it ruined the entire game for me because now I know it doesn't matter at all how I drive throughout the entire race, I just save my boost and win at the end. I went from driving perfectly and sweating these close races to barely paying attention to the game and winning at the end with boost.
I figured out that the game was using rubber-banding because I would sometimes lose a race in which I drove perfectly but slightly messed up at the very end of the race and then replayed the race and crashed a million times throughout the race and ended up winning that very same race I had lost. This and the fact that every race felt super close right until the end, prompted me to start testing the game to see if there was rubber-banding.
If they added difficulty options like easy,medium, and hard, and removed rubber-banding, this would be an instant recommend. The game is great aside from that, but that issue really plagues the entire experience."

i know my reviews are usually satire, but i'm gonna be serious for once. i know you've seen other people describe 2k as 'scummy' and the microtransactions as 'predatory' and they'd be absolutely right. the game itself is fun, don't get me wrong, but the amount of paid items in this, plus the fact that getting large amounts of brickbux takes a very long time, essentially forcing people with low patience or attention spans - which is the age group this game is targeted at - to buy brickbux is just horrible. it's good if you ignore the microtransactions, but if you're a parent looking at this game after your child asked if they could get it, put some kind of measure on your credit card or whatever you use to pay for stuff on steam that asks for your password or pin number before you make the purchase."

Like so many other people downvoting this, i really enjoyed the game: its clean, looks good, and plays well with minimal bugs (at least for me). But while the micro-transactions werent so apparent to me as I played the single player campaign, due to the flow of cash for the store from the races, as soon I completed it and the river dries up almost completely (replaying races has lower return than first play through) you really notice them and how pricey everything is.

Come on, 2K, this is a game clearly targeted at a young audience (plus AFOL's). Go exploit some other age group, capable of spending their own money (middle age NFL2K fans for example)! Or, and here's a clever thought that might limit some of the backlash, don't go charging a premium for a game where you're going to be making bank through in-game purchases.

Will i still continue to play this game, yes. Lets be honest probably even more once cloud saves are fixed so i can switch between deck and desktop.

The driving is adequate, but the free-form building feels clunky. There are also parts missing that I would have expected to be there, those being from the LEGO Speed Champions line. Undoubtedly to be released as DLC later on...

The biggest issue is the monetization. Buying the base game will cost you the standard 60 bucks (thankfully ONLY 60 bucks, considering some devs have stepped up to 70 bucks for base...).
Then there's the season pass. You've hit 100 bucks there.
And THEN there's the microtransactions. Yes, yes. They're optional. But, with everything ""optional"" in gaming, if it were that easy to ignore they wouldn't have added it.
There are frequent enough reminders that you should spend the Bux (ingame currency). And from there less-frequent, but still there, reminders that you can buy those Bux.
And with the ingame store being horribly expensive... no.

I've asked for a refund.

Purely from a racing perspective, it's adequately competent though nothing special. It's a mechanical iteration on Burnout. It does what Burnout does, but without spirit.
Purely from a creative building perspective, it falls short. The building is just awkward enough to detract from having fun."

It's alright but asking $60 for this is a stretch.

Good:
Doesn't require a 3rd party launcher or leave a process running after quitting the game
Good performance, not a buggy mess
Runs perfectly on Linux
Local splitscreen
Lego

Bad:
Multiplayer requires creating and linking a 2K Account
Excessive DLC and microtransactions (although not having a 2K account prevents you from buying much)
The highest framerate cap is 120 FPS even though the game could run much faster
Can't create a custom minifigure? This seems like a super weird omission so I'm genuinely not sure if I just missed the option, or if it's something to unlock later on...
Singleplayer seems pretty short

The vehicle physics are heavy and clunky and just not very fun to drive, although the ability to jump, drift, and boost makes up for it somewhat. There's also an upgrade system and the ability to tweak some stats, so it could be that late game physics feel much better than the early game physics. I wasn't really feeling it so I've requested a refund.

It's not completely terrible or anything, just a little bland. Kinda bummed that this is the closest thing we'll get to a third Lego Racers game.

I don't recommend buying it at full price. Knowing 2K the game will likely go on sale for extremely cheap next year in order to bring fresh players into their cash shop and boost their quarterly earnings, I'd just wait until then."

Honestly this is almost a great game. Making your own vehicle has so much depth that is locked behind monetization.

Rather than having everything possible for making your own vehicle, unlocking more customization is split up between in-game challenges from races(which is fine), purchasing more customization from the store(which some have been in the rotating shop instead of the permanent shop), and grinding the incredibly grindy battle pass. I'm hoping at some point this game let's players share vehicles with each other, but that would undermine the unnecessary cash shop.

I have been playing mainly on the steam deck with CryoUtilities, the game runs fine for the most part, but during races there can be some performance issues.

The monetization of the game is obscene. $60 game with a collection of ""drive passes"" and a rotating cash shop on top of that? You can argue that you can actually earn the currency in the game at least for the cash shop, but you earn such small amounts since after completing a race or challenge after the first time rewards MUCH less.

I wouldn't even be opposed to the drive if it was for JUST bringing in licensed content or real world vehicles. The first drive pass at least has this somewhat right, although undermined by the fact you are still unlocking basic lego build packs and little unlocks. It wouldn't even have to be Star Wars, Marvel, or DC. Lego has a rich history of their own properties, Ninjago and Monkie Kid would be welcome.

Honestly I hope the rest of the ""season pass"" brings more to the table, new race tracks would add so much more replayabillity to this game."

While I enjoyed my time with the game and played through it rather quickly, I can't recommend this game.

If you are a huge fan of the old Lego Racer games and just love building cars you might enjoy Lego 2K Drive. The open world can be fun to drive around and explore. There are various challenges to mix up the game play and keep things interesting. As far as the story goes, if you have played Lego games in the past it feels about the same along with the humor. Building cars feels great, I spent a good amount of my playtime in the garage making Lego cars I had as a child or trying to recreate real life cars that I love.

The reason I can't recommend this game is I don't see this game having much of a life span. For one the racing itself can feel pretty awful at times. The AI rubber bands like crazy, but it does go both ways I suppose... Falling behind or getting ahead does not really mean anything in this game. The Item pick ups are pretty standard which is fine but a lot less creative then Lego Racers. Many of the tracks feel very much the same. I loved the tracks that were a sprint to the finish line rather than just doing short laps on the same track 3-6 times, but there are only a handful of the sprint courses.

Second, its a live service game. Personally I don't think that HAS to be a bad thing, but in this case it is. You earn a currency in this game that you can pay for but you can also earn it by playing the game. Playing through the story I ended up with about 70k, that seems like a nice amount but that's only because you get a huge bonus the first time you beat each race on each difficulty in story mode. After that the income is much weaker. Most shop items cost between 4k-20k. So maybe grinding out money in multiplayer would be a better option, since that way it would keep people playing online and keeping the game alive right?

NOPE.

I played 10 online races. In total from those races I earned 37$ (And that's from winning most of the races.). That took a little over an hour probably. Already the game feels dead. The biggest my lobby got was 6/8 Players, most of the time though it was about 3 of us. I can't blame people for not wanting to play online, since you will have to work days to be able to afford anything in the shop. I feel like this is a huge oversight... But how was that missed? How do you think 5$ is a good reward for first place? Because of this, everything in the shop feels overpriced. Again, I don't think Live Services NEED to be bad, but whoever came up with this model disagrees with me.

If they do an update that makes multiplayer worthwhile they could potentially have a player base, but as it stands I can't see them making content for this game past the first seasons pass's date. (If they even go that long.) In the shop it looks like they are planning for multiple season passes. I just don't see how that's possible.

UPDATE: As of 5/24/2023 You now earn the same amount of currency in the multiplayer that you would in single player. This is an improvement, but I still feel that the online play should reward MORE than the single player to encourage online play."

TL;DR - Fun racer, needs some balancing, little buggy gameplay, decent builder, IN-GAME CURRENCY GOES *POOF*, buy on steep sale.

I was so ready for a Lego Racers successor, but there are some shortcomings that I can't gloss over.

The game play is fun. You won't be disappointed with the general racing. As you unlock the higher racing classes (B & A) you may find that the boost mechanics get out of hand with several tracks supporting infinite boosting. To me this warrants adding a ""blue-shell"" and/or re-balancing the boost system.

There are some funky launching physics when crashing at high speeds, especially in water areas. Also on water, you can lose all forward thrust when holding the pedal down in sharp turns. Boosting can't remedy this. You have to release the gas a moment for it to kick back on.

I've spent a lot of time in the builder, and it works fairly well though I'd love an option to lock the camera in place.

The ""Brick-bucks"" have issues. I don't give a hoot about the micro transaction system. In this day and age, I was just glad to see that no items would be truly held hostage behind a pay wall. I'm happy to grind out some currency for the extra brick packs and few other items I buy. HOWEVER, I take exception to having large sums (>10k) of earned currency vanish between game sessions. Multiple instances of this issue prompted this review.

I really wanted to like this game. :/

This would be fine if when you unlocked a new vehicle, you unlocked a new frame to work with, but the most the game is willing to compromise is letting you strip a frame of most of its components, just not all of them, like say, the biggest, most obtrusive pieces that make the frame impossible to build something original with. Your Burger Kart will ALWAYS have the bottom bun. this is NON NEGOTIABLE. If a BOTTOM BUN can serve as the foundation for any sandwich, it can serve as the foundation for your Lego AMOGUS.
There are three and a quarter maps. The quarter is the starting map, the smallest, dinkiest map, and the other three are decently sized, they offer fun racing environments, but given their size, the price of the game, the brands associated, and the money they're continually asking for, it's a pitiful amount of content. They're not even made of Lego, not consistently, at least, they're bog-standard 3d environments which facilitates the construction of more tracks, but there's only ~30 tracks, and 24 of those are Forza Horizon-esque circuits and routes on the open world maps. The 5 cup races are completely original tracks. This isn't to say the non-cup tracks arent fun, they are, that's the game's saving grace aside from the (arbitrarily limited) building, in tandem with the fun, arcadey racing.
Wait until the Game releases it's battle pass. There's supposedly something in there, maybe the game's pitiful rewards system is due to the rewards being arbitrarily ripped out of the core gameplay loops to be sold off at a later date. I'd say it's nice that the Battlepass is going to be evergreen content, meaning there's no FOMO for that aspect, but the in-game store features a weekly rotating set of items that will never return until some nebulous date in the far flung future without warning. If the first update doesn't bring any meaningful content or system updates, then don't bother. If this game makes a change for the better, wait for it to be at least 30% off, $40 would be far more appropriate for what feels like a middle-budget arcade racer.
I think a good way to sum up a review for this game would be to assess the multiplayer offerings. As it stands; online lobbies are sparse. Barren. That's due to a multitude of factors. First, the rewards for racing online are non-existent. There's no incentive to compete in more difficult races for less rewards, there's no ranking system, no levels, no challenges, no prizes, there is ZERO incentive. Second, The online infrastructure is BROKEN. There's no lobby browser, meaning you're constantly dropped into lobbies with 1~3 other players who will likely disconnect as you're connecting, often times in the middle of a race, right on top of another Player or Bot. You'll be stuck on a loading screen while the Race begins, and will only be allowed to participate when the race is halfway through its second lap, and you're just sat at the starting line. Third, the failure spiral. When a game doesn't get traction quickly, it's unlikely it will ever find its footing. People who were suckered into buying this product will go online and find lobbies populated by one or three other people, and they will never see a full lobby. they will assume that trying to find a match online is futile, and will find other avenues to try and enjoy the game, or they will find a different game to play altogether. They will go online, onto forums or the Steam Reviews, and shout from the rooftops that this game is ""dead on arrival,"" to dissuade other consumers from repeating their mistakes. 2K dropped the ball with this one. I'd like to update this review in the future but I am highly doubtful I'll be given a reason to do so."

I really wanted to like this game, but it's totally ruined by pushing way too many microtransactions.

Example 1: To get new building blocks
1) Buy a new pre-made car model with in-game currency
2) Build the bought car in the editor step-by-step without skipping any parts (this is pretty tedious)
3) Congrats, you can now spend (in-game) money to buy the new parts

Building your own cars and driving around the open world is still really fun for any Lego fans, but I can't overall recommend this game."

Do NOT BUY !!! Here are couple things which are absolutely infuriating.
1. There is no RESTART OPTION after you finished a race... You have to load back into the map and start the race over from there... Do that 10 times in the row and you been on a loading screen for 7 minutes...
2. You cant strip any cars ( bought in the store or won in the story mode ) down to their empty frame... There are always some absolutely useless bricks left here and there... Why cant i just build a new project from the ground up on some of the cooler frames not only on the pre-made ones ???
3. You get 125 Bucks for repeating a race if you win... A car in the shop cost around 10000 Bucks... Simple math. : You have to race and win 80 times to buy a car... Who gonna do that ??? Because of the developers greed this game gonna be dead pretty soon..."

First Of Let Me Start By Saying That This Game Is Super Fun And Is A Great Game. The Reason For The Bad Review Is The Games Monetisation. Not Only Is The Base Game Double What I Would Consider Reasonable For Any Game But The Other Editions Are Also A Ridiculous Price. Then Add Expensive DLC On Top Of That. Plus Don't Forget About The Micro Transactions. And Remember This Is All In A Game Aimed At Kids. This Is Completely Unacceptable And LEGO Needs To Put A Stop To This Scam.

Although If You Are Very Rich Or Have Just Won The Lotto Or Something Then Go For It. It Is Really Fun.
And The Only Reason I Bought It Is Because I Have Zero Impulse Control.
I Got This During Steam Summer Sale 2023 And Even Then It Was Only On 20% Off. This Needs To Be At Least 50% For A Game With This Price Tag.

LEGO 2K Drive is a great game.

I was very personally excited for LEGO 2K Drive as I have always been into cars, racing games, and LEGO nearly my whole life - so this game seemed like it was made for me. It does nearly everything right. Even under the LEGO skin, the driving physics & handling is great, and the way the open world is executed is top-notch. It's the game that has come closest to the Burnout Paradise since 2008. The building system feels natural and intuitive, which is difficult to execute. There's a couple issues with it, such as some bricks only being a part of car presets that you have to modify or some baseplate options lacking - but overall, the editor is amazingly well done. I'm a big fan of the tone of the game, too. LEGO City Undercover no doubt has better writing, but the overall feel of the game feels much in line with what you would expect. It's a feel-good experience with a couple of genuinely funny, self-aware lines.

So why can't I recommend it - at least for now?

I feel like this game got everything right, only for 2K's own greed to mess up a few areas of the game. I shouldn't feel FOMO for not grinding the game to get the ice cream truck before it leaves the shop in four days. I should not only win 25 in-game credits for winning an online race. This is a $60 ($70 if you're on 9th gen consoles, and more if you bought the deluxe versions) that is treated like a F2P game as soon as you enter the shop. I would feel ripped off if I didn't get this with a $100 Steam gift card I got for free with my new graphics card. It isn't acceptable, and that's why I cannot recommend it for now. It's so sad that every time this game will be brought up we will think ""oh yeah, that game was great, sad that it was messed with by 2K"", It's really good, and to see something designed so well get slapped in the face by greed is such a shame. I hope the numbers get adjusted, and the shop rotation just goes away. Even if you love the game like I do, please don't recommend this on Steam so we can lower the rating - and then, maybe 2K, or LEGO, will listen."

I knew i shouldn't have bought this game. I loved the Lego games as a kid, Lego Racers 1/2, Lego Island 1/2, Lego Rock Raiders, all those classic games. And i was really excited to see that we would finally get a new Lego game without a franchise attached to it. A quasi sequel to Lego Racers no less!

But...after playing the game for about an hour and a half i just couldn't get myself to continue. It feels exactly how i feared it would: Like a facade. A facade to feign child-friendliness while they're actually just out to get your money. I just can not shake this feeling of disappointment and anger and how it completely goes against how i want to see Lego. My favorite childhood toy maker just proved they don't care about kids at all. I hate it. I hate how much this ruins the brand for me. I hate how it ruins the game. I'm sorry for everyone who worked on this game and wanted to simply create a fun experience, who put their passion into this game. Because the passion definitely shows. But it's all just overshadowed by predatory monetization schemes for me.

Don't buy this game. Or better yet, buy it, leave a negative review and then refund it. This is not acceptable."
lego+2k+drive,Not Recommended,221.2,"Posted: May 29
I cannot recommend this game. For those who are looking at my steadily growing hours of playing, allow me to explain. However, if you're just looking for the TL;DR, here it is:
The game appeals strongly to a very specific type of player, but has such predatory Micro-transactions that I CANNOT recommend it. Hell, I'd have trouble recommending it if the base game was free.

Okay, with that out of the way, here's a more in depth breakdown of my opinion:

First, you're noticing that I have a lot of hours, still growing, and I haven't refunded this product, even after calling out the bad stuff. There's a reason for this. This game strongly appeals to the sort of person I am. The kid who grew up playing with and building random stuff with boxes full of assorted Lego bricks. The sort of person who gets lost in character creator for hours as I try to tweak it exactly the way I want. The sort of person who happily gets lost for hours, days, even weeks in open world games while ignoring the main quest as much as possible. This is the sort of person I am. If this also describes you, then you might (emphasis on MIGHT) enjoy this game too. So the game will strongly appeal to a narrow slice of gamers, of which I happen to be a member of. The sort of person whose first action on booting up the game that first time, was not to enter the world and start racing, but to enter the creator to bang out those tutorials and start tinkering with my first project. Only after seven attempts, at least three of them suitable to use in the open world, did I even look at the other game modes and start banging my way through them. That was admittedly 2 days after I first started. The purchase was... mostly worthwhile for me.

But let's talk about why I am warning everyone, even those like me, away from this game: Micro-transactions of the predatory kind. This game isn't just predatory, it's just this side of Korean/Chinese MMO/Diablo Immortal levels of predatory. To explain: You earn ""BrickBux"" in game at a very slight pace. It SEEMS good, until you realize that in order to 'buy' more bricks for creator mode, it takes 4,000 BrickBux. Yep, 4K for just 3 to 6 new brick types to use in creator mode. This is to say nothing about the vehicles you can buy, which include new stats you can use (for a BrickBux fee) and body types you literally cannot make in creator mode, often with parts you don't have access to (not event to purchase). These new vehicles start around 10,000 BrickBux, and go up depending on artificial rarity with the highest I've see at 14,000. It has Bundles, usually consisting of a car and driver with some other odds and ends, but can come with less or more, that have prices covering a wide gamut, but some at the 100,000 mark and even higher. Yep, they added a rarity system to all this. And in game, you earn these Brickbux at a few hundred for events, maybe 1k (if you're lucky) for 1st in a race, and in the single digits as you wander the map and do things, which makes the act of unlocking anything extremely tedious. Of course what they want you to do is to pay real money for ""Coins"", and then exchange said coins for BrickBux, so you can afford these shiny things. This is an extremely scummy practice that has unfortunately been proven to work, because it hides the actual cost of the purchase by obfuscating it behind a secondary currency. And this is just the start of the predation. Let's not forget that if you buy the deluxe version, you get access to the first 4 packs... these are literally battle pass packs (which haven't been released at time of writing). So it's not DLC, they're selling you the 'chance' to 'earn' new stuff, and of course spend more BrickBux. Oh, and let's not forget the cycling store with a variety of timers bringing things in and out to encourage that FOMO as well. Gotta layer on all the BS freemium strategies, don't we? There's more I am sure I'm forgetting, but these are what stood out the most to me.

So yeah, that's my opinion of the game. I hate that it appeals so strongly to me. It has things I dearly love in it, but surrounded it by the most predatory, customer hateful (not unfriendly, this is downright spiteful of it's customers) practices I've seen outside of a free phone game. The only way it could have been worse was to add multiple currencies with specific unlocks, but I wouldn't put it past 2K to add that down the line. What's sad is you can see the love and attention the makers of the game put into it. You can see their original intent too, to make those BrickBux easy to acquire to unlock new stuff as you went at a reasonable pace. But then the accountants swooped in and messed with the economy until it became the dumpster fire that it is. I hate that I love this game, but this is a case of please do as I say, not as I do. I recognize the horrible predatory nature, and have chosen to do my best to avoid it so I can enjoy the game for what it is. But even I realize I'm going to slip. For instance, don't bother with the starter pack, it's useless. I paid the $5 for it and feel ripped off because of it. Unless you have the stomach for the battle pass system, don't bother with the deluxe edition, the vehicles it provides ain't worth it.

Just don't do as I do. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME until it's at least %50 off, if not more. 2K doesn't deserve to charge full price for this predatory skinner-box construct it made. Let it shamble itself into the grave, and maybe we can get a real Lego game without this BS monetization. I'm not holding my breath tho.

(( edit note: Minor edit made for accuracy. The price of Vehicles are 10-14K, I misattributed the higher ""bundle"" prices as part of their cost. I've split that up for better clarity. ))"

Just another reason why I shouldn't let nostalgia drive my purchasing decisions. Forza Horizon 4 did LEGO so much better even with everything it was missing. Here's all the bad stuff up front.

-Micro Transactions
-After completing story you will only be able to purchase about 4 vehicles. Everything else will need to be a grind to unlock or purchase with real currency.
-Bricks for building also need to be purchased.
-Physics
-This is more a preference but I wasn't a fan of the physics, I didn't find the controls intuitive at all. The game uses the typical brake to drift mechanic. Cars oversteer even at the slowest speed so the handbrake is needed for tight turns. When drifting if you let go of the gas at all the drift stops so you can't feather the gas. There is also a jump button that is required a lot. Had they just fixed the oversteering problem they probably could have gotten rid of the handbrake.
-Building cars is limited, many bricks are locked behind a paywall and the default bases don't seem to be standard. Also a lot of classic pieces that are meant for cars are missing.
-No four player Split-Screen
-So sick of battle passes and service games. This game is full price so passes and Micro Transactions shouldn't be required for the content. I think for most people this games pricing far outweighs it's worth.
-Rubber Banding/catchup is awful. Seems this can be turned off a little with one of the options but I saw no difference. The rubber banding is trash and most of my races came down to rubber banding luck at the end. This completely ruins the feeling of having any skill. I know that this is meant for all skill levels but find a better way.

As far as positive points go the game is lacking because everything gets overshadowed by the bad. I only had a few bugs during my playtime and it works ok on the Steam Deck as well. The atmosphere is pretty cools and some of the LEGO jokes are funny. The Story itself isn't anything special but is funny at times. The maps are great too. For a Full price game though this should include so much more. At the time of this review I'm at about 16 hours in the game and find it hard to turn back on.

Overall if money is no object and you're fine with micro transactions and all the other nonsense in these types of games then have at it but even then it feels like a shell. LEGO could have done so much better."

Visual Concepts makes a really fun arcade racer.

2K's greedy hands makes the game grindy to encourage microtransactions purchases, on top of a bunch of planned DLC.

LEGO 2K Drive doesn't seem to sell that well due to people not wanting to pay full price for a game with abhorrent monetization.

So I like the game and I will give it a thumbs up. The people who gave it a thumbs down for micro transactions are not wrong. It is horrible 2K put this in the game with a heavy price for an already full purchase price game. Especially when kids are the target audience. It should be noted, even though there are micro transactions, I find them completely unnecessary for playing the game. Here is why.

1) The races aren't too hard. They can be challenging at times, but you don't need to buy a better car to beat them. What you unlock throughout the game is good enough.

2) If you find yourself needing an upgrade, it's better to build/modify a car. The best thing to spend cash on in my opinion is the vehicle stats in the customization menu. These can be unlocked throughout the game by doing races and side quests. You can also modify current vehicles with better stats, making a lot of the cars basically cosmetic.

3) Cars can be unlocked throughout the game as well. Do not neglect side quests. They give excellent rewards, cash, and experience. If you see a new side quest, do it. It is worth the time.

Because of what can be unlocked by just playing the game, micro transactions seem mostly cosmetic. But I agree, the fact they exist in the first place is horrible. Achievements would have been a much cooler system for unlocking certain racers/vehicles/brick packs.

As far as game play, I really enjoy it. It is relaxing to just drive around and do quests. The story has made me laugh from time to time. It is a really fun racing and rpg game. Racing feels really smooth, variety of options for different racing load outs, and an overall balanced feel. It is also enjoyable to build a car, being creative and trying out different looks is a lot of fun. I feel that is what Lego should be. It is worth the money. Just don't allow yourself or your kids to fall for the horrible micro transaction scam."

From my experience with the full release and the beta...

Overview

+ A lot of Destruction!
+ Lego Editor is fun
+ Performance is good
+ Very few Bugs

- Extremely Repetetive
- Rubberbanding/Cheating AI
- Race Rewards are terrible
- No sense of Progression
- The Open World is tiny
- Very Short and boring Campaign
- Story Progression is gated behind the player level
- Overall there is way too little content in the game



So in my playtime on the live serves I got myself 4 Vehicles out of the Store, all with in-game earned bucks. But all of that money comes from the first completion bonus you receive. After that, you need to grind very boring activities for tiny rewards for hours on end. If you purchase a car in the store you also receive the stat-kit it comes with, which you then can apply to any car. I don't think the game is P2W, as far as I know, you can get all stat-kits (of which there are maybe 10) from playing the game. In the Store are largely just cool ""skins"" of cars.

A lot of the customization for the Editor is also to be found there, so if you want to have all the cool stuff to put on you probably have to grind a lot (a lot lot). Overall I don't really think the Store is the biggest issue or really a breaking point, it really delegitimizes itself as all cars/boats are basically the same. Without exclusive stats, it's hard to imagine me buying something for real money. You can only buy with in-game bucks btw, so everything can be earned through playing. Or you can buy said in-game money for real money.



I would say that except for the Lego Editor, you are better off buying Horizon with the Lego DLC. It has better driving, Progression, and a much better open world. Speedtraps (and its leaderboards) alone are more fun than anything 2k Drive has to offer in their world. It's borderline insulting to ask for such a price when there is little to back it up. Every Vehicle feels the same in 2k Drive, I never felt like ""Oh cool, this is something new!!"" here. Largely because all vehicles come with stats (there are maybe 10 kits/variants) which you can also apply to all the other vehicles. So well.. your starting car can be a carbon copy of a McLaren you get in the Story at the end. Only the looks are different, it's just not feeling rewarding.

And Why exactly is this game always online? At least in Horizon you can see Drivators, and other players, and can play pretty seamlessly with others in events. Here you can't do that, it's completely single-player focused. The Multiplayer is literally in a different menu and has no leaderboards or something that would keep you playing. And on top of that the rewards are a joke.

I was fooled, as a LEGO fan myself I thought we got something along the lines of the Lego DLCs of Forza Horizon just now in a dedicated game. But absolutely everything is a downgrade compared to those games, its really not worth the money, sorry."

The base game is actually really fun. Driving is nice, the building is seriously impressive and in-depth, but it's a 60€ game with some really predatory microtransactions.

You start off with a decent selection of Lego Bricks, and you have to buy different cars and brick-sets to unlock more. Not bad design on its own, except earning the money ingame is incredibly slow, and clearly designed to be tedious on purpose. On top of that they have the fortnite-style FOMO shop, where items cycle weekly. This means that specific bricks can be completely unavailable to you if you miss them. There's also already a battle-pass, and they encourage that you buy the ingame cash with real money.

I wanna repeat: It's a f^cking 60€ game. Not 20€, not free to play. You pay 60€ so you can buy a battle-pass, grind currency like it's a F2P game, and cross your fingers that whatever part you want for a build just so happens to appear in the store. Genuine dogwater business practice.

The game is also clearly designed for a controller, with many features on mouse and keyboard being clunky or just straight up bugged (Rotating bricks is really strange, and so is placing waypoints on the map)"

Don't get me wrong, this is the best lego game I've played by miles, only toppable by the old star wars n inidiana games and *maybe* lego worlds. The racing is mid due to wayyyy too strong a catchup, but the cars and building are unbelievably fun. The powerups require skill to use in certain ways and theres strategy and cheats to every race that the game encourages in a rather fun manner. (when its not downright cheating....)

The building is some of the best in lego history. Literally allowing illegal building techniques (not official illegal the cursed ways of using the system.) And has a huge catalogue of parts even at the start.

Sadly the progression is grind slow at levels 15+, the story is boring compared to the antics in games like modnation racers, and the microtransactions are unforgivable. This is a kids game. No an account doesnt excuse this, and the prevention of using cars unless you ""approve"" them is beyond unbelivable Especially when I have 7 approved cars and 1 isnt so you stop me from playing online instead of telling me to change that one car, or just make that loadout unavailable until I change that. Why is there no track building? Why are the maps so small? Why make the intro sequence occur on a fun road side that players can never revisit? And why advertise a battlepass style system if it's not available at launch? I don't understand what's going on with this massive oversight of what could easily be bigger than forza and decided car classes would be handled by a preexisting system instead of something akin to forza or need for speed where your choices change performance? Why are game devs so allergic to that?"

(More honesty than your doctor recommends on my Curator page.)

A lot of us have fond memories of Lego Racers. The Forza Horizon 4 Lego add-on was pretty amazing and really delivered, but it wasn't quite the Lego Racers successor we wanted.

Now, there's this game. Is it the Lego Racers successor we wanted?

Hell no. ""Play Well""? More like Pay Well.

What it is is a posterchild for exploitative anticonsumerism, a pre-order-focused multiple-'edition'-selling DLC storefront with free-to-play-style monetization, including a 'starter pack,' cash shop currency (yeah, a full-priced eighty-Canadollar game has a cash shop), an excised-content 'season pass', and a pay-to-grind system. Not sure if there's literal gambling, but this paragraph alone is enough to avoid this. Start 'em young -- force anticonsumerism onto kids who have no knowledge of when the industry used to respect its customers and you can get away with literally anything, isn't that right, trash-tier publisher?

What does this game do right? Precious little.

In the Controls menu, we can use the Custom tab to remap all of our keybinds, and can map them to our mouse buttons, as well. Yep, that's some praise -- functionality that should be a staple.

Another thing I like is the powerup system. Powerups are mapped to the mouse's scroll wheel (with the LMB and RMB being Boost and Jump, like Rocket League, complete with anticonsumerism): scroll forward to launch an item forward, or back to attack behind you. Honestly feels pretty good; more natural than aiming the steering stick back to dump a shell behind you in Mario Kart or using your look behind and fire keys together like in that Sega kart racer or that GTA V mode.

Another positive: the 'jump to lightspeed' item might be a reference to Lego Racers' max-level boost item that did just that:


The vehicle building system seems promising, but the pieces you have available to you is minimal, since you're expected to keep shelling out real-life money for parts, it seems. Luckily with the user-built vehicles being better than anything we'd be able to make ourselves, that issue is lessened.

The only other good thing I have to say about Lego 2K DLC Storefront is that there's a user-built vehicle browser, which luckily means I have no incentive to pay any additional money for any of the nickel-and-dimed content the scumbag publisher tries to con kids into getting their moms' boyfriends to pay for.

Your car transforms -- or I guess, rebuilds -- from street vehicle to off-roader to boat, and it's loads of fun to have rocket-boosting K.I.T.T. from Knight Rider switch to Optimus Prime offroading and then to the flying DeLorean to fly over the drink. Not fun enough to make up for the shortcomings and exploitative monetization, mind you.


As for the rest, well, it's pretty much all downhill. We can't even build our own custom minifigure driver, which Lego Racers let us do in, what, '99? '00? No, now we're expected to pay some kind of currency to choose from a minifigure driver, or be expected to find one we like in the pay-to-grind system, and then pay, and then grind (or pay more) to get the minifig at all. It would be funny to me that there are parodies of Mulder and Scully among the minifig drivers... but considering I made them in Lego Indiana Jones and can't here, I'm not laughing.

Even the short-lived and never good Lego Universe MMO wasn't that boneheaded.

The driving, controls, and camera controls all feel awful. You're forced into doing side quests to level up to continue the story progress (like Saints Row 1 & 2), but the sidequests aren't fun (like Saints Row 1 & 2) and the requirements for beating them feel way too tight (like Saints Row 1 & 2). The camera controls are just awful, as is the vehicle handling, rendering missions to push a ball somewhere a why-bother-at-all level of difficult. (Seriously, why can't vehicle-focused games have free cameras as functional as UT2004? Even GTA V didn't mess that up.)

When you destroy an enemy racer (with powerups, by colliding with him, by landing on him which is pretty satisfying), the game tells you you've ""bricked"" him. Out of all the terms they could've chosen, they had to pick one that's sexual slang? I don't care how pretty that minifig lady is (or how much you paid for her on the pay-to-grind cash shop), please refrain from bricking all over her. Please.

Obviously the story and writing can't be expected to be anything even close to good (nor do they have to be), but for them to be this wince-inducing is an accomplishment. The writing will make you cringe and many of the voices are just plain annoying, like the robot guide guy or the monkey characters. Don't get me wrong, the Lego games never had great writing, but the slapstick antics of the TT games or the absurdist comedy of Lego Island didn't cause this level of facepalm-worthy irritation.

I have concerns about how long the game is. How few races are there that they want us to artificially pad out our playtime with forced non-fun sidequests? Or are we expected to just slog our way through the pay-to-grind system to unlock cars that aren't as cool as the user-built ones?

It's a shame it's not better, but damn, I didn't expect it to be this bad."

The good:
- Building your own Lego car with even technic parts and being able to build sideways is awesome. I really hope a new full Lego build game is in the works for the future.
- The racing is fun, but...

The bad:
- Microtransactions!
- The very low pay outs makes buying a car in the store an unhealthy grind unless you're willing to pay real money in an already $60 game...
- ...Which has a very short main story where the races and some quests have decent but not great pay-outs. After that it's earing less, yet the cars in the store are like 10.000 or higher.
- They actually have time limits (around 4 days) on the availability of certain vehicles in the store... With no clue when they will return.
- Some brick parts for making a vehicle need to be earned in the game or bought in the store. So there's a chance that if you bought the game to recreate a real Lego model you like, you might be missing parts.

If 2K changes the pay-outs to decent amounts (like at least $1000 or more per thing you do) I would recommend this game, now it feels like greed keeps it from being a fair game."

I genuinely like this game a lot but as of right now i cant recommend it and here is why:

the game has an item shop (where you can pay fake money you either earn in game or pay for with real money) [which that alone is kinda abhorrent for a kids game] but what IS EVEN WORSE is that it just does not function properly and crashes the game at the time of writing this review

this is a big problem, especially for a game that is riding on the back of the fact it has a impressive and very robust vehicle editor. because in order to unlock a lot of the parts for the cars and boats you wish to build you have to spend ""brick bux"" which again you unlock playing the game or with real money MTX and again THE STORE TO BUY THOSE PARTS CRASHES AS SOON AS YOU TRY TO OPEN IT

meaning YOU CANNOT ACTUALLY UNLOCK THE PARTS FOR ONE OF THE MAIN DRAWS OF THE GAME

so yeah don't buy it untill like months have gone passed and its on sale for like less than $20"

I like this game a lot, BUT it has some pretty big drawbacks too.

For a premium-priced game, it has way too much additional content that you have to purchase within the game to unlock. And not just cosmetic stuff—really fundamental building pieces that should absolutely be included in the parts drawer by default simply are not. Some you have to unlock while playing, and others you simply have to buy. And while you theoretically could get anything from the store with the Brickbux you earn by playing, the rate at which you earn is so incredibly slow that you'd be grinding forever to get even the tiniest thing.

Second, while the building mode is very good on the whole, you are limited to fixed predetermined wheelbases on which to build your vehicles. I expected to be able to build whole vehicles from the ground up using whatever wheels I wanted wherever I want them to be. A very reasonable expectation that I was not alone in having. The wheelbases available by default are very limited, and totally wrong for most of the builds I had hoped to make. And while you can get additional wheelbases, that requires—you guessed it—additional purchases from the store. And even then, you don't exactly get new wheelbases, but whole vehicles you can strip down and modify. And in many cases, you're left with way too much baggage from the original car that you can't remove. But of course you can't tell exactly what will be left until after you've already purchased the vehicle.

Finally, it's really buggy. I'm hoping it's just because it's a new release and that they'll fix the many glitches soon, but in the meantime, it's really annoying. At the moment, I can't even get into the store to make those unfortunately necessary purchases, because the game crashes the moment I enter ""Unkie's Emporium"" (the store).

Anyway, I'm still giving this a positive rating on the whole. Other than my listed gripes, this is a fantastic and super fun game. It's exactly the sequel to the Lego Racers games many of us have been wanting for a long time. I just wish they'd sort out the issues."

Got to play during free weekend. Fun, but littered with pay-to-play micro-transactions. If it were free I would play it and maybe even give in to some of these purchases, but I'm not paying both.

I miss the simple days of LEGO Racers and LEGO Island..."
lego+2k+drive,Not Recommended,11.7,"Posted: September 5
Tried this out during a free weekend. It's a cute and fun game, story is heavily reliant on Lego Movie comedy-style, good powerups, good vehicle builder albeit with clunky controls, has some huge core problems that are impossible to disregard.

- AI blatantly cheats, speeding up and slowing down arbitrarily. That said, winning is not that hard. Most tracks have ""secret routes"" that you more or less have to use to be able to win. Specifically, in some tracks, if you don't take a ""secret route"" your rival racer in that specific race will teleport onto it regardless where they were previously, taking the lead. This is not a ""fair"" racegame.

- Some of the minigames haven't been properly playtested, making them unnecessarily difficult and frustrating compared to other sections of the game.

- Any speed/handling/weight stats of a vehicle seem to have little to no effect. It's a good thing in the sense that you aren't limited to min-maxing your vehicle to be a specific size to win, but it's bad in that in a game where each vehicle is supposed to have their own stats which gives bonuses to performance, that aspect is entirely negligible. Why bother having it in the first place.

- The vehicle builder offers you a lot of standard bricks to use for building, but a lot of detail bricks are locked behind a paywall or only available in brick packs for thousands of in-game currency, which becomes increasingly time-consuming to attain. The fact that a lot of the vehicles you unlock use these bricks, but you yourself can't use them unless you pay money, is frustrating and impedes creativity.

- Vehicle builder is limited in that you can only select from a premade chassis/hull either from 5-6 standard ones or through taking a standard car and removing all blocks, leaving you with a chassis/hull. You can't do one entirely on your own, making your own vehicle with e.g. 10 functional wheels.

- Vehicle builder is limited to 350 bricks, which initially comes off as fair but becomes limited when trying to build larger or more detailed builds. It's further frustrating that premade chassis/hulls add to this count, so depending on your chassis/hull you are already ""weighed down"" by several bricks.

- No minifigure customization. You are given a roster of 5 or so minifigs to choose from to have as your racer, after that you can unlock more through playing but the vast, vast majority are locked behind brick bucks or an outright paywall. You don't unlock parts and can't customize your own minifigure, which has been a huge staple in past Lego games including Lego Racers and Lego Racers 2.

- Overall in-game economy is predatory. Every time you start the game you are incentivized to pay money to unlock further features. The game is extremely expensive for what it is and has ridiculous ""premium features"" for an even more ridiculous price, up to 119,99€. You are still expected to pay more for premium currency to unlock further features unless you are willing to dedicate hundreds of hours.

This is a freemium game with a triple-A price tag on it. As bad as that is, it makes it several times worse that this game is mainly intended for children. After checking, it seems like the online community for this game is essentially dead, only temporarily being boosted by the free weekend. I don't see this being maintained for that much longer. Don't buy this game."
lego+2k+drive,Not Recommended,24.1,"Posted: May 20
I'm not gonna sugercoat it.
The Game is fun when you play it for 20 hours. After that you're pretty much through the story and it's races. Well what do you do then?
That's right, collect all collectables and do ""On-The-Go"" missions. (On-The-Go mission are basically timetrials)
At this point the game feels like a chore to me, personally. If you like doing that well you have around 30 hours of fun doing all that.
Then there is the editor, cause lets be honest you just want to race your own creations through the game. The Editor itself is really good for what it offers, but it's lacking. And with lacking I mean 40% of the parts that other preset cars have are missing for your own creations. (The screenshot on the games shoppage is therefore VERY missleading and does not represent the editor where you can create you're own cars. YOU CAN EDIT presets, but again, only with the parts that are given to you.
Then again there is the problem with microtransactions, cause lets be fair, which game nowadays that's running under a well known franchise doesn't have it. And this game is no different.
If you ever forget about the ingame shop, don't you worry, the game will remind you every 30 minutes that you can pay real money to get more stuff like preset cars, stickers, some useless bricks and characters.

All in all i would not recommend the game for it's current price, get it for around 20 dollars and don't expect much.

Personally i'm quite sad that this is the current state of the game, i was really looking forward to play it quite alot. I probably will, but just have some fun in the editor."

This game, while I do enjoy it, emanates that classic 2K funk that permeates and ruins everything it comes into contact with. Another live service, season based content drip feed targeted at children that I would argue is more predatory than fortnite.

The main currency of the game, brickbux, is tedious to get with some of the larger events only dishing out 500 or so, while vehicles can cost up to 10-14k. Of course, you can't buy brickbux with real money, but you can buy coins, which are ONLY used to trade for brickbux.

You can buy them in in quantities of 500, 1100, 2300, 3600 and 6500. The price of them isn't shown to you in-game. These coins can only be traded for brickbux, with the exchanges being 50 coins for 1k brickbux, 500 for 10k, and 4500 for 100k.

This, to me, is obviously only to make how much you're going to be spending as confusing as possible, especially to children who don't have a good grasp of real money. As much as I do enjoy the game itself, the store feels gross, predatory and downright pathetic. I'd say 2K should feel ashamed about putting this in a lego game, but we already know corporate suits don't feel anything but greed"

Builder oriented review: see bellow

Edit: Turned the review to positive since I enjoyed the rest of the game much more that I thought I would. So much so that, frustrated by the lack of in-game information, I created the L2KD Encyclopedia:
https://r0levrai.github.io/l2kd-encyclopedia/
(actually much of my play time was dev time :D)

---

Builder oriented, old review (at 15h of playtime): mixed, could turn positive from future improvemens! TL;DR:

+ I like the gameplay, graphics and humors!
- But not the price/monetisation (w.r.t. the content), lack of QoL on PC, and more importantly, very constraining build system (which is mostly why I bought the game for).
-> Had I discovered that less than 2h in, i would have probably refunded.
-> If you like building vehicles, you might be better served by something like trailmaker for now.

---

Long version:

gameplay:
+ drifting, transforming, smashing pieces from the decor to regain nitro is a blast
+ activities diversity, humor
+ split screen on nearly everything
+ playable offline, for the most part (good for occasional play, bad for unlocking stuff since you don't have the shop and solo rates past the story are abysmal)

build:
+ some cool features: materials, hinges (even if they are statics)
+ beautiful
- you cant chose where the wheels go:
- each car/boat have a different, non-editable base (which sometimes amount to a very big chunk of the vehicle)
- they lose their unique stickers (=decals) when edited (sooo you paid for the game, paid for the battle passes, and still can't really edit your super shiney car... urgh).
- most building blocks are locked behind story, battle passes, temporary rotating shop, lots of bux grinding (multiplayer), and assembling cars by following instructions (can be fun in small doses, if not for pc clunky controls). Considering you also unlock vehicles, minifigures, stickers, engine & horn sounds, and flairs (an animeted, inseparable group of bricks), I would at least have given all or more essential bricks from the start.
- no custom figudres/stickers. as for base stickers... I can't stack them (wtf ?!), can't scale them like I want, can't color them like I want (paint is only multiplicative, but most are with strong/dark colors... would need hue shift or at least an additive option), lack diversity, some part can't even accept stickers where it would be logical... urgh
- don't have flexible parts (could do with splines)
-> makes redoing most things you loved, from lego or another reference, mostly impossible (you can still do a lot, but maybe 10% of my ideas turned feasible)

collection:
- no archive/list of (un)olocked parts and how to(/how you did) unlock them. Because the community is very small, it doesn't make for this missing info (at least it's not on the wiki yet)
- in the shop, it's not clear what is the type of object you are buying (parts, flairs, vehicles, sound ?), and if it's a vehicle, what does it unlock - surplus parts (no way to know in advance), stats (yes), base/sounds/stickers (no, which is a shame)...
-> make choosing (where) to invest very hard, especially for the surplus parts.
- no powerup explanations
- no multiplayer rank RP requirement / rewards info

QoL/attention to detail:
- some collision can send you implausibly fast in reverse
- impossible to search other creations by name (could be in a separate website with build ids)
- building mouse/keyboard controls are very clunky. edit: cut examples, was too long ^^
- crash on/after some alt-tab (3 times in menus and 1 time in race in ~15h)
- blocking highlighting bug in the advanced building tutorial ch16 (edit: can't repro)
- no workshop support, nor any external share feature - having 2d, 3d and/or sharing code embeded in the same place could really help with this game discoverability/virality in my opinion.
- no mod support
- denuevo, which is very concerning for security and privacy"

If you wanna build cars almost from scratch (just need to pick a base) then you'll love this.
If you're like me and you wanted Mario Kart, you'll be a bit disappointed. There's just not enough in the game right now to justify its price tag.
Also each online race rewards $25, $16, and $12 for the top 3 racers. The average price for a vehicle from the store is $10,000. That requires 400 wins for 1 car. 2k is gonna kill this game with these micro-transactions if they don't fix em soon, calling it now.

Edit: The multiplayer race rewards now give +50 brickbucks to ALL participants. So now 1st, 2nd, and 3rd make $75, $66, and $62 respectively. This now means that, to be able to afford a $10k car, you would have to win minimum 134 races. Still bad, but at least it's better."

Yes it looks good. but it looks like this company goes for the money and not for the experience. The creators could have written history by making it less grindy.

system i9-13900k, 32GB DDR5, RTX3080TI, M2 SSD
Awesome presentation & performance, Mixed (*wink* *wink*) with 2K money grabbing.

First off: it's nice to see an Unreal engine game that doesn't suffer from constant shader stuttering. The game runs smooth and looks crisp. 4k (2k native with DLDSR 2.25), maxed, 100+FPS.

This is a fun racer, don't expect anything too challenging during the story run - focusing on top speed & handling aswell as learning how to drift to boost your... booster does the trick. Finishing all open world challenges with gold medals is far more demanding.

So are the online races. The better drivers know the courses by heart and know the short cuts (try to stick to them and learn).

The vehicle editor is perfectly alright. Learn how to multi-select parts and mirror them and you have a far easier time. Knowing your LEGO helps alot though. I highly recommend to unlock most bricks first, before diving deep into the editor.

Sadly, certain bricks (especially the cool ones) are restricted to the vehicles you win (or buy) during the career. Same goes for the chassis. You can't freely create them but have to use templates or the ones from won/bought vehicles.

Still, there's plenty of space for your creativity. So far, I recreated the APC from Aliens and the Munster Koach from the Munsters TV show. Next up: a Hennesey 6x6 Raptor :P

Considering that kids are the target group, the amount of micro transaction items is over the top. Just don't give in ;) While you can make decent store cash from the campaign, rewards from online races are not worth mentioning. I recommend to prioritize bricks and only buy legendary vehicles, if any.

You get tons of cool vehicles and items during the campaign and from open world activities (quests, challenges etc.). So, if you play the game, there's hardly any need for the store.

I can imagine that most kids will struggle with the spatial awareness needed to get things done as they want to in the editor. It's one thing to build something from actual bricks, and another to do so virtually in an editor.

LEGO® 2K Drive is a fun Mario-Kart like racing game with all the LEGO charm you expect. It's not a hardcore racing game and while it will entertain for quite a while it's not nearly as sophisticated as other racing games out there. There is a lot of monetization potential, but it's not the pay-to-win hell some try to make you belief. The LEGO vehicle editor allows countless wild designs but takes its time to master.

This is not a car racing game. This game will do anything it can to keep you from racing.

Yes, it is very clever, there are a lot of interesting game modes, the models are great, but.... I really just wanted a *racing game* to fill my Forza Horizon shaped hole, and *this game is not at all about racing your car*. It's about jumping puzzles, it's about (literal) tower defense, it's about car bowling, this game will do anything it can to actually keep you from going fast for more than ten seconds because apparently that's too long for the ADHD players it's aimed at.

Let me directly quote from the last two 'race's I played:

Red Brick Green Brick:
1. Go when TUBE turns away.
2. Stop when TUBE turns back around.
3. Stop in time or you go BOOM!

Robot Invasion (the literal tower defense):
1. Defeat three waves of enemies!
2. Smash into enemies!
3. Powerups destroy more enemies!
4. Save generators & reach target score!

I can appreciate them taking the effort to make these two separate game modes for these two 'races', but they are in no way 'races', and you spend over half your time braking and awkwardly turning at slow speed. At no point to do you ever get up to full speed. There is very much *no racing*. And that's the usual experience.

So as a racing game, this is entirely a bust, and if you wanted a LEGO Forza you will be sorely disappointed. But if you have kids who get bored with anything after 15 seconds this might be great."

After 117 hours of wasting my time as a 17 year old high schooler to maintain a promise I made when I was seven to 100% any Lego game I played. I finally did it today. This game literally took me back in time to where I was playing The Complete Saga on the DS and the Wii. It was a much needed ""one last time"" event that took me back before I become a legal adult. And although I can never go back in time, this game certainly did just that... except for the fact that its not a DS that I could take with me where ever I wanted or a Wii that that kept crashing every few weeks."

Let me start out by saying two things. 1: I like the Complete Saga better, but that may be because that game was my childhood. 2: This is a fantastic successor to the CS. Now I will get into what I view as the pros and cons of the game. SPOILERS?

Pros:
1. Lego humor has never been funnier
2. The game is open world
3. Ship combat is fun
4. The visuals are stunning
5. There is so much to do
6. Taking a capital ship is fun
7. There are so many details in this game
8. Can't believe I have to say this but in today's gaming industry we finally have a game that isn't a mess at launch
9. Side quests are fun

Cons:
1. My biggest gripe is that when it comes to the actual missions they feel lacking in content, they could have added more from each episode for sure. My biggest issue with this is that there is no level for the opening battle scene from Revenge of the Sith, that was my favorite level in Complete Saga. That may just be me though
2. This isn't really a con for me because I am definatly a more casual gamer, and this is a game for children, but the game is very easy. If your tired of Dark Souls and Elden Ring and just want to relax look no further.

This game is for sure worth the 2 year delay and the $60
Edit: After taking the Death Star this game is better"

After over 100 hours I have completed 100% of Lego Star Wars and have to say it is the best Lego game I have ever played.

What was good?

- Lots of planets to explore - 24 in total which are well filled
with collectibles, quests or small challenges

- 45 levels, which offer a lot of variety

- Over 407 characters to explore the galaxy with.

- There are enough collectibles, like blue bricks,
spaceships, characters, as always the minikits and the
challenges that you can complete

- And of course the classic Lego humor which is as always throughout the game and often makes you smile.

- The graphics were excellent and let you experience the Lego world like never before.

What was bad?:

The biggest problem Lego Star Wars has is that it is very repetitive in many places. Unfortunately, elements were often used more than once, especially in the collectibles and also for space battles, some quests and blue bricks.

Unfortunately, there are also some small bugs in the levels. For example, sometimes you can not complete some challenges or the level simply does not go on because certain cut scenes are not triggered.

Conclusion:

In the end I can say that Lego Star Wars The Skywalker Saga is a game that convinced me and can offer a lot of fun if you are interested in Lego or Star Wars games. I bought it at release, played the main story once and now set out to complete it to 100% and can say it was worth every penny for me. If you are not sure if you should buy it then maybe wait until it is reduced and give it a chance.

Overall I would give the game a rating of 8.5/10."

The game developer essentially deceived me by claiming that the deluxe edition would include all upcoming DLCs. This deceptive practice is not new to me; games like Assassin's Creed Valhalla also pulled a similar move with the Ragnarok DLC. People opt for the most expensive game pack so that they don't have to spend more money on the same game. However, it turns out they broke their promise. They should have disclosed earlier that there would be multiple season pass DLCs, but they kept it a secret. It feels like a government agency or some other regulatory body should investigate these kinds of deceptive practices. Why do I call it a scam? Because it influenced my purchasing decision when I initially bought the game. I believed I would receive all the DLC, but it turned out that I still needed to pay for more.

The game is fantastic, but the developer essentially deceived me by not being transparent about the DLC."

I want to make the point that this game is not LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga. I know people wanted it to be, but it isn’t. The mechanics are different, the levels are different, the style is different, everything is different except for the story. There have been a lot of complaints about the level design being “too easy” or the levels are too short. Again, I want to point out that LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga came out 15 years ago and LEGO and Travelers Tales have changed their format, level design, and overall gameplay a few times over since then. I personally did not want a “remastered” game, I wanted a new game, one that would change the formula of LEGO games. I would say that this game definitely does that. To be clear, at the writing of this review, I have completed 6 of the 9 films on story mode alone (1,2,3,4,5,7).

Looking to the complaint of the short levels, I will agree, the levels are significantly shorter in this game than in the past. That does not mean, however, that there is less content. In addition, I think the voice actors do a great job of summarizing the Star Wars story with letting direct quotes and general set pieces direct the story. The one thing that seems to be more interesting about this game is that the open world is very integrated into the story. You have to go from one mission to the other (for the most part) by traveling to the planets yourself, or the different areas of said planets. The story definitely feels shorter, but I would say it reminds me of a “spark notes” version of Star Wars, especially with the voice acting in the game adding depth to the story. The mumble mode is a fun nostalgic call back to the old games, but in my unpopular opinion, it does not work for this game. The reason why it worked in the old games was because the characters mouths don’t move, but they are fully voice acted with detailed mouth movement. The Clone Wars voice actors sound phenomenal in the prequel trilogy and would highly recommend playing through with mumble mode off. Of course, I will play some stuff with mumble mode on for funs sake.

For those worried about trekking over everywhere to get to missions, there is a designated area in the menu to play just the missions again once it has been played through on story mode. This game still has a lot of unlockables, lots of upgrading, and plenty of time to spend hanging out in the Star Wars universe. The combat in this game is really new and exciting with “combos” being implemented as well as interesting mechanics with both lightsabers and blasters.

Overall, I would say this game is an exciting, fun, new aspect of not only the Star Wars franchise, but also LEGO games in general.

10/10

Pro:
Fun nostalgic callback to my childhood
Interesting new levels
Open world is refreshing and seamless into the story
Completionist dream
Voice Acting is wonderful (Prequel trilogy with Clone Wars voice acting is *wonderful*
Mumble mode

Cons:
Levels/Story is slightly shorter than previous installments of LEGO games
Open world can be overwhelming when starting off
Some small bugs

tl;dr – game is super fun, “this is where the fun begins”

The Silenzeio guide to: Lego games

Skywalker Saga... Tt Games' most ambitious Lego game to date. I was hyped for this game. I was hyped since it was first announced. All nine mainline films in one package, enhanced with a new game engine, graphics, overhauled gameplay and combat... I was interested. Intrigued. This was the first game i ever pre-ordered, shelled out a couple extra for deluxe edition. Was my hype met now that i've finally played it? Some of it was elevated... Some of it met the limit of my hype... But most of this game... It fell below that hype.

I'll start with my positives. This game is absolutely GORGEOUS. It is a feast for the eyes anywhere you go. This is Tt Games' art and environment teams let absolutely loose and they delivered in droves. With the 24 planets that can be explored with the little areas within them, both teams captured the look of these planets and Star Wars perfectly. The detail of sand or snow covering parts of your characters the more they run around the sands of Tatooine, Pasana, Jakku or the snows of Hoth add to the detail put into this game.

The humor in cutscenes is also top notch, probably the funniest i've watched to date. Remember that i'm exclusively flagging the word ""cutscenes"".

The fights versus Capital Ships were fun? Sometimes fighting the boss of the ship was a bit off.

The negatives... This game otherwise feels... Soulless. Let me explain.

The movies, for lack of a better word, are ""cannibalised"" to me. To make an example, let's start where i did. Episode 1. Now the first level of Phantom Menace in Complete Saga should be nostalgic to anyone. Might take up of 4-5 minutes to complete, utilises the Force skills of the two Jedi and shows how to use protocol droids to open certain panels. Skywalker Saga? You can hold down sprint, ignore every enemy in your way and be done this story section in a minute or two. Negotiations isn't even Phantom Menace's first proper level. It's just a point A to B run. Followed by more point A to B running tagging along with Jar Jar to go towards the Gungan city of Otoh Gunga... Where you do more walking to get to another cutscene AND THEN the first level begins... The underwater submarine trip to Theed, dodging the fish trying to eat the heroes.

Each movie is just rushed through to get to a short level where you can basically use one character to get through it all. Either that or an incredibly short vehicle level. There's no real puzzles to Skywalker Saga's levels when compared to other Lego or Lego Star Wars games. I made an example of Complete Saga's ""Negotiations"" level and how you use two character types to beat it. Encouraging swapping characters in solo play or cooperative play. Skywalker Saga just feels like a nothing burger in between running from cutscene to cutscene to level.

Character uniqueness is robbed with the introduction of the class/skill system. To take from the Force Awakens game, Finn can use First Order terminals right through the game. Even when he joins the Resistance, he can still use them. Because that's in his character as a former First Order soldier. Here? The moment he swaps from the ""Evil"" class to the ""Hero"" class, he loses ALL access to ""Evil"" class terminals which he can use in the first level of Skywalker Saga's Force Awakens level.

My least favorite addition to levels in this game have to be the tied in ""Challenges"". Unless you buy the rumor to get a vague hint at what to do or look online, these challenges will remain locked behind random question marks. Extra faff on top of a new three tier True Jedi stud bar (Why three? We've had the one ""True"" stud bar for over a decade and it makes no sense) and five minikits to dig up. Just chop out the challenges and turn every level from 6 Kyber Bricks to 5.

The vehicles themselves often times decided to not work with me when i turned. Like sometimes the vehicle would ""stick"" in one direction for a few seconds and would only fix if i kept aggressively swiping my mouse where i wanted to turn. This basically killed all vehicle levels and space sections most of the time. Thankfully these levels are painfully short so i could get back into the mindless point A-B cutscene to cutscene running.

So what about the open worlds i hear you ask? With 24 planets to go to, surely there's something there other than their looks?

And you'd be wrong. I streamed my 100% Kyber Brick and Side Mission grind on Discord to my girlfriend. And even she could pick up how bored i must have been immediately picking up a Kyber Brick after a ""puzzle"" that wouldn't even require someone to rub two braincells together, opening the holomap, clicking on the next Brick rumor and immediately sprinting towards it to rinse and repeat until i was done. And she was right.

There are 1200 Kyber Bricks in Skywalker Saga. Where the recent Lego games had over 200 Gold Bricks to chase down, any found in the open world at least required a degree of thinking. In simple terms, Skywalker Saga took quantity over quality. So i hope you're in for an incredibly boring grind to a 100% save file. I hope you find the stud fountain worth it... Or the completely patronising clapping from the main heroes of the trilogies. 1200 Kyber Bricks later and that's it?

Speaking of quantity over quality, i sure hope you enjoy the copy and paste puzzles found on every planet let alone the capital ships... Those are the most egregious when it comes to the rule. Because all nine capital ships share the EXACT SAME KYBER BRICK ""PUZZLES"". Maybe one variation between each of them but that's just me being generous. The side missions themselves can often be drawn out too if the quest tasks you with going off world to a different planet or three. And don't get me started on ANY mission requiring you to smuggle goods from one planet to another. Because every time you take one of those quests, you get three waves of space combat that pulls you out of hyperspace before you get to your destination. And given how dumb the enemies are, it's just a matter of pursuing them to line up shots. Tedium in a nutshell.

I've even encountered enemies in the side quests or the bosses of the Capital Ship raids that for an extended period of time would just refuse to take damage after shooting them and then miraculously they took a bolt and became invulnerable again. This became even more laughable once i upgraded the Bounty Hunter class with the amount of bolts they can burst fire and kept on shooting some quest essential enemies or Capital Ship bosses. It didn't matter how many ridiculous spray and pray bolts hit my target, the game made them immortal until it said otherwise, turned off the switch and turned it on again. More tedium.

And the bugs that plague the NTT engine were annoying. One bug that kept on appearing unless i quit to main menu and reopened my save game was that after landing on a planet, one of the two characters i was with would shrink. Totally unfixable.

On the topic of your second character, they're effectively useless in solo play. They just will REFUSE to help you in combat. And even if they do, they will miss entire saber swings or blaster shots.

And if you decide to play this game in co-op, i hope your second player doesn't get too bored with basically not participating in most of the bigger sequences of the game. The final fight between Obi-Wan and Anakin in Revenge of the Sith? Player one gets to be Obi-wan, player two gets to stand there and watch as either C-3PO or R2-D2. Most of this game follows this ethos that goes against the second player having any fun. Which is a MAJOR step down in quality for a Lego game. A Tt Lego game at that.

I played many of the Lego Games in the past, and even thou they were mostly the same, beside the settings, I always had a good time with them.
But they definitely needed an overhaul, and thankfully with this Game, they finally got it!

Story
Lego Star Wars The Skywalker Saga includes the Story of all 9 Movies in a compressed way. The cutscenes are cut down to the very basic information’s of the Story, which isn’t a bad thing directly, since the Lego games were never meant for long drawn out cutscenes. It can be hard to follow what’s going on thou in case you haven’t seen the Movies. Over the course of the Story, you visit all Iconic locations from the franchise like you would expect.
You can choose to either begin the game at Episode 1, 4 or 7, depending on the order you want to experience them.


The gameplay is mostly the same as in the old games, destroy everything and loot studs! The game isn’t too hard and you don’t lose to much in case you die, its designed to be a relaxing, enjoyable experience and they definitely succeed with that.
But thankfully, they did improve the game systems. The 380 Characters you can unlock are sorted into different categories like Jedi, Hero, Scavenger, Bounty Hunter, Droid etc. Each category has different skills you can invest into which can be upgraded in 3 Tiers each on top. You get skill points by collecting Special Bricks in each level, which are rewarded for different goals and challenges.
The combat system also got a general overhaul and is now more versatile compared to the old games.
Beside that you can also collect Mini-kits, Vehicles and of course, new Characters. The levels feel bigger to me like in the old games and more open ended. Each is filled with a ton of Stuff to do, if you enjoy collecting Items and upgrades, you will find your happiness here. And like in the old games, the levels are designed in a way, that not everything can be looted the first time you visit a location. Some items need talents or Characters you will only obtain later to reach.


The Graphic is a lovely mix of detailed Lego Models and Bricks/Structures and a more real general atheistic of the environments, which works out flawlessly in my eyes.
The Audio is really good, it sounds like you would Star Wars expect to sound.


If you enjoyed the old Lego games, you will immediately feel at home in the Skywalker Saga, all the new features, and a game that can be enjoyed solo or in coop with a friend, with the good Lego Humor on top guarantees a good time.
If you are new to the Series and/or just found the game because you are a Star Wars fan and you are on the lookout for a relaxing game that can keep you busy for hours, or just for a while after a long day, I can fully recommend Lego Star Wars The Skywalker Saga to you as well!"

MY RATING: 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 ✘ 9 / 10

Much to read, you still have…

... because I think this will be one of the longest review I've ever written. Well, it probably won't be a real review. I think it will be more of a story about me and the initial conflict about the game.

I've been putting off this „review“ for weeks because I don't even know exactly why this is so important to me and I just can't find the right words.
It may well be that this has something to do with the partly negative reviews, which I can also understand somewhere. But also because I was a bit disappointed with the game myself at first and I needed some distance from the game to think about it. After all, I've been waiting for this game for a long time and I'm really looking forward to it. Admittedly, it's also one of the few games that I bought right after it was released.



I downloaded the game, started it and then went to the menu. Let's see what has changed.
Yes, hello, what is that? That's a menu, a real one. No longer such a spartan menu as in the other Lego games where you can only adjust the volume, effects and a few graphic settings. Yes oops. I can adjust a lot of things. That's amazing. I really like that. A few settings made and off you go.

Hm, now I have to decide which level or which part to start with. Well, since I'm as old as the Star Wars films themselves, I went with the ""classic"" variety, the order of release.
So in this case Episode IV. So the first level and...
""wow, what's that,"" that looks mega. That's absolutely amazing what had an effect on me graphically and playfully. I would not have expected that in my life.
So get into the fray and diligently cut up and tear down everything that comes in my way and yikes, what's up now?
As ? Why is the level over now?
I've only just played what feels like 5 minutes?
What's happening ?

, I look at the cutscene when my wife comes home and says: oh cool, the new Lego Star Wars. And how is it ?

Yeah, um, I don't know, I said. Actually totally great, but I just played a level and it was over after what felt like 5 minutes.
How can that be ?
It wasn't like that in The Complete Saga.
Exactly, that wasn't it and that's what made it so difficult for me and somehow I didn't enjoy it anymore.
Of course, I then took a closer look at what had been written about the game so far and especially the negative reviews and the more I read, the “worse” things got for me too.
At some point I didn't feel like playing the game anymore that I really left it there for days.

One morning when I opened Steam at work I came across these two videos:


When I watched these videos it kind of “clicked” for me and when I got home in the evening I grabbed my kids and said, listen, you have to play the new Lego Star Wars now.
How you make your kids play Lego Star Wars...

Well, I wouldn't necessarily call it that. I'd rather say I've changed the priorities a bit, but joking aside, I asked them if they wanted to do that because I assumed they weren't averse to it anyway and because they've also enjoyed playing Lego games so far.
But since I didn't want to buy the game again, family sharing and my own score had to be used and I couldn't continue playing myself for the time being. But it doesn't matter, it was a good thing because after a short time I heard the first giggles, laughter and phrases like ""oh, how cool is that"" or ""that's mega"" from the rooms.
Unlike my son, who, like his father, first destroys everything in the area to see what is left at the end and only then deals with the rest, my daughter prefers to spend time exploring Tatooine, taking her time in peace to stroll around the area and see what there is to discover, who to talk to and what else you can do. In the following days, more and more friends joined them. It got louder, wilder and more and more difficult to get the kidz away from the game.



What I mean to say is that Lego games are actually primarily designed for children, even though the games have been enjoying increasing popularity among (younger) adults for quite some time. Nevertheless, one shouldn't forget that children (by that I don't mean all adults for the moment) have a different point of view and also value other things. For the moment, a child doesn't really care if R2D2 suddenly can't hoover anymore, as long as it's even aware of it. For me, the character editor has never been relevant, except for the respective achievement. Others do, and that's fine, but there will certainly be reasons from the developers that some things in the game just aren't the way we used to be. Maybe even licensed. I think you can't always have everything, no matter how nice it is.

When I asked them what they think of the game, everyone said it's the coolest Lego (Star Wars) game they've played. Yes, but what about The Complete Saga? I mean how does it compare to that?
The answers were quite simple and unanimous. They are just two different games and they have nothing to do with each other.


The point that was so decisive and important for me. Considering the game as a sequel, remake or whatever, apart from the technical changes/innovations, it's fair to say it's bad.
But that's not it. In no way.
It is a new, independent and, above all, different game that should not be compared. Even if it's a bit difficult at times. But if you can do that, then the game is also a lot of fun.



The Star Wars story is told more in the cutscenes. These are, in this case, also shortened to be suitable for children and the dialogues actually only consist of the well-known quotes. Strictly speaking, Lego Star Wars doesn't actually tell a story, but is more of a commentary track that emphasizes silly jokes. These jokes usually consist of the characters suddenly deviating from the script and doing something different, unexpected or stupid.
So if you haven't seen the films, it can happen that these references aren't funny without an explanation and don't make any sense in relation to the story either. The game is clearly aimed at fans, but it's also suitable for children.


The Skywalker Saga is a Lego game I've been expecting in 2022 and have been wanting for years.
The fact that Lego games aren't perfect, that one or the other doesn't work that well and that the level of difficulty isn't particularly demanding is simply part of it for me and it doesn't bother me in the least.

The definitive LEGO Star Wars game

Pretty much covers Episodes I-IX with content and references to the other films / shows.

One of the few times Deluxe Content is actually worth it plus Pre-order.

I've played these from the first installment and mastered every game since then going on almost 20 years.

This game truly captures the familiar vibes while adding its own modern twists.

Gameplay is pretty smooth and the combat reminds me a little bit of DMC / GOW.

I love how you can do Mute Voices with Retro Graphics.

Performance runs like water even on an older PC and the graphics are crisp.

Runs about as well as Consoles. I played on there first before getting early access here.

You can do Controller as well as Keyboard and Mouse.

I rate this: 100% True Jedi

May the Force be with you and God Speed."

100%'d the game so I've done every scripted thing you can do and what can I say about this.

Well for fans who wanted a LEGO Star Wars game as good as TCS since it came out, this is the answer you're looking for. It's humor and zany cutscenes have devolved since the older games, but the tradeoff is a complete rework including redone levels, an excellent combat system and an expansive galaxy that has a decently immersive effect.

First, the Story: The story does a more accurate job of retelling the saga with tons of decent voiceacting (you can turn off voice acting with mumble mode to have an older LEGO experience. I will say though, mumble mode isn't single mumbles, they mumble out entire sentences, so it feels a little weird), the cutscenes work with or without voiceacting which is a surreal dynamic experience that the devs get my kudos on, but the levels themselves are really short and kind've disappointing. They introduce ""level challenges"", there are 3 in every level and they're alternative ways of going about each one. They're fun in general, but if you're trying to 100% they can be a nightmare sometimes. Minikits have been reduced from 10 to 5 per level, which was debatably my favorite part about replaying a level. Overall, cutscene and immersion-wise, the levels are fun to play and have the same great puzzle-solving they've always had, replayability is quite low though.

First-Time through 9/10
Free-Play 100% 6/10 (basically, thank god they're short)

Now Galaxy-Mode was easily the most fun I've had through the whole experience. Instead of collecting gold bricks to a grand total of 250, (using the Marvel Avengers game as the mold here since it's the last one I 100%'d, god it sucked), there are 1,160 bricks, (known as ""kyber bricks"") that are collectable through completing level challenges, collecting minikits, getting ""true jedi"" on each level, doing side quests among 33 planets, destroying kyber comets, smuggling, doing bounty hunts, and puzzles on each and every planet. It was a ton of fun to mark each planet off the list as I collected each planets' worth. Some quests can only be done if you've progressed through the story up until that point, or until you've done other side quests. Personally, I recommend playing the base game all the way through 4-6, 1-3, 7-9, THEN doing galaxy-mode, so there will be less holdups. In advance, there was only 1 planet that gave me trouble and it was Endor, my guess is, the fire VFX would keep spawning as you loaded new areas, and it wouldn't unload areas you're not in anymore so the constant fire VFX made it a laggy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. (However, entering a village hut loading zone, then exiting refreshed the lag, which led me to believe it was fire VFX that wouldn't unload.) Other than that, the quests and puzzles are really fun to complete.

9/10, it is the after-story experience you want.

I'll wrap it up here with the UI, combat/upgrade system, and the red bricks rework.
So the UI for the most part is pretty straightforward, might take a bit of learning but once you have it down, it all makes sense, stuff goes where it should go, changing characters is a bit messy and if you have OCD about how you want your free-play characters organized, that might be a huge problem because thats the only place where the UI falters heavily. Once you play, you'll figure out what I mean.

The combat system is EXTREMELY intricate, you have a third person firing mode with guns and saber-throwing. There's also cover you can hide behind (and rebuild if it gets destroyed) and shoot from if you want to play that way. The biggest highlight though is the melee combat system. You initiate combat with a standard attack which can then go into changeups like heavy attacks, uppercut moves, and spike moves, depending on which corresponding button you press. These changeups become extremely prevalent in the lightsaber boss duels which make you feel like you control how the corresponding movie-scene flows.

The red brick rework has been made easier to manage and deal with, you don't collect red bricks, instead you collect ""Data cards"" (1 per particular planet) in galaxy mode. They aren't specific to certain extras, you get the data card and choose which extra you want. (I recommend not buying anything until you get your first data card and do the stud multiplier route, things are hella expensive this time around so I'd say focus on getting all multipliers before you buy anything else) That being said ""Stud magnet"" and ""Fast build"" aren't extras anymore, they're ""Upgrades""

The upgrade system integrates things like collecting studs, building faster, sprinting quicker, having more health, doing more damage, etc. which is where kyber bricks come in, as they are used as it's currency, plus an additional stud fee. (Now this is the exception to my advice about ""not buying anything"", buy upgrades when you can) There are core upgrades and class upgrades for specific character types, (Jedi, Hero, Bounty Hunter, Scoundrel, Scavenger, Villain, Dark Side, Astromech Droids, and Protocol Droids.) all of which have their own abilities and uses.

All of these features really make the experience flow a lot smoother and are a perfect 10/10 for me.



TL;DR: buy the game if you've been wanting a decent Lego Star Wars game, things are different for the better, mumble mode is there, and if you get deluxe, you get classic character packs (if nostalgia is your thing) among other misc. character packs. red bricks have been changed into a more easily flowing system, and the combat = good.

Big word of advice: once you're in galaxy mode, buy the rumor for the character ""Grummgar"", complete all the missions to get him and you get to run really ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fast around some of these bigger planets to complete your side quests."

Lego Star Wars I/II/III/Complete Saga were four of my favorite video games as a young lad. I pre-ordered The Skywalker Saga a few days before its release; and at 100 hours of the game played, all 9 episodes completed, and 900 Kyber Bricks collected, I feel I can give an informed review. I will be judging the game on individual metrics, and then I'll give my final score.

Exploration - 10/10
If I could only mention one aspect of this game at exceeded my expectations, it would certainly be the vast galaxy laden with puzzles, side missions, and collectibles. I would hazard a guess that the average player will spend upwards of 200 hours achieving 100% completion of this game. The developers give the player the freedom to explore hub worlds immediately after discovering the planet; this allowed me to take frequent breaks from the episodic story to pursue all of the hidden collectibles throughout the worlds. In my opinion, the most fun part of this game is exploring the hub worlds. It is a completionist's paradise.

Progression - 7/10
I really appreciate when developers put time into erecting a progression system in their game - especially in an open-world genre; this allows players to work towards an eventual goal as they complete missions. In the early game, I looked forward to acquiring faster sprint speeds and stud magnet ranges. Later, I looked closer at the class-specific abilities and started investing in the Bounty Hunter and Dark Jedi. I wasn't expecting much in the way of a progression system from this game and was pleasantly surprised when I learned one was implemented. That said, I can't score the game too highly as I feel that most of the abilities are not particularly impressive. Once I had collected 500 Kyber Bricks, I was able to unlock all of the useful abilities, after which my interest in collecting more Kyber Bricks diminished. I still fully intend on obtaining all 1166, but the short-term rewards are lackluster at this point.

Story - 3/10
I must say the story missions in this game were a chore to play. I started off with the Phantom Menace and quickly learned that the enjoyable part of the game was exploring the hub worlds, not advancing through the tediously scripted missions. I felt like for almost the entire story mode, I was traveling between checkpoints as main characters spouted the dialogue from the movies, switching classes to interact with the same darn button puzzles, or engaging in ""intense"" light-saber combat with the bosses. I was told the combat system in this game was to be more advanced, and while it technically is more complex than the original Lego Star Wars games, the developers gave up on the puzzles integrated with the boss fights. It is simply a slashing fest for five minutes for every boss: Maul, Dooku, Grievous, Anakin, Vader, Sidious, Kylo, etc. In most boss fights, once the boss reaches a certain threshold, they will run away; and it usually takes several minutes to catch up with them. This really breaks the urgency of combat. And this often occurs 2-3 times per boss. The space combat is much more enjoyable as there are no breaks in combat. You simply search and destroy the given targets until the mission is over. Luckily, there are other aspects of this game that make up for the missions' shortcomings.

Movies - 9/10
So glad to see that the wit of Lego games as persisted all of these years. There were many occasions I audibly laughed at the humor throughout the movies in this game. My only complaint is that you cannot access the movies anywhere in the menus. In previous installments, you could purchase and watch the movies in the shop at your leisure. It made it difficult to share funny moments with my friends/family, as I would have to find a clip on YouTube of the scene I was on just to show it.

Performance - 8/10
As this game has just released, I am going to cut it some slack on occasional bugs I encountered throughout playing it. I experienced only one crash in the entire game - when I attempted to equip the Shore Trooper character in my first hour of game play. The only serious bug I repeatedly encountered is the Trade Federation Battleship occupying the center of space battles when it wasn't supposed to be there. It had no substance, so it was still possible to complete the missions. Graphically, the game is beautiful. I never experienced frame drops at 3840/2160p 60hertz. (RTX 3060ti) My one complaint with the graphical settings is the FOV status. I felt way too close to my character throughout this game. I would have appreciated an in-game setting to adjust this.

Overall Rating - 37/50 or 74%
I thoroughly enjoyed exploring the hub worlds in this game, solving all of the puzzles, collecting all of the Kyber Bricks and Data Cards, unlocking all of the characters. To supplement the boredom of the story missions, I listened to Ben Shapiro podcasts while I played with the sound off. I wouldn't say this lives up to the glories of The Complete Saga, but did anyone actually think it could be that good? No, I don't think so. But this game still is a lot of fun a deserves the attention that any Lego Game gets.

Final Recommendations
Start with Episode 7 and unlock the scavenger items as Rey. You get them early on, and multiple puzzles require them to be completed. You don't have to finish episode 7. Just get the gear and jump back to one of the good trilogies. Don't try to 100% every hub world immediately, some Kyber Bricks and Characters can only be obtained after completing a side mission that is started on another planet. Once you've obtained all of the Kyber Bricks visible on the map, you've done all you can do for the time. Also, make sure to check inside interiors on the map. Kyber Bricks do not appear on the tracker until you're in the building."

If you really want it, wait for a sale.

It's been a while since I played a lego game so maybe it's the nostalgia talking, but there seems to be something (or multiple somethings) missing from this installment. While a lot of new ideas were tried, it seems to have come at the cost of enjoyable content and 'real' gameplay.

The worlds, while detailed, personally feel to lack some charm in previous titles and instead feel designed to maximize the time it takes to do anything to pad the game. Many world objects that I believe would have been 'lego based' in older games have been rendered realistically/geometrically to the point that in some areas the characters themselves are the only lego objects on screen.

The move to voiced characters has also led to a fall off in cutscene quality. Whereas in the past they were very expressive and creative in getting across the plot, now much of it is just through dialogue. I do appreciate however that they allow the option to return to the classic 'mumble voice' mode.

Finally the difficulty seems far too easy. I know this is a childrens game so I'm not expecting dark souls but it is literally almost impossible to die even without any upgrades equipped, especially in the space battles. This lack of a challenge has made many of the fights a bore and something I'm forcing myself to push through. Additionally, there is no requirement to play the levels with the 'intended' characters. Instead you're able to select any character you want even on the first playthrough of the level (making freeplay near pointless and many levels very easy to break/make even easier).

I really wanted to like this game, but so far I've been unimpressed. However I do plan to finish it and hopefully will have my mind changed by the end."

The hardest part of writing this review has been not playing the game long enough to write it. That doesn’t normally happen with me, I’m a big fan of having my fill of a game, penning a review, and moving on. But not this time. The Skywalker Saga is a perfect mix of immensely engaging and endlessly sprawling, a game that can ask me to do the same thing at hour 60 that it asks at hour 1 and I agree to it eagerly. It breaks a surprising amount of ground for a Star Wars game, and also remains fun and light-hearted enough that you’ll never really tire of it. And not even the technical issues can mar my enjoyment of this massive adventure.

“The Skywalker Saga” refers to the nine mainline Star Wars movies that chronicle the rise, fall, and legacy of Darth Vader. From the lakes of Naboo to the sands of Tatooine, and all the way to the blasted surface of Exegol, you can play through all of the big beats of the Star Wars films. But unlike previous LEGO games, this isn’t so neatly broken up into stages. Each episode has five story missions, but they’re stitched together through open-world exploration across 28 planets seen in the movies, often with scripted events and cutscenes to fill in the gaps between missions. You’ll fly the trench run, battle the Separatist leaders, and take down Starkiller base, but you’ll also defrost Rebels at Echo Base, serve up orders at the diner on Coruscant, and rummage through Maz Kanata’s castle. And if you can believe it, playing through the events of the films is only the start of your journey.

As far as a retelling of the Star Wars epic, the LEGO version hits all the right notes. It sometimes picks some unexpected moments to turn into missions, like Yoda’s battle with the droid armies on Kashyyyk or Princess Leia running around on the Tantive IV, but always turns these into fun romps. The open-world segments are also plenty of fun and do a lot to round out the story, taking you through notable events while also leaving you free to roam for cash and collectibles. Missions contain plenty of variety, including space battles, large army clashes, on-rails shooting sequences, and more. Even the normal on-foot adventuring gets mixed up with multiple teams doing things at once and branching paths. Most notably, climactic battles with characters like Darth Vader and Kylo Ren have been given a ton of attention, becoming multi-stage challenges with all sorts of dodging, blocking, and combo mechanics that echo the boss battles of more… severe games.

As fun as playing through the movies is, the cutscenes and dialogue are a huge part of what makes this game so fun. LEGO has really made a name for itself with licensed properties by parodying them without losing their core appeal, and that’s more evident than ever here. Cutscenes are always hilariously slapstick, the major characters all have their own running jokes that get used to great effect over the course of nine episodes, and even the most dramatic scenes get broken down into comedic beats. The big climax to Episode I against Darth Maul had me in tears with how funny it was, for example. You’ll see plenty of that cleverness with every mission and dialogue from random NPCs, too, and the fact that LEGO Star Wars never lets that air of wacky hijinks falter goes a long way towards keeping the game fresh.

Fresh is what you need this to be, too, because the real meat of the game is collecting things. There is a staggering, unconscionable amount of things to find here, between the 380 characters, 100+ ships, dozens of quests and challenges, and more. New to this LEGO outing is the chance to upgrade the abilities of your characters, who are split across about ten different classes. You need kyber bricks for these upgrades, of which there are over 1100 scattered all over the galaxy. The challenges to obtain them range from looking behind corners to planet-hopping odysseys that end in hidden boss battles. Side quests can also be impressively involved, spanning land and space, and throwing you into all kinds of battles and hunts. You can even capture certain capital ships, which essentially turn into secret stages with their own unique events and mechanics.

There’s so much to see and do in The Skywalker Saga, it’s easy to lose sight of what may be this game’s greatest achievement and biggest appeal. This is essentially the first open-world Star Wars game, offering you the chance to freely wander any of the planets and notable locales of the films at your leisure. Sure, you’ve got characters to unlock and collectibles to hunt down all over, but I cannot overstate how magical it is to simply touch down on Coruscant or Kamino or Bespin or Takodana and just be there. The folks who made this game went to incredible lengths to make every location feel like a real place, with beautiful, realistic environments and effects. They meshed this immersion perfectly with their LEGO characters and objects, too, because your bricks and figures look absolutely life-like with plastic seams, reflections, and even sand and dirt caking their surfaces on some worlds.

It’s worth noting there are a fair number of technical issues at the moment, ones that may or may not get sorted out via patches. I’ve had to reload the game a few times because of explosions or textures not rendering correctly. One of the instanced space battle areas is aligned around a background model that can make it really hard to see. Most importantly, there can be crashes from time to time, including one consistent one during an Episode III mission that I had to turn my graphics settings all the way down to get around. Surprisingly, that had little impact on how the game looked, so this one seems both extremely well-optimized and also rather unstable. I’ll also add that I haven’t really lost any progress to crashes, because the game is saving constantly, but it’s definitely an annoyance.

With that out of the way, I really have nothing but love for this one. If nothing else I’ve said in this review has sold you on The Skywalker Saga, let me say this: I have never really liked the LEGO games, not even the Star Wars ones. I’ve played several in the past, but never stuck with any of them for more than a few hours, owing to hollow, simple gameplay and tedious collecting. In stark contrast to that, I am absolutely obsessed with this one. It’s crowded out all my other games, drawing me back day after day to hunt more kyber bricks and character unlocks. Above all, it’s just fun. It never forgets how light-hearted and charming it is, and everything it offers the player is there to help you enjoy it even more. This is the Star Wars game I’ve been waiting decades for, an open-world romp that does everything it can to make you enjoy your time in a vast galaxy of adventure.

~OVERALL RATING~
70%

~ SUMMARY ~
It's a reasonably fun game that does a fantastic job capturing the key story elements from all 9 movies. It's actually amazing at how it does it - you'd expect that turning the movies into games would mean each game would be 20 hours each, but somehow they packed it all in and still made it fun. I took 22h to complete the core game, doing minimum side quests, and finished all 9 episodes in that time so it's only a bit longer than watching the movies themselves.

It's just not quite deep enough for my tastes. The lightweight, whimsical style of LEGO and the fairly simple gameplay and skill tree just didn't do that much for me. It's perfect as a kids game though, and there is a vast amount of content to explore. I reckon I touched 40% of the total game - there are huge amounts of collectables and areas to explore that I just skipped right past.

The art, music, sound and production are spectacular though - this game is a finely crafted masterpiece. It's really just the overall feel of it that didn't do it for me.

Pros
+ Good Voice acting (though OT and sequels can dip in quality/effort)
+ Fleshed out combat compared to other Lego games
+ Content amount (all 9 movies)
+ Graphics range from nice to amazing
+ Music is great (but could have included more original songs)
+ Amazing sound design
+ Humour for kids and adults

Neutral
> Pacing is very fast
> Missions are quite short
> Pretty easy in terms of difficulty
> no online co-op but can use steam remote play

Cons
- Enemy and ally AI is surprisingly dumb most of the time
- Getting 100% can feel very tedious
- minor bugs here and there
- infrequent frame drops (maybe due to splitscreen)
- missions barely have any puzzles
- no official online co-op
- almost no variation in boss battles

The Force is strong with this one.
A long time ago, the announcement of LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga got me excited, making it one of my most anticipated titles, but its constant delays made it clear that my galaxy’s visit is still far, far away…

Yet, I remained so patient that even Yoda blissfully shivered from my accomplishment.

Was it worth the wait? Absolutely.

By portraying all three trilogies, The Skywalker Saga provides a coherent, entertaining storyline filled with humorous twists and quips that never become boring. Truly. Not only that it feels like a complete, parodying recreation, but it also comes up with its own jabs that even make fun of some of the decisions made in each instalment; thus, even horrendous episodes like or are enjoyable. Moreover, it inspires itself by the popular memes, which is a nice touch as it underlines its dedication to the fandom.

Due to that, it caters to the fans rather than to everyone—and that is fine. Could you enjoy it without being familiar with the films? Probably, as the game still has a lot to offer, but many jokes might fly over your head at lightspeed. I am glad that it is like that, though, as it would lose part of its charm otherwise.

The way you experience the campaign is a bit different this time; it lets you galavant through the galaxy and visit numerous planets, with an occasional unique mission here and there. Thus, it feels like a thorough, delightful journey rather than a bland list of levels, making the whole adventure more satisfactory.

As it is an action-adventure title – from a tighter third-person perspective this time – the usual gameplay loop revolves around exploring, platforming, hoarding all the collectables and, of course, fighting. When you are not directly following the story, you can just venture away and explore the universe on your own. However, do not expect a seamless open world; instead, it consists of a bunch of playable areas in each system. I would say it is better that way because the locations are designed with care to provide just enough content without overwhelming you.

Apart from relaxing sightseeing, there are the said collectables to find; picking them up is not pointless, though, as you use them to upgrade your characters’ abilities or unlock additional, hilarious rewards, like a fierce Porg companion or baguettes that replace the lightsabers. To obtain them, you usually have to solve a simple environmental puzzle. Even though that might get a bit repetitive after a while, I did not mind it because I adored discovering new locations and trying out other iconic characters.

Speaking of those, you can unlock them, along with starships, by completing side missions. These quests often tend to deliver an even more over-the-top take on . At one point, you might find yourself smuggling trampolines to Mustafar, ending it with a bouncy fight against Bossk, or you could be crushing down a revolt of cloned woolamanaders – who are essentially cute blue apes – on the Kamino facility. This kind of content serves as a sweet, optional stuffing that can spice up your journey.

That leads us to the combat, which surprisingly has a lot of depth when compared to an average game. For sure, it is still pretty effortless, so do not expect any hardships or obstacles in your way. There are, however, several possibilities to use, as apart from mashing one button, you can engage in various combos that make encounters more fun and satisfying to observe. Whether you viciously slice through a bunch of Clones with Maul’s double-bladed lightsaber, blast everyone’s heads off with Boba Fett’s carbine rifle, or slap others as C-3PO, you know it is going to be a joyful time. And if that does not convince you, then undulating around as Mamma the Hutt, licking everyone in the process, should do so!

These differences do not only influence the combat but the overall interaction with the world, as well. Where a Jedi will take advantage of their agile movement or the Force, a bounty hunter will rely on a jetpack and grappling hook; due to that, the character classes complement each other. It is a simple yet effective system that pushes you to try out more of the iconic heroes or villains.

Unfortunately, the skirmishes in space are disappointing, though serviceable for what they are. While there is a decent variety of starships to choose from, the combat lacks the complexity of the ground one. You only have one attack option, with the possibility of unleashing a homing missile, and that is it. Thus, all of these encounters are bland and uninspiring, becoming boring later on. The exceptions are a few main missions or battles with capital ships, which at least offer unique objectives that balance out the monotonous gameplay.

Additionally, the absence of online cooperative play is saddening. Even though you can use , it is not enough, mainly because every progress made counts only for the host while your friends gain nothing. That is weird and discouraging, as you suddenly cannot use the characters and abilities you unlocked but rely purely on your friend’s ones. Also, doing all the collectables twice does not sound that appealing either.

Where beautifully shines is its audiovisual presentation. Simply put, it is top-notch. All the planets with their iconic locations are glamorous to lie your eyes on, and all the ships, even the capital ones or Death Star itself, are made purely of bricks, which nicely distinguish them from the rest of the environment. Just galavanting through the deserts of Tatooine or the city of Theed, listening to its iconic themes is heartwarming.

Another nice touch is the presence of some of the original trilogy’s actors, who reprise their roles, like as C-3PO or as Lando. You can also hear a few familiar voices from the animated show. Naturally, not everyone could be present, but the attempt still shows the dedication put into this project. Moreover, the number of additional monologues and even dialogues between numerous characters is astonishing; even Darth Vader and Kylo Ren have their small talk, and at times, they might even perform an amusing animation when you let them stand in place for a while. The love and care just jump at you at every bricky corner you pass by.

That would be perhaps the best summary for .

Overall, I adore this title, as it is a special experience that managed to awake an inner child in me, a kid that enjoyed watching the films over and over again. The humorous nature and relaxing gameplay make for an excellent combination. Yes, some aspects could have been a tad bit better; however, that does not take away the dozens of hours of fun I had. Thus, I can wholeheartedly recommend it to any enthusiast.

Now excuse me; I still have a few collectables to find."

If you havent heard the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise then this is where you are going to hear it."

Hello there!

When I heard there was gonna be a remake of Lego Star Wars Ep's 1-6 with the added bonus of those things we'd all like to forget about called Ep's 7-9, I was pretty excited about the announcement as a huge Star Wars fan and thought long and hard whether I should pre order this game or not.

The old Lego Star Wars games from the PS2/Xbox/Gamcube era (and later Xbox 360, PS3, and Wii with the Complete Saga) were a thing of beauty and kind of helped Lego kick off their long running series of Lego themed games ranging from Indiana Jones, to Harry Potter, to Marvel and DC super heroes.

Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga now allows us to experience the entirety of the Star Wars series again in Lego form and fully voice acted too which the old games didnt feature. The voice acting is just the 1st major change for this game. Along with this the combat has been changed up to feel more hack and slashey with lightsabers, and more third person shooter like with blasters, a major step up from the old games.

You can now freely move the camera around and access most of the games features from the select menu without ever having to return back to a central hub area like in the older games. There's side missions you can do to gain more studs and hidden collectibles to find again scattered throught the episodes. You now have the new Kyber bricks collectible which helps you level up your character abilities and powers. This game also contains the largest collection of Star Wars characters and vehicles available to play as spanning all 9 episodes and even The Mandalorian and Solo if you have the DLCs with more characters being added soon. The graphics are also very pretty and look good no matter what graphics settings, and can run well on some older hardware like GTX 10 series GPUs.

Some other upsides of the remake are the almost seamless transitions from world to world when going through levels (with some slight technical hiccups here and there, but I'll get to that later). You can enable silly extra options like ""mumble mode"" to make the characters sound the way they did in the original games or alter the gameplay for a good laugh. The Skywalker Saga also pays pretty good respect to the original films, keeping a lot of memorable lines from the movies for important moments of the story, while sometimes sprinkling in the Lego goofiness for laughs. The game is also not difficult to play compared to the original games, which makes it more welcoming to younger audiences and casuals who are Star Wars fans, but aint big on gaming. For me personally, the easier difficulty of the game wasnt to my liking, but with this being a family friendly Star Wars game, I can understand why this was done.

Now onto the downsides. While I like the game so far and feel satisfied with it as a Star Wars fan and a gamer, I am disappointed with the way some moments of the story were cut out, probably due to time constraints, or shortened by just having certain characters or locations show up at parts of the story they werent supposed to be in yet (eg. Yoda explaining Kamino being gone from the archives to Obi Wan in the Library and never showing the part with the younglings wisdom and the cool space map in the training room), but again this can be understood in order to cram 9 movie stories into 1 game. Still, the games progression through episodes feels too quick and it doesnt help that intense action filled moments dont happen frequently like in the old games, and leads to moments where you just walk from point A to point B with little to no resistance only to activate the next cutscene.

The game also has some bugs and glitches that can lead to soft locks that require a restart. Had my game soft lock on me 3 times when trying to start a mission or go into a cutscene and had to restart. Had a glitch when trying to buy Zam Wesell from the in game shop where my studs would be spent but Zam still showed up as not having been bought. I had another odd glitch where side missions in spaces just wouldnt show up and I was flying in empty space, I could only see the story mission icon and the blue asteroid thing floating by.

In the droid factory level for episode 2 the games fps plunges as low as 28 fps at times on areas where theres a lot of machinery and enemies moving on screen. Also one thing that annoys me is that every time I restart or tab out of the game it never saves my resolution settings and always sets me to 1080p 50 fps every time, had to play on fullscreen mode for this game too because trying to use windowed borderless after restarting will just put you in windowed only and cant be fixed unless you switch from fullscreen back to windowed borderless.

Personally, I like the game and recommend it to any Star Wars fan for episodes 1-6 remade alone (7-9 will always be a mistakes barfed up by Disney's lousy writers), but I'd wait a while to buy this on sale for $20-30 at the most, the gameplay and pace of the game don't warrant $50, or $60 with the deluxe edition. Unless your a hardcore Star Wars fan like me, wait for a sale."

This isn't a bad game, not really. But when you stack it up against its 15-year-old predecessor, it comes a bit short.

Sure, you technically have MORE content. But, personally, I find it hard to consider repeating the same exact puzzles on every planet, the same exact fetch quests with different names, and the same exact on-rails ""levels"" as meaningful content.

Let's actually talk about the levels for a bit. When you get to an *actual* level in the game (say, the first mission in The Force Awakens, the Canto Bight prison break in The Last Jedi, or the escape from the Death Star in A New Hope), they're surprisingly open, have relatively clever puzzles, and come across as a pleasantly surprising update to a 15 year old formula. Unfortunately, these moments are far and few between. Most levels are either boss fights that follow the exact same formula of spam attack until the boss runs off, immunity phase, repeat; and on-rails vehicle segments that all function exactly the same, with the only difference being the ship you're piloting. This would be less of an issue if these were, say, 1 per episode like in The Complete Saga. Instead, you have issues like Revenge of the Sith being almost entirely boss fights with only one (Droid Attack on the Wookies) and a half (the first 1/2 of Down for the Count) being *actual* levels. instead of 6 levels per episode, now you only get 5 - and most of them are exactly the same. The other segments of the films that could have been (and in the past, *were*) levels are now relegated to painfully dull, pace-killing walking simulator segments, in which you spend 5 minutes walking to a location/character to listen to some dialogue or watch a cutscene, and then repeat until you get to one of the 5 actual levels.

The majority of the work in this game went to the open world, which - while visually impressive - lacks any sort of substance. As mentioned before, all the side quests and puzzles are carbon copies of one another, rendering them repetitive and borderline pointless. Yes, objectively speaking, 700+ puzzles is more than The Complete Saga or The Clone Wars had, but does the total amount matter if only about 100 are unique?

A similar issue exists with the characters. Wow, over 1,000 characters with more on the way in the form of DLC! Unfortunately, they almost all function exactly the same - and most don't even have voice acting. This is something I really don't care about (IMO the LEGO games were better when they didn't have voiceovers), but, at the same time, if you're going to have VO, then at least apply it consistently. Even characters who have voice acting will lose it if you elect to use certain skins instead of the default. Again, does having ""more"" matter when it's done in such a half-baked way?

Finally, there is no end to the technical issues that mar this game. Six months after release and performance issues still plague certain levels. To TT's credit, they did fix these issues somewhat - ""Better Call Maul"" went from literally unplayable for me to actually running at a consistent framerate after patches - but the performance hits are still apparent in areas such as the Droid Factory. This points to underlying engine and optimization issues, which - unfortunately - are not so fixable. Additionally, bugs crop up left and right: things as simple as audio getting stuck and constantly looping, to things much more gamebreaking as not being able to lift Force objects. There are bugs tied to acquiring collectibles that actively prevent the player from getting 100% completion. One side quest in particular has a bug where you have to specifically quit to the main menu in order to get it to advance. If you go somewhere else in-game or ALT-F4, it simply will not progress. The latter two problems have been known issues since the game's launch; neither have been fixed. With the release of the Galactic Edition (and the questionable DLC practices that came with it), the chances of these issues ever being fixed has decreased from slim to none.

So, final verdict: if you love Star Wars, and love LEGO games, and don't mind uninspired, repetitive content or just want a game to keep you or a kid busy for the next several months, then this is by all means a fine game. If you're looking for a worthy update or successor to The Complete Saga or even other, newer LEGO games, this isn't it. Personally, if you have a choice between The Complete Saga and this game, I'd go with the former every single time. That's not nostalgia talking, it's just simply a better, more technically polished game in spite of its age."

Am I satisfied with my purchase? Yes. Overall the game is a fantastically fun romp through everyone's favorite fictional space epic about destroying each other over politics with lasers. Tons of stuff to do and see, its a good time. Would I recommend 100%ing it like I just finished doing?

NO.

The blessing, but also massive problem with 100%ing a game and playing it for so long is you see everything the game has to offer, and I mean EVERYTHING. Sure while I saw every character, every joke, every reference, every unlock, I also saw every glitch, every bug, every cut or rushed corner or idea. Every repetitive nonsense, every boring game moment. I physically recoiled in my chair every time I was forced into 3, brain dead difficulty dogfights every time I just wanted to transport cargo through ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hyperspace. Around the 70% mark the game had already become very painful to digest, but I stuck it out just so my ape brain could see the sticker on my steam profile and the infinite shower of coins you get as a 100% bonus despite the fact that money has no value after you've 100%ed the game.
(Also by the way the last challenge that stood in my path to 100% was bugged, and I had to replay the level 13 times before It randomly worked by accident that last time. I will murder Kylo Ren with a snowman.)

The story missions are quite abridged, fast forwarded and simplified if you will, which really sucks if you are a person who genuinely cares about the story and wouldn't mind being retold it again in detail. It stings a bit when even the quiet reflective and powerful scenes from the movies are cut short or played completely for laughs. The real meat and potatoes of the game is through exploring all of the different planets, or at least the planets that the poor time crunched devs had time to finish, looking at you Kijimi.

Overall if you pick up and play the game it will be a good time and worth the money, but the second you start to reach deeper you soon realize that the Skywalker Saga puddle is actually quite shallow and rough around the edges.

Still the best Lego Game since the Wii era of Lego games though. Over all 7/10, not enough Watto."

Fun game that, like with other LEGO games, is fairly casual and enjoyable for people of all ages. The mini-open world aspect is very cool too. Combat is fun enough to make the game interesting. Story is obviously a dumbed-down version of the films but has a lot of prequel memes which is always good.

If you were buying a LEGO game and expecting some sort of Dark Souls-level of difficulty then you probably won't like it. But if you've ragequit Elden Ring for the 20th time and just want some low-key fun then you'll love it."

the smuggle mission are way too many and way to repetive, the loading screens are really annoying when you have to go back and forth for most mission. It was a little torture completing the game, fun fact the 100% speedrun is about 25 hours, it took me playing relatively casually about 80.

Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not. It’s not a story the Jedi would tell you. It’s a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life… He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself"

I'll be honest, kinda underwhelmed.
I was uber hype for the game during development, even after the delays, because I grew up playing Lego games with my brothers, and I was more than ready to play this supposed ""ultimate Lego Star Wars"" when it dropped.
Unfortunately, after months of not touching the game, I just haven't been able to bring myself to keep playing past Episode 1, and even completing that single episode felt like a chore more than a game.

PROS:
-Amazing and dynamic graphics and cinimatics
-Faithful, yet humorous take on the Star Wars film plots, as is par-for-the-course in Lego games
-Large open world(s) to explore and find collectables
-Lightsaber combat is fun
-That Darth Maul fight was absolutely GLORIOUS
-A leveling/powering up system that incentivizes finding Kyber bricks
-Funny back-and-forth interactions between the characters you choose
(one of my favorites: Young Anakin: ""That's a cool suit! Where can I get one?"" Darth Vader: ""Patience, child. Patience"")

CONS:
- Walking. a LOT of walking.
This isn't even a joke, about 60% of episode one consists of traveling between locations where nothing happens (except some dialogue if you're lucky) and you can't fast travel to speed things up. As an added bonus, if there's characters talking, you are slowed to an absolute CRAWL for the duration of the area in order to avoid skipping any dialogue.

- The aforementioned saber combat, while fun, is uncommon, at least if you're following the ""story mode""

- Blaster combat, while having a nice, over-the-shoulder playstyle, feels clunky and monotonous. (more of a personal nitpick i guess)

- Starfighter combat is janky, slow, and repetitive. I found myself many times asking ""Wait, another wave of enemies?"" as i slowly steered my fighter to shoot the barely-moving fighters. Easily one of the most disappointing parts of the game, especially considering how the fighter combat in the Lego The Force Awakens game worked.

- The mind-boggling amount of the EXACT same puzzle with little-to-no variation ( batteries, platforming, more batteries, character panel, and EVEN MORE BATTERIES)

- The way you unlock characters outside of the story (glorified fetch-quests of talking to the right people) is very, very annoying and not at all rewarding to pull off when you finally find the right joker to ask about the character you want.
Heck, it's hardly worth the hunt because all characters are basically just reskins of the same handful of classes (Jedi, hero, astromech, etc) with no gameplay variance between them.

- The sheer quantity of the kyber bricks being kinda just spat all over the world, not in any really clever ways with cool puzzles or sequences like old lego games did, just in a ""oh, didn't think one would be here"" kinda way.
The most ""unusual"" puzzle (if you can even call it that) that I remember from my playthrough of Episode 1 consisted of rebuilding pipes to fill tanks with water on Tatooine and, despite being the most ""unique"" puzzle I encountered, was by far and away the most monotonous, boring, and frustratingly slow sequence of events and took a good 10 minutes, not from difficulty (it only gave you the pieces you need at a time, so a bit hard to mess up), but from the sheer length of the ""challenge"". The reward? A single kyber brick. SO fuggin worth my time...

- ""Actual"" levels don't really feel unique or special, usually feeling like an extension of the open world area (and not in a good way. It kinda feels like ""Oh wait, that was a level I just did? all i did was WALK do a hero panel and shoot 3 droids""


TL:DR-
Once my nostalgia-tinted glasses were taken off, I was left with a monotonous, boring, repetitive, aimless, wannabe Lego Star Wars game that, while it it has some good stuff to work with and matches today's standards of graphics, feels incomplete or unfinished gameplay-wise.
A real shame. At least we have The Complete Saga still which, I might add, still holds up today, at least in my mind. Go check it out instead of The Skywalker Saga. You won't be sorry."

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
This is one of the few games that are worth buying on early access unlike those that get ditched by the devs once they milk their product enough. Slime Rancher will appeal to the audience that like to play and relax on their games. With so many games out there that make us frustrated, angry and anxious, Slime Rancher tries to oppose those feelings, and to me, it succeeds easily. My only complaint about this game is the lack of content, but considering it's early access, and that the devs are still updating the game, more content will be added in the future.
Overall, I recommend this game to all my fellow gamers that are bored of being competitive and anxious all the time and that just want to have fun just like the old days!"

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
First of all, you may look at this and see a kids game. Cutesy characters, no BFG to frag tight corridors full of baddies. But sit down and give this game 15 Minutes and you will see why I am recommending it.

Without giving anything away, you are a slime rancher on a distant planet and you collect plorps (which are slime poo) and trade it within the global economy. You can coop and breed chickens as well as farm a wide variety of fruits and vegetables. Each slime has a favorite food item that doubles plorp production and keeps those little bastards happy. You can cross breed the slimes for a multi plorp income, but you must becareful. If they are cross bred more than once they turn into tars, which basically go on a rampage and kill all the slimes and warp them into evil tars.

You got upgrades, unlockable areas, beautiful immersive world with a back story you find in notes left behind.

It is a genuinely fun game, and guess what? It's early access, AND the developers are updating constantly with completely new and interesting material. New slimes, sections of the world, buildable items, gear, etc.

I give this game 90% and 10% only because it isn't finished yet so it is not a complete product, although it totally feels like one. (30+ hours content so far, Played offline a bit as well)

Enjoy this game, cause I sure did.

I highly recommend it.

Slime Rancher [EARLY ACCESS] Review

I caught a first glimpse of this game when one of my steam friends posted a link about it on the activity feed. I checked the game out briefly, but quickly went back to other stuff as it did not really peek my interest. The game seemed a little bit weird to me (as in: it looks boring and stupid) and I was about sure I wouldn't enjoy it. About a week later, I saw one of my favourite youtubers play it and decided to eventually give it a watch. The video was over before I knew it and I clicked on the next one. And the next. After a while it was clear to me: I want this game! NOW! There was just something about it that I can't really describe, but it drew me in. And a lot of other people got drawn in too. It's like a disease being spread, the only difference being that it's a good disease. I admit I've been a little bit too quick in my (wrongful) judging of this game, and will therefore give it a (fair) second chance in this review.

You play as Beatrix LeBeau who decides to leave earth and set out for the ; a magical and adorable planet filled with slimes! Your goal? Finding slimes to Suck up their plorts (aka slime poop) with your VAC to ... sell them! Yes, correct. Plorts come in many forms and are used for various things on earth; mainly food and products (eww!). You sell these plorts on the plort market to earn some cash, which can then be spend on upgrades (for either yourself or the ranch). When slimes are fed, they'll leave one of these treasures behind for you, or two even if you are lucky. As of now, there are 3 main categories of food: fruits, veggies and meat. Each category has different types of food for you to find and feed to your slimes. If you so desire, you can also plant your own food - you'll run out less slowly (and it's fun too!). Believe me, your slimey friends will be thankful if you do. It is especially useful to plant your friends' favourite food; they'll love you for that and will definitely return the favour via plorts! I hope it is now clear that plorts are extremely valuable and so is your task as slime rancher.

The gameplay, however a bit unoriginal (find slimes --> feed slimes --> get plorts --> get money --> get upgrades etc) is very satisfying. Finding new slimes is always exciting, especially since you can create mixed breeds that are more efficient for money making (and they are just so adorable too!). The game thus encourages you to explore the planet on your 'quest' to find more and different slimes, find food and start your own farms ... and getting upgrades will make all of that easier. Be careful though, not everything is peaceful on the . Under certain circumstances, a Tarr slime will come out and devour all the slimes in the vicinity - even you! So be cautious and take good care of your 'pets'!

The 'thing' that makes Slime Rancher so much fun for me, is the fact that there is so much freedom as to how you play. You can approach this game in a very casual way, and just go on an adventure, enjoying the different and beautiful areas with their inhabitant slimes (I could see this game used for therapy so to speak). The total opposite would be finding the most profitable slimes, combining them, putting them in a corral and making a lot of money - a dream for people who want to create a very efficient farm (or ranch rather). Or you could go inbetween and do a little of both: enjoy the slimes in their natural surroundings, but take a few home to take care of because they're so darn cute! The game is also suited for all ages, which is great. I'm pretty sure both young and old will find a certain joy playing this game and I love it for that. I could totally see a grandfather and his grandchild play this game together having a lot of fun.

The game in its current state is already super fun and stable, with minimal bugs. I estimate about 5-10 hours of content. There is still a lot of content waiting to be added, like more slimes, more types of food, more areas ... more everything! I also hope that they will add different 'modes' besides the ""do-whatever-you-want"" experience. I think it would make for much more replayability, which is what I'm looking for in the long run. I want to be able to play this cute game for a long time, without it getting tedious, hence my idea for different modes. (Ofcourse, this list is totally personal, and I will still love this game if it keeps up development like this - whether there be different modes or not). I'm thinking about:





+ Unique concept
+ Relaxing and/or challenging
+ Nice, soothing soundtrack
+ Satisfying gameplay
+ Excellent tutorial
+ Gorgeous looking world
+ Cuteness overload!

+- (this is temporary): lack of content
+- (this is temporary): some may find it a little bit too expensive in its current state
- The gameplay is not very innovative (as in: get slimes -> get money -> get upgrades -- repeat)



I definitely recommend this game, but please keep in mind that it is still early access. Not all the content is in the game yet, and weird stuff (buggs) may happen. If you don't mind that, by all means, please support the devs. Otherwise, just wait a couple of months for the game to be a little bit more polished."

Here is a game for everyone:

- The vegetarian: Expand the appetites of meat-loving slimes by combining them with fruit or vegetable-loving slimes. Let those chickens run free where they belong!

alternatively...

- The vegetable hater: Shoot those carrots as far as you can into the Slime Sea, or throw that oca oca right into the incinerator. That'll teach 'em. Chicken every day.

- The sadist: Round up all those cute little slimes and smile as you send them streaming into the incinerator. Also, shoot a Rad plort into your Pink Boom Largo slimes' corral and sit back to watch the slaughter. You sick psycho.

- The manager: Take care of every aspect of your ranch, plant crops, do slime research, buy upgrades, plan your Largo combos, establish a routine. Beware the Quantum slimes.

- The ""cute"" lover: Tabby Honey Largos. Actually, don't even bother to finish reading this, just buy the game already.

- The sports gamer: At some point in the game you can buy a slime gadget called the Slime Hoop. Yep, you can play basketball, and the slimes are the balls. Once you get your inventory size to 50 per slot, you can literally shoot hundreds of free-throws in less than a minute. (Do not try this at your ranch. Be far away. Far. Away.)

- The kids: It's fun, adventurous, no blood, no cursing, your ""gun"" doesn't shoot bullets (though I once nailed a Rock slime with a Pogofruit and sent it flying off a cliff - in my defense, it was standing on the edge, but the smile on its face as it sailed to its doom broke my heart).

- Parents: Watch your fruit-loving slimes throw a tantrum at dinner when they refuse to eat their veggies you spent your valuable time collecting just for them. Ungrateful brats.

- The ""I really need a break"" guy/gal: Say no more. Lose yourself in amusing and being amused by very lovable slimes. Their needs are now yours. Feel the satisfaction as they smile at you after being fed. Explore the beautiful and sometimes mysterious world around you. Just 5 more minutes.

- The Treasure Hunter: You'll find spherical chests across the world containing upgrades and customizations for your ranch. Can you find them all?

- The businessman/woman: Round up the cattle. Feed them. Collect the product. Watch the stock market. Cash in. Get rich. Repeat.


You will enjoy it regardless.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Slime Rancher is a cute casual game in which you roleplay Beatrix LaBeau, an intrepid rancher who travels to the Far Far Range with the idea of making tons of spacebucks by herding slimes and collecting their plorts.

So what are plorts? Well... it's what slimes do when they gorge themselves on tasty food provided by the environment or by yours truly. Ok, I will stop beating around the bush and say it - it's slime poop that various corporations buy from you to turn into different products. So pretty much everything in this game revolves around poop, and while that might be offensive to some people, never forget that humanity is very much based on poop - mainly because we breathe the stuff that the trees across the world poop every second. Who needs that worthless oxygen when all the good stuff is carbon-based :D

So, let's see what this game does well and what poorly.

THE GOOD:

1. An extremely relaxing, non-invasive music that perfectly fits the atmospehere.
2. The game gives you this zen feeling that makes you wonder just when did those 2-3 hours pass while you were having heaps of fun.
3. The world is cartoonish and quite pleasant to look at.
4. A good amount of areas for you to explore, and way more to come, with a few of them already programmed, but not yet populated and unlocked.
5. Adorable slimes of different colors for you to herd, feed and even cross-breed, making all kinds of cute sounds that easily put a smile on your face.
6. Casual gameplay that is extremely easy to pick up and just have fun.
7. You cannot lose the game - which is a great touch for a fun casual game.
8. Exploration is very rewarding, with many hidden areas for you to discover.
9. A rather big and expansive ranch at this stage of developent with plenty of building spots for corals, ponds, chicken coops or gardens.
10. Cross-breeding slimes is totally doable and gives you different outcomes with new animations and needs that add another level of cuteness to the game.
11. Early access done right - I can foresee this game getting glowing recommendations by everyone. That's how you do early access - you pack your game with a good amount of content, provide an engaging gameplay and then ship it to steam.
12. Tons of achievements for you to unlock and strive for.
13. Jetpacks: intrepid explorers can even use them to get to locked areas or places the developers never intended you to go, which is always fun.
14. Controller support is available, should you choose to play with one.

Ok, now let's take a look at the BAD:

1. While the ranch is big, the plots at this point of development are in fixed locations, which may be off-putting to people who want to squeeze max effectiveness.
2. While the ranch is big, the plots are ultimately not enough if you want to have every slime type and subsequently, cross-breed of slime in the game and the food needed to feed them.
3. There is no story to speak of, and even if not really necessay in my opinion, may turn a few people off the game.
4. At this stage of development, you will be looking at about 10 hours of gameplay to do everything and finish the content.
5. A price tag that is off-putting - the game costs 20€ for me, and while I am 100% sure that I will get my value for the money, it's too much for a good number of people - both for financial reasons, or because it's still an early access, and pledging 20€ to an early access game is always a risk.
6. No steam cloud yet - so if you happen to be using two separate PC's to play Slime Rancher (like me, but I only discovered it today), you need to manually transfer your saves for now. Hopefully it will be resolved in the future.

THE CONCLUSION:
I wholeheartedly recommend this game to everyone who enjoys cute open-end games with decend amount of exploration that promote casual gameplay and put a smile on your face. The amount of content and the adorable world you are put in at start are part of the strong selling points to this game. What sets it back for now is the limited amount of plots to build in order to enjoy the full experience and the number of locked areas with an ""under construction"" sign, which you need to wait for a bit to get populated.

To me, even at the current price tag, Slime Rancher is a good purchase. You can't put value on good feelings and smiles, and anything or anyone (!) who lets you have them in throves, is priceless :)"

This game helps me cope with my depression. It's such a sweet and wholesome experience, and I love just hanging out with groups of wild slimes and watching them jump around. I recommend it for anyone who wants something chill and happy. The slime variety is good and I love making hybrids. The devs are attentive and do update frequently, as well as including fun events where you can get rare items! Also love the music, especially the song that plays in the credits.

If there was one thing I could add, it would be the ability to interact more with slimes in the original game, like in the VR version. I would kill to pet a tabby slime.

It totally is deserving of full price and more, I can tell a lot of love went into this creation."

I stand by everything I said even 2 years later. Adore the game for what it is: a lighthearted, beautiful romp into a silly farming simulator. Then again, I also adore the Rune Factory franchise, so its really a matter of taste.

Now why do I like it you might ask? Well theres 5 things in particular I liked.

1) Its fun to make a farm and get money. Its been fun for ages actually, oddly enough. Ever since Harvest Moon, and then to Rune factory, I've liked the whole farming/economy simulator type games. Were they a bit repetive? Yup. Did they manage to let me unwind and work at regular challenges and tasks? Yes, and as odd as it sounds its quite fun.

2) The game is adorable. They have a cat slime. That you can mutate with several other genus (?) of slimes. That also somehow makes them larger. Why is that? Because its adorable, thats why. And the cat slime isn't even the cutest one.

3) You get a vacuum cleaner gun. Color me biased, its fun to use and I flipping loved Luigi's Mansion.

4) Upgrades feel meaningful. Early on, your pretty strapped for cash. Get some money? Neato, time to upgrade that pen with a Solar shield so the Phosphors don't disintigrate at daybreak (like vampires). Got some Phosphors? They can fly, ya'll need a higher wall. Got a solar shielded, giant walled corral? They are hungry, grow them some food. And so on. Money is not impossible to come by (far from it), and makes life a lot easier for you in noticable bounds with every penny you pour back into your farm. Higher walls offer more containment, fertile soil grows plants faster, silo upgrades give you more space. Also almost every upgrade has a asthetic associated with it. Thats quality right there.

5) Its a game that just wants to be a game. Honestly its a real problem nowadays with economic styled games - they force you to suffer until you can get better off. And I don't mind that, in fact I enjoy that in Rune Factory and Harvest Moon. Working to get your feet off the ground and be successful with less work isn't just fun, its actually basically the most human desire I can think of in gaming (besides sex). And this game is hard at the beginning to get off the ground. But getting off the ground is fun, and its not ever a grind to do it. Jetpack? Buy it in 1 day, easily. Ranch upgrades? Each one might be expensive, but the essentials are incredibly easy to get. The game lets you have fun with it, and it feels like a real game the entire time.


Easily a 7/10 right now, and personally thats likely to go up if they continue working on it at a good pace. A lighthearted gem of a farming sim. Not a ton of content, I'd probably benchmark it at about 5 hours of genuine game content (not counting getting the farm up to speed) as of right now.


EDIT (As of May 22, 2016):

Wanted to make a quick note about the development of the game for those who are interested. The development team for this game is (from what I've gathered) rather small, and as a result development is rather slow. That being said, its actually not so bad. The game gets regular updates (roughly every 3 to 5 weeks), and each update adds something concrete. Still a very happy recommendation of a very playable game."

Slime Rancher, the out of nowhere hit that took hearts by storm with its absolutely adorable slimes and gameplay. This game was the first project by its developer, Monomi Park (Only founded 4 years ago and looking promising already!) and continues to release FREE expansions whenever they can. (How f*cking rare is that sh*t?) But you really want answered is this: ""Is Slime Rancher worth my money?"" You bet your butt it is. Not only can you try the free demo (Which, like, NOBODY does anymore), but I am going to explain why this is worth your time.

Positives

The Most Stress-Free Game on the Planet
Everyone has their own problems, and mine is anger. I go absolutely apesh*t at the smallest of reasons (But I'm still sane enough to not hurl my controller around, I just get REALLY loud.). Slime Rancher is one of those games that not only doesn't get me mad, but also keeps me in a constant state of happiness. The environments and gameplay are so peaceful and satisfying that you can't help but smile at the antics of the slimes as they bounce around merrily. You will feel GOOD playing this game. It can take your mind off the stress of your job, school, whatever! It's just so relaxing to play.

There's Some Solid Gameplay Here
Its not just all looks. Slime Rancher has a hearty meal of gameplay ready to serve. You can go wander the untamed wilds of the Far, Far Range by exploring jungles, caverns, deserts, and ancient ruins. You'll find rare and exotic slimes to capture and bring back to your Ranch to take care of, by cultivating their favorite foods that you found while exploring. You can use that to make money, just to turn around and build some more gadgets to go exploring all over again! It's a truly enjoyable cycle that combines the graphics, atmosphere, and simple but rewarding gameplay to make you want to just keep playing for hours on end, and forget that paper you have due tomorrow morning.


Now this isn't everyone's cup of tea, but I'm a sucker for good achievements. I'm always annoyed by either really dirt easy achievements, way too many achievements in general (Looking at you, TF2, with your insane 400+ achievements), or either dead / WAY too elite achievements. Slime Rancher has none of these problems. There's a hearty, but not overwhelming amount of achievements that are amusing to get, or delightfully satisfying to obtain. None of it is ever too hard, but the hardest ones aren't too easy either. It's a great balance that I definitely enjoyed completing.


I'm not gonna spoil anything, but as you progress you read messages left by the previous owner of the Ranch, Hobson Twillgers, giving advice and telling about his own adventures on the Range. Eventually he starts telling his final story to you as you go deeper into the Far, Far Range, ending in a rather pleasant final message that gave me a little bittersweet smile. The same goes for Casey, a close friend left behind on Earth when the character, Beatrix, left for the Far, Far Range. They will send you emails periodically, revealing more about both themselves and Beatrix before ending in a final goodbye and an absolute beautiful credits song that got me to actually tear up a bit. It's no Deus Ex, but it is very good for not even being the main focus of the game.


This deserves a spot on the Positives. Slime Rancher is so adorable that I guarantee you will smile constantly at all the happy bouncing slimes. If you don't, you are lying and trying to act tough. Quit posing and embrace the adorableness.



I can not think of a single complaint with this game. Not even kidding. This thing could run on a calculator and still look decent. There are no true consequences for dying or screwing up, the slimes are adorable, and you get FREE content updates because Monomi Park is cool like that. As far as I am concerned, this is in the Top 25 for I love this game to death.

In the end, I believe 110% that Slime Rancher is worth your time and money. I have seen MASSIVELY worse games charge FAR MORE and give FAR LESS than this little bundle of joy. Give it a shot, and I guarantee you'll love it."

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
This game is like if anti-depressants and pure cocaine made sweet, sweet love. Slime rancher is adorable, addicting, and just loads of fun. The movement reminds me of an arena shooter. There's a sense of wonder when you explore and find areas you've never seen before, especially when you just jetpack over the walls that block unfinished areas. Even those in-development areas give you hope for what this game will become. I ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ love this game. Also going to point out that I am a 19 year-old male who is in the Army infantry. So yes, this game can be enjoyed by literally everyone."

Slime Rancher is a cute as heck game about building up your farm on a distant planet that is inhabited by slimes.

It offers everything a good farming game should have in my opinion.
Building, maintaining and upgrading your farm




There really is a lot you can do. Where you want to put your focus is your own choice though, the game doesn’t force you to do anything.

Want to create a paradise for slimes and let them roam freely in gardens?
Want to life out your capitalist side and enslave slimes in mass animal husbandry to maximize your profit?

You kinda see what I’m getting at here. The game can be played at your own pace and you can do whatever you feel like, there isn’t really any way to mess something up. The high degree of freedom that is given to the player and the constant feel of safety are probably what makes this game so relaxing.

I originally played the game when it first came to steam and picked it up again recently. The amount of content that got added over that time is impressive. There are so many things you can do and ways to play the game that it won’t get boring anytime soon. If you are only slightly interested in the genre or idea behind the game I absolutely recommend this one."

Slime Rancher is an amazing game, You have to explore and find keys to explore further, Find the rarest slimes and cross breed them, upgrade your ranch, and use technology to ranch even smarter.

There are many different kinds of slimes, They all have a favorite food, All Slimes poop out their own plort kind if you feed them and poop out 2 of those plorts if you feed them their favorite food. Plorts are worth money. The goal of the game is to farm these plorts and upgrade your farm and its technology.

You own a blow/suck gun that can hold slimes, plorts, fruits, etc, You can upgrade the capacity, but you can also upgrade your speed, your jetpack, even your ranch itself. Then there are end game technologies like teleporters, mining equipment to extract extra rare crafting materials. You can even craft decorations for your slimes, like googly eyes.

If you feed a type of plort to a different type of slime it will mix the 2 types of slimes into 1, But be carefull, If you mix a third it will turn into a Tarr, Which is a dark slime that turns all other slimes and eats ranchers. It is important to take on the Tarr as soon as possible before your whole ranch is gone.

In the Wild you also find Feral slimes, these can be of any type and will attack you, There are also Largos which are bigger slimes that can not be sucked up by your gun, you can transport them however, but only 1 at a time, And they are able to attack you if you carry them.

There are also Gordo slimes, These are the biggest slimes, They can not be moved, The goal is to feed them until they burst, They mostly drop a slime key, Which you can use to open up doors to new areas or shortcuts to certain areas. Some slimes are pretty tough to find, But getting all their favorite foods is even harder.

On your ranch you have little squares which you can use for several things, Like growing fruit, slime pens, storage lockers, etc. These squares are limited, so you have to think hard about what slimes to mix and what slimes to keep. You unlock more squares by unlocking more patches of land, There are even squares outside your ranch late endgame.

There are several special areas, where you have to hunt for a fruit or a specific slime, They mostly are collect as many as possible each round to unlock end game rewards. There are also missions at your ranch where people request certain items, They can be pretty easy sometimes so it is worth it to keep an eye out.

The game is mostly exploring, finding new areas, and bring exotic stuff back to your ranch to grow or breed it further. just pushing 300 slimes in a pen is also funny to do. It is a nice relaxing game with great level design and very charming graphics.

Plorts can be sold at the market, This will be your main income, The prices fluctuate heavy, So it might be worth storing some stuff if prices are really low, End game you can even create portable markets that you can place anywhere you like. There is a suprising amount of end game content in this game.

I do not think it is a great game for replayability, But getting 50 hours in the game should be pretty easy. There are other gamemodes, but the main game is where it shines, Taking your time, taking care of some slimes and go out when you feel like it. End game will feel a bit bland, Collecting hundreds of the same fruit kind in the same general area feels like a chore.

The game won't run if you have a controller connected and the per game setting is set to global settings or forced on. Set it to forced off at the per game input setting in the properties window and the game will run great with a controller.

Overall the game is great, there is not a real challenge, Even Rush mode is pretty easy once you got the hang of the game, But it is very relaxing, And extremely addictive, It has some great exploring and mixing slimes to see the result is just amazing. I have to give the game a solid 9.

Still waiting for new update
Why you should buy this:
Anybody can play this game.
Easy to learn.
Set your own difficulty by setting how many slimes you take care of.











Some new icons for the spaces, really cute design. Love the extra detail to the farm. The updated plort market screen is nice. The new music... Omg It's so beautiful. This update is so wonderful! Oh, the detail spreads out to the land too. (I'm writing more to the review as i play.)
Rapid fire was added, if you hold down the left mouse you will fire faster and faster. Now that's useful. :o
The gordos look fatter and cuter x3
The ground shines at night and omg it's so beautiful.
the water has a new slot, much more convient.
Rad slimes are really neat, the fact you get radiation around them is a cool feature.
water slimes just look like blobs with eyes now... i liked when they were actually slimes with the cute happy face.

When I saw it on the steam store I was like ""Hmm...""
After I got some money I thought about the game, I looked at Jacksepticeye's playthrough of it a bit, and it was awesome. I really liked the way it looked so I bought it.
First few minutes i was getting used to the controls, doing the tutorial. Seemed easy enough; Though the one thing is, is that having too many slimes in one carrol is hard to do/ hard to take care of them all at once.
Knowing this, I take care of as many slimes as I can handle. When I came across the cat slime, I was going so crazy over it; but then, it ate a pink slime's poop thingy [Plorts] (I can't believe I already forget it) and it turned into a big pink kitty! There was also these rocky spike slimes; they are adorable... but hurt you. ;u;
I took care of the kitty with my other slimes but kept it outside. Then... I discovered the tarr. A really messed up slime that you cannot absorb or keep; well because it's evil. I had to throw them into the sea so i could easily destroy them. Then i found out i could take water and shoot it at them till they died or put them into water. Where is when i found boom slimes. Well they explode; that's pretty much it, but they have a good worth of newbucks(?).
There are different slimes and they can all combine into a largo which is a big slime that is both of the slimes through eating the [plorts] poop stuff.

Graphics and music update!
The music transitions very nicely between areas keeping an alike theme, making it feel like you are actually going places. Alot of lighting difference with slimes and the ground. Water texture is a bit too blue but i get the point it's supposed to be fresh water. Geysers look fantastic, slime sea has seaweeds now and a bit of a tint change.
In all 0.25 is very beautiful.


Beautiful shaders, improved graphics of vegetables and fruits. Enhanced soundtrack.
Overall really great. The lucky slime is cute but disappears after a while. Sad i couldn't feed it when i found one. Slime locks are better looking,


New more cartoony style icons for the plots and upgrades.
all machine screens are more realistic.
achievements added. more detailed food textures, fruit tree looks more tree like now.
field of suction is more refined, not picks slimes up when you aren't aimed at them.
the new moss blanket is so pretty at night
i found the hunter slime and they are cute :3


YEAAAAHHHH SCIENCE!

Since this game is an early access there is alot more to come to this, so bear in mind i shall update this review over time.

Tl;dr
The game is wonderful, you should buy it because it's really fun."

Unabashedly cute, mechanically tight. This is pure distilled joy.

Gameplay loop is hypnotic (explore, cultivate, expand). Super Zen and a great way to unwind.

Smart design sensibilities (think PopCap), engaging gameplay systems, glorious & happy technicolor landscape.

One of the absolute best $20 values on Steam, atm.

Thumbs WAY up."

I've only been playing this game for about a day, and I've clocked in 11 hours.
It's so good.
I recommend for those with Depression.

Edit: Contrary to what is an unfortunately popular belief, Depression is not ""sadness"", it's a mood/ brain disorder. Google please, educate yourself."

i love forcing slimes into prisons for eternity, then forcing them to eat so i can steal their poop, then force feed their poop to other slimes to combine them, then force those combined slimes to eat sso i can steal their poop once again and sell it for a profit. Sometimes i even force the vegan slimes to eat a chicken or two.

Edit: Thanks for the awards <3"

Definitely a great game. This is great for my down time and I use my steam account for the entire household and allow younger kids to play it while I am babysitting, or I can just play it on the big TV screen and all the kids love it. They are so happy to learn each new slime or area. The bright colors to the strategy and monetary system helps the little ones learn. 10/10 would buy the game again."

Someone once wrote a very precise review of this game:


""This game does in 2 hours what 2 years of antidepressants would do.""

And they weren't Joking. SR even though made some *QUESTIONABLE- at best, choices.. *cough cough* epic. They're a very user friendly studio, and extremely good at what they're doing.

The game puts you in the place of a new slime rancher, Beatrix LeBeau (or something amongst those lines, i can never really remember. On her way to become the best rancher there is. She has bought a neat islnd on a planet called far, far range, where slimes are abundant and thriving. Your job? Enslave Capture aforementioned piles of gel, put them in a special corral and give them food to make Plorts. What are plorts?

The game is solely singleplayer, with a very small chance of multiplayer as the devs stated on the discussions and their forums. (I think they're actually tired of answering this question since launch.)

What makes the game so good is not only the whole idea of slimes being your very best friends instead of the very first XP farm in the game: The graphics and the soundtrack that creates such a cute-ish and relaxed atmosphere. There isn't also much violence in the game too! Making it perfect for smaller kids to play.

The game is contiuingly developped by Monomi, who are giving out free updates regurarly, With the last one being the SLIMEULATION update, every update they made so far added something major to the mechanics of the game, which makes the endgame and midgame very likable and very wide, you can race with slimes, look for prehistoric slimes, hunt down glitch slimes... multiple things!

The lore of the game, except you buying that far-far range of yours, really shows you some character, too. Even though every character looks very happy, and now they are... they also do have some backstories, and every one of them as cliche as it is unique in it's own way.

This game really helps you think and sort things out while playing, even though you are alone in the game, slimes and their smiles show you you ain't out there alone... I do actually reach out for this game today quite depressed and... it really makes me forget what has happened today.... Sorry for the emotional part lads but it struck me out of nowhere.

But sure as hell this game even though I felt like Shiitakkee mushrooms, it made me smile for a minute, forgetting what happened."

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
So, you might be thinking right now ""it's got positive reviews, but is this game for me?"" Well, I'll break it down into a few questions you should answer for yourself:

1. Do you like adorable and bubbly creatures, even when it comes to the baddies?

2. Do you like stylized and beautiful graphics and design?

3. Do you like farm and resource management games that are very simply yet still has plenty of things to do?

4. Do you enjoy upgrading your character and the world in order to explore and expand interesting places?

5. Do you want another reason to buy this game, even though the first 4 questions above have already convinced you?

If you answered ""yes"" to any of these questions, then definitely look into this game, even at $20, it's worth it. If you answered ""yes"" to of these questions, then I doubt you're reading this right now, as you're most likely already at the checkout screen for this game. If not... then stop reading this and buy this game!"

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Pros
-Simple and Fun
-Lots of places to explore
-Looks great even on low settings
-Can be run on bad computers
-Many things to keep you occupied for hours
-Game doesnt hold your hand through the game, it lets you discover things
on your own and it only gives you some information.


Cons
-I ran out of things to do after 6 hours (Yes I know its early access)
-Exploration follows a line, making it feel less open
-Huge walls block your vision and make the place feel closed off
-No multiplayer


Conclusion

Other than a few small things and lack of content, this game is extremely fun, and kept me playing for hours straight.
I definetly reccommend this game, assuming it won't be abandonded by devs in early access."

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Day 33 of gameplay and something unspeakable happens.
By this point I had mastered the game. Over 60,000$, fully upgraded everything. I could pump out 200+ plorts in a day no problem. The stock market had crashed with how much I sold and it had gotten to the point where I had three silos filled to the brim with plorts and I didn't have enough patience to sell them. Eventually churning out plorts gets boring. So I released most of my slimes, and now I keep four slimes in each cage, name them, keep them well fed with their favourite foods. I even feed the local slimes outside my home if I have time.

One day I was going about business when I saw a pink slime had wandered into my farm (I don't keep pink slimes, I find them annoying) Now, ten days prior I would have fired him straight into the sea to see the rest of his murdered family, but he was so bouncy and I was a somewhat of a Slime Activist now, so let him live.
Days past. Weeks. I get attached to the slime, naming him Wanderer. I feed him a balenced diet of chickens, fruits and veggies. I swear he loved me! Sometimes he jumped on my head and he would follow me around as I fed the other slimes.
Day 33 dawns like any other day. I get up and do my daily duties. Wanderer is hopping around and I throw some carrots at him for breakfast. I leave after my chores to get some fresh water for the puddle slimes and I come back with some pogo fruits for him. As I round the corner I see him hopping towards me. But, unbeknownst to him the Exchange machine was online and asking for pink slimes. I see his smiling face coming towards me, and I readied my gun to shoot the pogo fruit for him to catch when *poof* he's gone. Wanderer vanished. I look at the Exchange machine's screen and it says, ""1/12 Pink Slimes""
He had ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sacrificed himself to the Exchange machine in his doglike haste to greet me.
I was frozen in shock for a good three minutes before I quit the game. I haven't been on it since.
RIP Wanderer. Day 14?-33
I recommend this game if you're into getting your heart strings tugged. 11/10"

Slime Rancher came into my life right when I needed it most.
My mother died in May, 2021, and as this past May approached, I thought I was handling the impending one year anniversary of her death well, until suddenly my blood pressure was spiking so hard it was giving me literal chest pains, and causing my heart rate to soar.
Everything made me angry, kept me stressed out, and kept my BP dangerously high.
It turns out, that was a result of a combination of my anxiety, my grief over my mother, and the stress in my life that sometimes felt crushing...
Even my games caused my BP to spike, and that was making me more and more depressed.
And then Slime Rancher went on sale and my best friend bought it for me and told me to try it.
The soundtrack was relaxing, the graphics were soft and easy on the eyes, and best of all: There was nothing to trigger my anxiety and send my heart rate and blood pressure skyrocketing.
I could just play this and relax. It felt like a weight had been lifted from my neck and shoulders and I felt like I could breathe for the first time in a month.
I'm not saying this game saved my life, but I am saying that it -along with working with my therapist, and help from my nurse practitioner- helped me keep my stress levels low, my blood pressure from spiking, and my heart from feeling like it was about to explode...
If you need something fun, that will help you relax and forget the stressful world around you for a while, Slime Rancher is that game."

I actually got this for free on the Xbox One for my kids. It was one of the Games with Gold this month. After my son played for a bit, I took over for him. Then my other son wanted to play. I could see this was going to be a fight for the Xbox, so purchased one copy for my PC and another for the Steam Machine so we can all play at once.

It's addictive - and a bit mind numbing. You'll lose some hours, but it's got just enough strategy, crafting, exploration and market explotation to keep you occupied. I'm about 10 hours in right now after spending about 3 or 4 on the Xbox version. Of course the PC version is better - not nearly as laggy when the ranch gets busy. Getting the ranch up and making steady profit is the biggest hurdle - it takes a few hours to really get it up and running. After that, the exploration works on some level, mostly as a break from the huting and gathering required to get a steady income. There isn't anythign very dangerous in the world, most of the enemies you can easily disperse or avoid. I've heard most people finish this game at around 30 - 50 hours. That's about the right amount of game play I assume. It's has some very addicting elements - but it's not something that will have great replay value and definitely not something I would want to spend more than a few weekends playing.

I do recommend this game - it's great for kids, it has just enough allure for adults and like others have mentioned, a multiplayer (even 2 player split screen) would go a long way making this a great family game. The price is right for the amount of gameplay offered."

Slime Rancher
(Read on for the full review!)
======================================

TL;DR:
Are you four years old? Full grown adult? Old man? Doesn't matter, just buy this adorable, fun RPG by Monomi Park!

======================================

+ Lush, adorable pixels everywhere.
+ Simple, cute, not super repetitive.
+ You ranch the cutest things ever. Come on.
+ The plort exchange is a cool concept.
+ Upgrades galore! Addictive!
+ Transparent, nice, stick to roadmaps.

- Auto-feeders will release more food than necessary, gardens need constant mindfulness of harvests, plort collecters will fill up very fast with favorite foods. Slime science can alleviate much of this, but only so much.

Hello and welcome to this review of Slime Rancher, an adorable FPS RPG about corralling slimes and stealing their poop for sweet sweet profits! Let's get started.

So the meat of Slime Rancher is in its gameplay, where you explore, discover, and...ranch slimes. You can corral them, free-roam ranch them, or let them hang out in their preferred areas and clean up their droppings to your liking.

So first off, there are small slimes that are manageable and come in a simple variety, larger slimes that are a combination of more than one, and giant stationary slimes you have to feed to break apart and get rewards from. Apart from the giant slimes, Gordos, you get plorts from the small and large (Largo) slimes, which are their magical poops that feature a wide variety of uses in technology and are considered quite valuable. As a slime rancher, you collect slimes and feed them so you can collect their plorts.

There's a lot of exploration in Slime Rancher, with 4 huge areas and many sub-areas and passages between them. There's also a lot of content. While the game is simple to play and the goal is simple, there's all manner of upgrades to unlock from teleporters to health and jetpack efficiency increases. You can upgrade your corrals and farms and coops to make things run smoother, too.

Not everything has to be purchased though. Fruit and vegetables grow in the wild, and there's boxes with random goodies and treasure capsules waiting to be discovered, too!

I don't want to say too much, as this is a wonderful and magical feeling title and I'd hate to spoil that for anyone, but it's a great game that's fun even though a lot of the gameplay boils down to sucking things into your vac-pac or shooting them out. This is a case where even though what you're doing may be a boring action, the way you do it and the reasons for doing so make the game a real treat.

So the graphics. My god the graphics. This game is gorgeous, from its great execution of the realistic turned cartoony style to it's crisp design and great use of vibrant and varied color. The whole game is a visual treat full of varied VFX and unique areas with distinct identities. Oh, and did I mention everything everywhere is freaking adorable? Absolutely anyone can find something to enjoy here, gameplay and graphics-wise.

The audio in Slime Rancher is fantastic. Each area has its fair share of unique ambience, but since so much of the game involves the wildlife, each area gets its own sort of unique sound through the foreground noises it produces also. Most sounds are concise and satisfying, and have the feel of a happy birthday celebration. Streamers and confetti shooting off, joyous laughter, plants and wildlife being spit out of the ground with a fun popping sound, plorts clinking around, etc. The music is just as happy, and just as stellar. Maybe after 10 or 20 or 50 or 100 hours you'll get tired of it, depending on your tastes, but until then it's a blast.


So if you somehow didn't see this coming, I can safely recommend Slime Rancher at:

Full price.

Slime Rancher, a very laid back, casual game in which you are a farmer sent out to a distant world to collect and study these little blobs called ""Slimes"". These Slimes are distinct, different, and can be very challenging to herd. Feed a slime a plort of another slime and watch them combine, creating some very unique, and interesting combinations. This game has a sequel I haven't played yet but I loved this game and cannot wait to buy the next one in the series. It's worth every penny and everyone will agree."

Slime Rancher can be played in Adventure or Five Day Rush. The second choice is where you play for five days and get scored on how well you did. I advise people to start in the Adventure mode.

We have a device that lets us suck up objects, and to shoot them out. So we can go get wild slimes and bring them back to an enclosure. Then we collect food and feed them.

Slimes will drop plort. We collect it and then sell it. Then we can upgrade a variety of things on our farm. It is also important to farm the food for the slimes. I kept some wild food I found and built areas for them to grow on my farm. There are a variety of different kinds of slimes in Slime Rancher. Certain slimes can merge together to make new slimes. Some of these mixtures are beneficial and some are harmful.

Slimes can hurt the player as they are out there collecting resources. Be careful when you are first starting out. There are large world areas in Slime Rancher. Some of them are more dangerous than others. At first your vacuum gun can hold four things, and a certain limit on each of them. This means returning to your farm frequently early on in Slime Rancher."

I really like this game. There's no preassure to do anything or be anyone, you just sit back and relax. There's alot to like about this game so I'll try to give you pro's and con's.

The pro's:
This game is a great stress reliever, everything about this game just makes you go ""aww, that's cute,"" from the simplistic but effective art style to the sound design and music it is all very peaceful. However the world the Monomi Park have created is not only cute but well fleshed out with the Slimepedia giving insights into the world around you and almost everything has an entry in it: The slimes, the food, the biomes etc. The game is also frequently updated for free with large areas being added every few months. The mechanics such as slime science or even the ranching don't feel needed, you can just walk around the world.

Con's: I can only think of one thing that I disliked about this game and that's being finsihed with everything the game has to offer and needing to wait for the next big expansion. But this is a casual game so I don't really mind.

If you're looking for a fun and relaxing game that's just a good way to spend a lazy evening then get this game, you won't regret it."

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
This is a Review written for Version 0.2.4b, it may be updated at a later point, like the game itself.
Let's assume, since their second version numbers are the ""content"" updates, that the game is around 20% done so far.

I can say this after my first... roughly 4 hours:

Bright, Colourful, Cartoony and even in dark areas it's cheerful, rather than gloomy.
Hard to comment on it, since it's not for everyone. I personally like it, but that's just me,
in fact, it's what drew my attention to the game. It's very visually appealing to me.
Though, you'll have to see for yourself. If you like the way it looks in the screenshots,
it certainly won't disappoint you.

While the slimes' squeaks are rather adorable and the ""totally tense suspense music"" pops in each time danger is around,
it does get repetitive after a while of playing. It did not stick with me either, so either it's not too repetitive or not very memorable. This may just be the only actual criticism I have though and it might certainly change over time.
However: The sounds besides the background music are pretty clearly indicating when something is around. The Squishing of slime or ""Bawk bawk bawk""ing of chickens helps very much should you e.g. look for chickens in tall grass.

It's exactly what you think it is: You catch slime, feed them, they produce the goods you can sell, you do so and move on. Your Stats and Abilities can also be upgraded with said money, making the aforementioned process a bit easier.
Let me move the negative-ish things out of the way first:
If you wish to plant both fruits and veggies in your garden though, and your slimes only eat fruit, your veggies don't really go anywhere. I guess you can always take them with you and feed wild slimes, but I didn't see much point in that either, but since there is no way to sell them either, they just use up Silo space instead. Maybe I'll have slimes that like veggies at some point and then I'm happy I kept them, I don't know.
Another minor annoyance would be wild slimes getting in your way as you try to collect ... pretty much anything. Especially the big slimes will get in your way. A lot. Though.. that's really as far as it goes.
Respawn rates might also be a little bit.. unbalanced currently, seeing that I got about 50 Chickens within 3 minutes taking a tour through the Garden part of the Ranch after buying it. That's not really a complaint because it's very helpful if you need meat, but it might just make everything a little bit too easy.
Now the good things:
Besides my minor complaints here and there I had a looooot of fun. It's relaxing and the whole exploration aspect makes finding something new, something interesting much more rewarding, even more so when a pop up informs you what you even got/did just now, yes, there are ingame Achievements.
For the sake of not spoiling anything (since you don't really read reviews after getting and playing the game, now do you?) I can't really say what I enjoyed the most, but it was great. Really great.

And for an Early Access title? This is how it should be. It's playable, I didn't encounter any bugs and it's a lot of fun.

I'm pretty sure it's not a game that'll die either, this will be finished over time and it will only get better,
and knowing that, I can wholeheartedly recommend it, if anything you've already seen on the store page appeals to you."

I'm LONG overdue for writing a review for this game. Normally I'd write a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ review, but I can't for a game like this. This game is so colorful, vibrant, and just a genuine joy to play. It's almost impossible to be sad while playing, although the Star-mail and Hobson letters will absolutely tear your heart out if you're not prepared. The first time a Tabby Slime jumps at you your heart will melt. There's an incredible amount of love and passion poured into this game, and it's absolutely a title everyone should experience. I give this game a glowing recommendation, and I can't wait until Slime Rancher 2."

This game saved my life.

I am 42.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 :hearts::hearts::hearts::hearts::hearts::hearts::hearts: minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.
After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you"

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Slimer Rancher is a interesting game where you find and capture creatures called slimes to crossbreed them with other slimes to eventually harvest resources called Plorts. These plorts can be sold for money which can then be used to upgrade and therefore improve the way you capture and house these creatures to better harvest them for their plorts.

I spend hours going from a single and very basic corral for my slimes to multiple different high level corrals to house my ever growing collection of different slimes. The mechanic where you breed different slimes to combine traits of either slime is a very nice mechanic and allows players to strategize a little. For instance, I decided to only breed my slimes with a certain slime called a Rock Slime. The nice trait that rock slimes have to offer is their diet. They eat vegetables and therefore when bred with other slimes, their diet will also be veggies. Breeding all my various types of slimes with rock slimes allowed me to only grow veggies rather than a mixture of different things.

The game itself felt responsive and actually well polished. Never lagged or stuttered a bit. Never encountered a single issue or bug in the 14 hours I had played. Feels like a AAA title. The art style is great as well. Everything fits together perfectly and the design of the textures and models are top notch.

As for the breeding, the game allows you to only breed two base slimes together to create a final ""Largo"" slime which cannot be breed any longer. There might be a dozen or so different types of slimes, so for their to only be a single breeding per slime was unfortunate. It would be nice to see a in dept breeding tree of some sort. Breeding 3 or 4 different slimes together to finally reach a desired slime. A old mobile app called Dragon Story did it pretty well. You were given different base dragons and were given the option to breed them together. Each pair of dragons you bred together had a list of possible offspring it could create ranging in rarity, the more rare dragons having a lower percentage of actually getting. Those dragons could then be bred again with other dragons to further continue down the ""ladder"" to get more rare dragons.

I love the upgrade aspect to the different equipment you can purchase. Upgrading your corral to have, for example, an auto-feeder or auto-collector was a nice feature to have in a game like this. Almost every type equipment, whether it be a chicken coop, garden, or silo, each gave me options to upgrade and improve to make my life easier.

However, this game does seem to get quite repetitive after you've captured and breed most of the slimes and upgraded the different buildings. It went from adventuring to find more and cooler slimes to babysitting my slimes at my ranch. It got to the point, every quickly I may add, where I had pretty much every base type of slime in my ranch. At that point all you can do is continue to feed them and harvest the plorts for money, but already had purchased everything I could buy to improve my farm. I had 4 corrals, all upgraded to the max, 5 gardens growing veggies, a pond, and a silo. Now those aren't the only things you can buy but that is all I needed to keep my farm self sufficient.














Overall it is a good game. I would recommend this game to a friend.


As for things I would like to see added to the game, my biggest suggestion would be to allow players to almost nearly automise their ranch. It would be nice to see a game mechanic that allowed players to automatically transport finished crops into a silo via transport tubes or something and then distributed via different tubes to nearby corrals. Possibly having plorts be extracted for corrals and sent to silos via transport tubes as well. I love the upgrade mechanic but I wish I could see it be more used and more in depth than its current state."

Slime Rancher is a literal antidepressant; the art style is gorgeous, and the developers are constantly adding more content. I cannot fault it - which is even more impressive when you consider that it's an early access title.

slime+rancher,Recommended,25.6,"Posted: January 19, 2021
I love this game but I have a few issues with it,
1. There NEEDS to be more automation in this game, it sucks when your out exploring and you come back to your farm with all of your slimes running rampant because the stack of 40 food you left wasn't enough to support them for 30 min.

2. the bees are ok, they really lack when it comes to automation since they only perform a single task plus there is a limit to how many you can have operating at once and they are way too expensive to make.

3. The lack of console commands in the base game is a little disappointing when you just want to make something but you don't want to spend 10 min waiting next to a machine which may or may not give you what you need.

4.I understand that an aspect to the game is the limited inventory but in the late game those 4 slots become really annoying I wish there was an upgrade for more since the constant back and forth in the base gets tiresome.

5. If the game offered an explanation as to what affects the plort market prices that would be good because it's a little annoying when the price of a plort drops from 150 to 50 in a SINGLE DAY.

6. with the way the game is now, 1 chicken coop can barely support a carnivor slime habitat (10 slimes) and for the fruits and veggies you almost need 1 field plot for each slime habitat. If there were more space available on the ranch or if the crops yielded more it would be a welcome improvement.

That being said I do love the game an I hope it just keeps getting better

This is a fantastic game. I highly recommend it for achievement hunters looking for another game to 100% as well as the casual players looking for a chill game to play on their downtime. The visuals are cartoonish, yet elegant and high in detail, so it's almost always very pleasing to just stare at for hours. It honestly just hits so many marks for what makes a game enjoyable.

What To Expect
I won't delve too far into the details since exploring and finding out for yourself is all part of the fun, but you play as a woman, named Beatrix, who has just bought the Far, Far Range from someone, a set of ranches on a planet thousands of light years away from Earth. You're now taking in the sights, experimenting with farming, feeding, and caring for various slimes, selling their poo- I mean plorts, as well as completing rancher quests, all in an attempt amass a fortune. With the currency gained from selling slime shi- plorts, you can manage your farm, unlock new areas of the Far, Far Range, upgrade your equipment, and partake in an optional rewards program (although it's basically necessary).


This game engulfed me for quite some time, but here's 3 aspects of the game I didn't exactly enjoy or would've liked to see improved. Do let this deter you from playing the game and forming your own opinion.


With some of these, I'm not entirely sure what could've been changed to make them more enjoyable, but that's that!


The majority of the game has achievements associated with it that are very easy to understand, so you shouldn't need any help, but the rush mode achievements seemed daunting to me at first. If you feel the same way, I'd suggest checking out Epokk's YouTube video, linked below..."

A rollercoaster ride of colour and cuteness.

It looks simple enough, and I thought it would keep me entertained for a couple of hours. Boy, was I in for a shock. Every time I thought I'd reached the limits of the map, there was another slime door to open. The world expanded and expanded like a Slime Gordo being fed its favourite food. The slimes are cute and friendly (mostly) and you'll find at the beginning that you horde pink slimes and dote on them and talk to them and feel like the richest rancher alive every time one poops out a little pink plort. I remember those days, of feeling horrified if you saw a slime fall into the water and die, and of apologising if you had to let some go free from your ranch.

But oh, how things change. When the newbucks greed sets in, and you start breeding plorts like mad by keeping insane amounts of slimes in slave-like conditions. You're keeping hen-hens and roostros just to breed them furiously like the pimp you are. You're mercilessly throwing slimes into the water when they're no longer useful, even throwing them in the incinerator without batting an eye. No slime is safe or has a permanent place on your ranch. You'll give any slime the boot the moment a more profitable one comes along. And the slimes themselves aren't good enough for you anymore - oh, no they're not - you insist on turning them into largos for DOUBLE PLORT OUTPUT. This game will make you a monster.

I've caught a hunter gordo and looked him dead in the eyes. I've created a money-making farm of mosaic-saber slimes living on silver parsnips to making over 20k a day. I've played catch with a briar hen chick... and saved it just before it drowned in the slime sea. I've brought life to the Glass Desert then stripped it dry again like the power-hungry god I've become. I've drilled to the core of the earth and fallen asleep to the gentle whirr of plort collectors. I've mastered the technology of the phase slimes and created teleporters to save me walking two feet round the corner. And when a pink slime ate a plort that I wanted before I could suck in into my vac gun, I watched with malicious glee as a tarr slime came up and devoured that thief. I could have helped, but chose not to. That pink slime won't steal from me again.

From caves to the highest peaks, I've seen and done it all. And now, it's up to you. Two doors lie in front of you, reader. Beyond the first lies the future where you don't buy this game. You'll never get a 7Zee Club Member Reward. You'll never feel the thrill of having 400 gold plorts filling up your silo. You'll never wrestle with a crystal-boom largo, or feed cuberries to cute little honey slimes. You'll never stay up at night wondering if a rad slime is more rad than you. After all, he can do that cool 'glowy' thing.

Behind the second door is the path of buying this game. You'll earn the title of Slime Rancher and consider putting it on your resume. You'll sigh at the tranquility of puddle slimes, and realise they can teach you so much about how to coast through life. And some day, maybe, just maybe, you'll get to hold a gilded ginger in your hands.

I know which door I chose. And take it from an experienced slime rancher like me - if you have any sense in the world, you'll follow me through that second door.

Two doors, reader.

I'll meet you in Ogden's Retreat."

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
SO MUCH FUN! I originally bought this thinking it was going to just be novelty fun for like an hour or so, but it's actually super awesome! On top of the adorable graphics, it's just a fun game to play. The controls and character movement is great, it's really easy and fun to move around the world. It's also pretty interesting to learn how the different slimes interact with each other and what they need.

I also really appreciate that your energy & health regenerate so quickly. It makes the game a lot more fun to adventure in rather than just trying to survive all the time. I really love the letters you get, the way that slimes get you money, the way that farming and upgrades work, I just love this game.

Totally recommend it for people who want to relax with a cute and fun ranching simulator. The challenge is there, but it's not forced on you and you can go at whatever pace you like. I haven't even unlocked any other parts of the map but I'm really excited to. Even just the starting zone is great."

Edit: The new update fixed any of my ""complaints."" I would 100% recommend this game.

I like it a lot, but I wish they had a way to buy a helper. I want to have other people help out with my slimes/farms. I want to focus more on exploring. However, I do not like leaving my slimes. I want someone to help gather food, and to help feed my slimes while I am gone on an adventure. It is hard to sit back and enjoy the scenery of this amazing world while I know that I could be at home feeding my slimes, and gathering my gardens. I know about the auto feed system, but to have an AI helper could really help me relax, and enjoy the amazing wonders of exploring this world. Maybe the devs could also add in a tent or somewthing, so that I can sleep while I am out. This could make the game more about exploring in the late game when you need a small break from your many slimes."

A game where you ranch... slimes? Ok. I admit I was quite skeptical at first. It seemed like a gimmick, no more than a parody game. Somehow the reception it got was unusually good though and that got me curious. At least curious enough to give it a shot. And here we are. Time to examine if curiosity killed the cat. Again.

Slime rancher puts you in the shoes of a girl called Beatrix. She finds herself in a distant planet inhabited by all kinds of living blobs of goo, called slimes. Those slimes, when fed produce valuable items called plorts that can be used to craft all manner of things and have some value on the market. Beatrix, touched by the frontier spirit of entrepreneurship decides that a ranch on this remote planet would make perfect business sense. Next step, corral some of those slimes, farm their favourite foods for them and sell their plorts. Profit. To be fair, there is a rudimentary backstory that extends a bit further than that. Beatrix does follow the hints left behind by the previous owner of the ranch, Hobson, while exploring the landscape. The intent is I guess to flesh out the world some more. But I wouldn't say it makes much of an impact. Or any.

In the beginning, the game plays more like a foraging game than a ranching game. Beatrix is focused primarily on exploration and too poor to build proper facilities on the ranch. A few basic slimes is the most that can be afforded and frequent forays for food will need to be made to keep them complacent. The game's greatest flaw rears its ugly head here for the first time. It's repetitive. The player has to constantly go back and forth between the same few areas as they gather resources. The steep limit on how much Beatrix can carry doesn't help. Thankfully though, things do get better. A lot better. Once a few good patches of farmland and some decent pens for the slimes can be constructed, for a while it becomes a lot easier to enjoy the game. This middle-part of the game, is easily its strongest.

By this point Beatrix will have captured a few good slimes, merged them into large hybrids that produce more plorts and have a fairly steady income. This in turn can be used to start expanding the ranch and buy improvements, including more carrying capacity and greater running ability. Indeed, there is a lot of things to unlock and much to explore. But the aforementioned flaw has not been remedied, merely staved off. As the areas to explore grow more distant and require more walking to reach, worse still, as the ranch itself becomes bigger and bigger, it rears its ugly head again. This time with a vengeance. The later game is plagued by an endless array of repetitive tasks. When the in-game day is not long enough to properly manage your ranch, it's clear something is wrong. Granted, in the very late game there are some minor automation options, but by then, does it matter?

Gameplay considerations aside, it is the presentation that is the highlight of the game. Indeed, much attention is given to the cuteness, memetic factor of the slimes. And they are ridiculously cute, saccharine even. It's no accident there is not one, not two but three cat based slimes. If it's not clear why, the first time one sees a tabby slime it becomes obvious. Their sound effects complement the design well and further enhance their effectiveness. The graphics in general are stylized, vibrant and beautiful. It makes the land that much more fun to explore. Rounding this experience is the music, which deserves some special praise. Many times I would find myself just stopping my exploration to listen to a tune. My favourite is the tune that plays in the ancient ruins. It was atmospheric and mysterious, very fitting to the area I was exploring.

Overall, do I recommend it? It's a tough one. The game has great presentation and it is effective in luring you in with its sugary theme. All pleasant and bubbly. But the gameplay is erratic. It packs a problematic beginning, a satisfying middle and a disappointing finale, all in one. Nevertheless, I can't bring myself to not recommend this game. Instead, I'll say give it a shot, but be aware of the kind of game you are getting into. If micromanagement and repetition is not your cup of tea you may want to look elsewhere."

Best Multiplayer game in years. When 4 people get together and cook as a team, nothing feels more rewarding beating your own high score as a group and not failing any orders in that round. It's main campaign is co-op based, with you and up to 3 more players prepping ingredients, cutting, cooking, stewing, serving, and washing dishes. THe levels can be plain, with interesting bottlenecks in the kitchen design, to surreal and bizarre, like hanuted houses that siwtch the stations around, or cooking and serving between 2 moving trucks on a highway.
Steam Link integration is superb, allowing for some of the best Couch co-op I've played in years. The rules and controls are extremely easy, but incredibly difficult to master as a cohesive team, but very fun and rewarding as a group experience. No wars would exist, racism would end, injustice stamped out, if everyone in the world played Overcooked.
A must have game."

Wildly fun mayhem, reminiscent of playing Mario kart as a teen.

Why can't there be more couch co-ops of this quality?
.
The only con: The 'star ratings' seemed pretty imbalanced, some levels we would get 3 out of 3 stars on the first go, others we had a ball trying the same level for hours just trying to get to 3. It's a shame we didn't have a reason to try to get that level of perfection out of all of the levels.

We played mostly as 2 player but we did try 4 player once, it was much easier to achieve a perfect 3 start result.

This game is without a doubt great for (local) multiplayer, but not great for single player.

Even though I bought it for online multiplayer (which it doesn't have, but that's my bad), and I had to try it out on my own, I can tell from what little I played that this is a great game with great design overall. Playing single player is certainly possible, but it's clearly not designed for it.

I was planning on refunding it but I figure the devs could use the money to work on online multiplayer, which it sorely needs. So there.

Still giving a positive recommendation for people who can play local co-op."

Just spent the weekend on the couch with my wife, eyes glued to the screen as we tried over and over again to triple star every level in the game (Plus the two expansions). After 19 hours, dry eyes and dehydration we accomplished our goal with our marriage intact. (And maybe our communication skills strengthened!). This game is fun af. No regrets.

The Good:
- Fantastic couch co-op
- Easy to pick up, hard to master
- Fun music
-Great (although endlessly frustrating, but that's part of the fun!) level design
- Runs well
- Challenging without feeling impossible
- Good variety of worlds and dishes and mechanics

The ok:
- You will miss click and place items incorrectly very often (Dropping food in the garbage by accident is the worst).
- Some glitches will be discovered, like items rolling off of tables and dishes on the sink being unreachable
- No online co-op
- Season expansion pack has too much festive soup and not enough other dishes
- You might go to bed angry at your spouse, you will yell at each other, you will swear a lot of swears

My wife has played this damn thing to three stars on every damn level including the expansions, including solo and co-op. She occasionally stomps my little ass in versus. And even though I've been totally dominated I have to say this game is tight. It's one of those things that just . . . all the pieces work together and go together perfectly. I just want Overcooked 2, and I hope they don't change a damn thing. It's one of the better video games I ever played really.

To the people giving it thumbs down for not being great single player - well, it's not supposed to be that. But like I say, my wife plays it single player and can beat the whole damn game like that. Which is insane and unnatural, but it can be done.

IF they could do a generally lag-free online co-op or multi, then that would be a good thing.

But seriously - this game is everything it set out to be - couch co-op - and it's a masterpiece of that. The damn graphics are impeccable, too. Simple, yes, but impeccable."

I love Overcooked - it's one of the best couch co-op games I've played! I've showed it to many people, and I can say that even people that have never touched a controller in their life can learn it quickly, thanks to a well designed tutorial, and have fun.

Overview
The controls are simple, move around, interact, and pick things up. However it is the teamwork and streamlining of tasks that is the best part of this game. Every level has a different kitchen layout, and you'll get a queue of tasks (food orders). For example, say you'll be making burgers this time, which requires: picking up ingredients, chopping vegetables and meat, cooking the patties, assembling complete burgers, and dish washing. The grill could be on one side of the level, with the cutting board and ingredients on another. You'll have to plan with your teammates who will take which task, and what method to transport the raw and cooked ingredients, in order to not take too long and piss off the customers!

I beat the entire campaign + all DLC with one other friend, while I've played most levels a 2nd time with 2~4 people. The levels are pretty well balanced for different group numbers, with a small portion of levels that seem to be more balanced towards 4 or 2 people, usually due to size. For example there was a huge map that would have worked better for 4 people due to its sheer size, whereas some small kitchens get cramped with more than 2 people. This is only an issue if you want to get 3 stars on everything - I've found all maps are beatable with any group, allowing for level progression.

""Hey! Grab the soup, grab the soup, it's going to burn!!""
""Crap, just one sec - oh no the counter is moving, I can't get over there!!""

""We have no plates!!""
""Oh shoot I'm doing it NOW!"" (Countdown timer almost at 0, run over the length of the level and grab the soup, rush to the delivery...)
""YESS!!!""

I heartily recommend this game for the strategy and cooperation involved, as well as good times with friends!

I have an Xbox wireless dongle for PC, 4 wireless Xbox controllers, and have Overcooked on my laptop and desktop. When I'm at friends' places, I bring the laptop and hook it up to their TV. When I'm at home I just use my desktop or laptop in the living room. This is truly a portable game if you have the wireless dongle and controllers - everything fits into an average school backpack."

Great game. My 8 year old son wont stop pestering me to play. I am reluctant because I have things to do but once you pick that controller up you can't put it down. ""Only 20 points off getting the 3 stars. Let's do it again"" and again and again and then the wife comes in from work. ""why is the kitchen a tip? Could you not have put the bins out? Why are you both in your underpants and vests""? and then the son starts ""dad im starving. I havent ate all day"" I reply ""me neither. We havent moved off this chair all day"" That is overcooked guys.

Best co-op game I have played. A real emphasis on teamwork.

Only negative I would say about the game is that some of the levels are crazy difficult to get 3 stars on. To the point of actually not possible. We are onto level 5-2 now. Probably near completion but not sure we will be able to complete it as you need a certain amount of stars to progress to the next level and some we simply can't do.

Other than the campaign there is also a versus mode. This is very enjoyable too. You go head to head. 2 chefs each to control by switching them with LB. You compete against eachother to see who can get the most points (orders completed) Some real tension and excitement with this game mode as well.

I think if they added multiplayer instead of local then this game be a 10/10. Since they havent done this I give it a 9.5/10."

My girlfriend never understood why I played video games so much until I got her to play this game with me.

As you can tell from the trailer, Overcooked is chaotically fun. I have only played Overcooked with 1-2 players, so I cannot say much about the 3-4 players mode. Though I would imagine that the kitchen becomes even more chaotic, and thus, less manageable with more players.

Positive:
- Overcooked is a party game that anyone can pick up on the go. The controls are straight forward and the gameplay is quite intuitive.
- I like that you can play on both keyboard and controller at the same time. Or two people can share one controller/keyboard. The developers really thought about making this game more accessible to more simultaneous players.
- I really enjoyed the different levels and the different gimmicks in each one. You’re expected to have a different game plan for each kitchen and to improvise as things start to go wrong. Overcooked is challenging but not to the point of frustration.
- I found the game to be quite forgiving. When food is about to burn, you are given a warning way in advance (I think around 4 seconds?) so you have plenty of time to react. Food doesn’t spoil, even if you cook it way in advance. You can throw ingredients and plates on the floor and nothing will happen. This game is chaotic enough, so I appreciate that the developers did not overcomplicate the cooking part.

- Only local co-op. I find it such a shame when co-op centric games do not include online multiplayer.
- For some reason the chopping takes roughly twice as long if you’re playing alone.
-This game works on a star system. You can gain up to three stars depending on your performance on a level. I found it somewhat annoying that later levels require you to have a certain amount of stars before you can play them. However, at the same time I can understand the reasoning behind this. Levels get progressively harder (kitchen layout, gimmicks, recipes) so you are expected to reach a certain mastery level before you can progress.
- I only disliked one level. In this level you are stuck on a platform floating on top of lava and the stoves are on mini platforms rotating around your platform. Creatively designed, but not very fun to play.
- This is a small detail but all the players connected can control the bus (you drive around in a bus to select a level). This leads to some chaotic driving that can either be hilarious or frustrating. I hope the people you are playing with aren’t trolls.

It is clear that Overcooked was designed to be a co-op experience. I would not recommend buying this game if you plan on playing it alone. The levels are chaotic and coordinating with your fellow players is harder than it looks. Having said that, be prepared to have fun while making mistakes."

This is one of the first games I ever played with my girlfriend. She wasn't really big on games, and thought it was a waste of my time and money. I had a tough time converting her, but I have to say this game helped me more than I ever thought possible.

My girlfriend is currently in culinary school, and has a passion for cooking. I thought ""hey! this is cool!"" and imagined the likes of ""Cooking Mama"", and ""Cook Serve Delicious"", and ""Diner Dash"". This game blows all previously mentioned games out of the water, plus every other cooking game out there I am sure of it! It's challenging, and it's hard, but it's a perfect level of difficulty for both veterans and newcomers to gaming. The level design makes the game difficulty harder in perfectly calculated increments. The next level is always harder, but the previous level trained you for it.

Great game. Best played with friends/family.

90/100

Ideal game for a Cozy Couch Co-op fanatics.
I use keyboard btw, and overcooked is a keyboard Split-Screen friendly Game.

To start playing with a friend, one of you must own the game. The one who owns the game must send invite to his/her friend under remote-play function in steam then set your split-screen settings.

For Keyboard Split-Screen Settings:
Go to game Options > Controller Split Settings > Choose the 3rd one which shows a keyboard divided in to 2 (First player using the left control keys - WASD; while the other one using the right control keys - arrow keys)

This is actually a teamwork game but sometimes I'm quite confuse as to whoever is the real enemy here - is it time? or my buddy?

Recenetly visited relatives and was looking for local multiplayer games to play with them. I have a preference for co-op instead of competitive but it's not easy to find local co-op games for PC. Had heard good things about Overcooked so downloaded and was glad I did.

I played with younger family members who are 5, 13 and 16 and they all enjoyed it. It was a challenge to involve the 5 year old properly but she felt included and had fun :) We started by her operating the buttons and me moving the character and then later used split control pads to let her try doing both.

Def recommend for playing with friends or family."

Not many games can make teamwork as fun as Overcooked does it, but then again it is only made to be played with a few friends/family members, not alone. The game is unforgiving if you try to solo the levels, and even with a single extra partner you could only get half way through at most. Definitely give this game a go, if you can get 2-3 friends or family to play alongside (couch co-op only!) which truly makes it one of more fun cooperative experiences i've had in gaming.

FYI: It is possible to play with a single friend over Nvidia Game Share, when adding ' -window-mode exclusive' to game paramaters.

PS: Developer should make this playable with online friends as well. I imagine many and myself would want to share these fun moments with their gaming buddies and even gift the game for that purpose."

My girlfriend and I have been trying to play more chill, relaxing co-op games together. We're not having much success though, because instead we finished Overcooked. If you love your friends or family members a little bit too much, then do I have a game for you.

Overcooked seems simple. You cook and clean, and there are only three buttons. Sure, sometimes your kitchen is rent in twain by an earthquake, or maybe you're cooking on the back of three trucks cruising 120km/h down the highway. But even then it's still shocking how quickly your teamwork and craftsmanship unravels when you and your partner devolve into rabid Gordon Ramseys screaming for the other to chop up some more GDMFBS ONIONS!

Part of this is because Overcooked is very sneaky. The game dumps an unreasonable amount of work on you that you can't possibly finish. But it also sets a fairly low bar for success; many times a level would end with mushrooms on the floor, half the kitchen on fire and six half finished dishes, and the game still slapped three stars on the end screen. It creates an emotional roller coaster where you feel like an idiot sandwich right up until Overcooked pulls back the curtains and calls you amazing.

So as high stress as Overcooked can be, it's very emotionally satisfying to clear a level, especially when your first instinct on seeing each level is to quit the game while mumbling ""absolutely not"" over and over. It also, despite what some may claim, is doable with only two people—two patient, understanding, communicative people. I haven't tried it, but I feel like four would almost make things a touch too... reasonable.

If anyone has any recommendations for relaxing co-op games I'm all ears, because modern co-op tends to skew towards stressful, sweaty, angry co-op. But as far as modern, stressful, sweaty, angry co-op goes, Overcooked is among the best. Just take frequent breaks and also compliment each other excessively."

Overall


Pros:
- Simple and solid mechanics;
- Great Visuals;
- A extremely good co-op game.

-  Not the best single-player.

- Regular




When people are looking for cooperative games, they should soon have Overcooked on the main page. Overcooked is simply a fantastic game, where you make a team with 4 friends and you have to cook the various challenges that come your way, but it is not fantastic for that, but for its simple mechanics and its fun, which opens up doors for players of all ages.

Your character does everything automatically, you simply have to click on a button to start working on that particular thing, such as slicing onions, but at a certain level you will have so much to do that you will surely leave things in half.

At the beginning the game starts extremely simple, but its level of difficulty increases on a gigantic scale with the passage of time, starting to have less time to prepare your dishes and starting to have real challenges, like cooking in the middle of an earthquake or in a moving car...

The single-player Overcooked isn't that fun. The Player is controlling two cooks at the same time, exchanging between them and doing the tasks. But it seems that the magic of fun disappears, it is as if it was better to be desesperate because it started a fire in the kitchen with friends.

Visually Overcooked is just beautiful, I find the characters in the game extremely funny and the maps themselves are extremely well designed and created. With details like light and shadows in perfect positions, it gives another look to the game.

In short, Overcooked and a magnificent game that in my eyes the only real problem is the single-player that takes away the fun of the game.

Seems like a fun game, but can't recommend it unless the developers add key control remapping instead of being stuck with the default button layouts that may not suit everyone.
Being able to remap keys is a basic feature of every properly made PC game. Just really sloppy not adding proper PC options to the game.

If however you don't care about control remapping and you find it on offer or in a bundle and have at least one friend to play with its worth a try."

This is an amazing, adorable, fantastically cute and addictive game... for couch co-op. Online multiplayer is non-existent and single player requires you to control two chefs at once. No adding NPCs to help you, no allowing you to dial down (or up) the difficulty at will, and you can only progress by getting certain numbers of stars per level--your only options are to get lucky with simple orders or grind until you're blue in the face, otherwise you're stuck.

Thumbs up if you have another friend with a controller/keyboard! But thumbs down for advertising a single-player experience and not putting any further thought into it."

When cooking goes bad

Cute and fun but slightly stressful. You will like this game if you don't mind being in a rush with time limitations. Teamwork is strongly encouraged because it's the only way to make all the orders in a timely manner. Also some of the challenges comes from navigating the level hazards like pits and using cooking tools like treadmills.

Impatience, raising your voice, laughing, sighing, crying, speaking over each other, forgetting, brain freeze, complaining about team members and more.

, it can be chaotic at times and mistakes will happen with more players. Still, It's a good way to judge your relationship if it survives this party game.

Have you ever played Monopoly and felt buyer's remorse? Perhaps you bought the browns and nobody landed on them, or you built a hotel on Mayfair only to go bankrupt the next turn. Monopoly Plus takes that feeling to a whole new level - reality. For the low, low price of £12.49 and a few hours of your time, you too can experience the strong urge to gouge your brain out with a blunt pencil.

This feeling is nothing against the concept - it is Monopoly and it is good fun with friends. But on a technical level, it was either developed by a tortured developer, a developer who hates development or a developer imprisoned in the depths of hell. Or a Ubisoft employee, which fulfills the preceding criteria.

So let's walk through an average game. You launch the game and select what language you want. You will become very accustomed to doing this, because you will have to do it every single time you open the game. I get that this was probably for accessibility, but just put it in the settings. Please. I have not become fluent in another language in less than a day.

Next, you maybe want to join your friend's game. There are no dedicated servers and since it is on uPlay you cannot join through Steam, meaning you have to add people and invite them on uPlay. But once you start a lobby, you have five minutes to get everyone in before the game starts. I don't know who thought this was a good idea and I likewise do not know if it can be disabled, but this is another UI sin that needs exorcised.

Now that you are in the game, you can begin playing. After you plug in your controller, that is - you can play without it, but the keyboard controls are just terrible and should be burned. Eventually, you'll just switch to keyboard anyway when your controller keels over and stops responding. This has always happened in every game I have been in - perhaps it is because I am using a PS3 controller, which then means that 'Full Controller Support' is misleading at best, a lie at worst.

So anyway, once you get your friends together you can have jolly good fun until the game dies. Yes, I ♥♥♥♥ you not - at some arbitrary stage, for some arbitrary and non-discernable reason, the game will decide to just keel over and kick you from the game. It won't crash, it will just return you to the main menu. And because that is not sadistic enough for UbiShite, you then cannot rejoin the game even if everyone else is still present. But hey, at least you got a shiny uShite badge that certifies you knocked over a piece on the board.

So no, I wouldn't recommend buying this. I wouldn't recommend buying it on sale. I wouldn't even recommend accepting a gift of this game or straight up pirating it. For a little less, you could play Monopoly via Tabletop Simulator. Until UbiShite patches this (which they won't as it doesn't make money), avoid it like the plague."

DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. I purchased this game with myself and 2 others for the purpose of playing together online. That's $45 to play monopoly with 3 people online. But this game has that function right? Great!!

It is literally impossible to finish a game, without it crashing. There is NO possible way. The game crashes when someone has to mortgage properties to stay in the game. WHICH ALSO MEANS you have to play a 1.5 hour or longer game to get to that point where it crashes. So the game crashes and I google search port forwarding you need to do to get the game to work. I helped all of us (3 computers) forward the required ports... and guess what SAME EXACT ISSUE. So I request a refund for all of us and we all get instantly denied because we played more than 2 hours... It would have been very hard to know the game was broken before 2 hours because the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game only breaks towards the end of the match... Awesome!!! This game is absolute trash. Complete waste. It's a shame because if the online worked I might give it a 3 out of 5.. But no, In this case, this is the worst game purchase I have ever made.

Do yourself a favor and download the iOS or android version of the game for $4 each if you want to play online. Because this piece of ♥♥♥♥ game has had this issue for almost 5 years. I've seen youtube videos describing the SAME issues and NO SOLUTION anywhere. I opened a tech support ticket with Ubisoft because steam wont refund me after continuing to sell a product which is falsely advertised as (ONLINE PLAY). Ubisoft wants some error report from my computer.. but the issue is with their game not my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ PC. Screw you Ubisoft I will never buy one of your games again. This is the worst purchase I have ever made and I'm only sorry I convinced 3 people to buy this steaming pile of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ garbage. Such a simple thing... playing online... a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ board game... can't get through one match and the game has been completely broken for 4+ years without the developer fixing or even acknowledging the issue.


I hate this game, it's ♥♥♥♥. The worst game ever. 3 of us had our money stolen because this product is false advertising.

As far as monopoly goes, yeah this is monopoly. However, the online multiplayer is outstandingly broken. 25 - 50% of all online games will end in a game-ending bug. For example:
- When the turn timer expires, it removes the player from the game instead of skipping their turn like a reasonable game
- When a property is auctioned, there is a chance that one or all players cannot bid or withdraw, so they are left to wait out the turn timer
- The turn timer does not stop during trades, so good luck trying to haggle out a deal
- Randomly dropping players

Additionally, there is no way to pause or re-join a game in progress, even if it was just a private game you were playing with your buddies."

Supports just 1 controller on PC, unlike other releases of the same game on other platforms. This perhaps wouldn't be so bad, however the game for local-play was clearly designed for each player to have a controller, the developers failed to notice this when they assumed PC users would be happy to pass a single gamepad around.

You will end up passing the same controller around to each player as you all bid for a property (which requires the player to press either A, X or B to place a bid). This leads to the wrong players pressing buttons, or intentionally bidding for other players.

Redundant and sloppy design on PC."

This game is absolutely infuriating, to be honest. Somehow they messed up Monopoly. Somehow. (Well, the gameplay is fine, it's just... they messed everything else up)

Like I'm sorry to the people who worked on the game but if you can't even make fullscreen work right... what are you doing.
Other things that notably suck about this game:
- We had *2* games just randomly kick us all out after playing an hour+ in both matches. I know network stuff isn't easy but like... if you're going to try and sell this for $15 (or even $5) you better allow us to play a full ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game.
- Blur stuff, like another reviewer brought up, it is very much overused and feels just plain weird. I have my glasses on and can barely see anything here.
- Ubisoft Connect. Ah yes, Ubisoft Connect. The pile of trash that you have to install for every Ubisoft game. Why do you have to make it so painful. Piracy is an option and I think I will start doing it for all Ubisoft games going forward :)
- AI is horrible. I'm also horrible but at least I keep some of the money in the bank.
- I just noticed... this game has Denuvo. Why do you put f**king Denuvo... on ??? WTAF."

monopoly is a very fun and ruthless game about rapidly progressing thru the stages of capitalism to play with friends

so it is absolutely fitting that monopoly plus for steam published by ubisoft is the worst, most poorly made and horribly upmarked piece of trash i've ever played.

this game doesnt function. if you try to play on a board with too much graphical load the game will crash. if you get kicked out of the lobby you have to restart the game. sometimes, the game will crash for absolutely zero given reason. the servers are powered by an old man enslaved at ubisoft HQ to turn an old rusted crank whenever someone across the globe tries to set up a lobby. YOU HAVE TO SIGN UP FOR UPLAY.

dont buy this for yourself. dont buy this for your friends, and dont even play it if given for free, because then you will have to put you and several of your friends thru torture of trying to get the netcode to function just long enough to get put in the gutter cuz someone rolls advance to boardwalk."

Ubisoft really knocks this one out of the park. The servers are ♥♥♥♥. Multiplayer games with friends get disconnected 40 minutes in and have you feeling like you wasted your life.

6 hours in and I am left to conclude that this game was made my aliens that have no concept of basic decent game design. A 5 minute timer when hosting a game with friends? Who thinks of that? Not to mention the abysmal controls, lengthy unnecessary animations, and dogsh*t server reliability. You'll hate your friends, the game, and yourself after (trying) to play this. Thank god I bought it on sale. It's not worth the $15 normally.

Update One Game Later: We literally could not finish a nearly 2 hour game because the game got stuck and someone was unable to place a bet for the last house. Absolutely nothing that could be done.

Super buggy game. 0/10 would not recommend. Fun only if you get it to work. Known bugs don't get fixed for years. Seems like a fun game to play with a couple friends but you will probably spend more time just trying to get it to work properly than actually playing. Some of the most serious things I want to point out:

Things that annoy me (not game breaking):
- Volume is always maxed out at 100 when you load the game
- Can't play with multiple rule-sets

Things that actually make this unplayable:
- Random crashes mid-game
- Last House Auction game freeze (100% consistent)
- People getting kicked for connection issues (if 1 player disconnects, why bother playing anymore. Should at least have something where they can rejoin)

These last three points make it so that you rarely finish a game. We finished 2 out of the 8 games we played before I gave up with this poorly designed game.
There was so many more little things that annoyed me but the point is I'm not happy with this game."

This game is incredibly fun. It's Monopoly, in all of its chaotic glory; however, stay away from the game in its current state. In my ~70 hours of playing, my friends and I have had several issues, including:

-Disconnects
-Desyncs (money and houses are not the same across the board - pun fully intended)
-The game flat-out not working due to not allowing us to do any sort of input once landing on a space.

The game is also demanding, for what it is. Play on the default, basic board instead of the city board, and you will see a bunch of frame rate drops and microstutters vanish.

That being said, these issues - performance hiccups not included - do not happen every game, like the reviews would suggest. More often than not, we finish games without issues; however, THE ISSUES ARE FREQUENT ENOUGH THAT THEY ACTIVELY HINDER THE EXPERIENCE. We start the game with baited breath, wondering if the game will work this time.

If they ever decide to patch the game (which they won't), then I could definitely recommend it, at least on sale. But again, definitely not in its current state."

I spent like an hours, trying to playing the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game and i ran into countless bugs and glitches which makes the game not even entertaining anymore. this game is equivalent to a hooker's std ridden anus."
monopoly+plus,Not Recommended,4.5,"Posted: December 28, 2019
My friend bought this for me because we all wanted to play a good game of Monopoly. However, what I soon found was that this is the most abhorrent monstrosity of a file to ever be allowed onto my computer.

Firstly... the music, sounds, and the narrator are so annoying--I have never been closer in my life to lodging a .45 into my temple because of such a violation of my auditory senses. Thankfully the game warms you up to these noises, by prepping your ears with by far the loudest, most excruciating, most groin-wrenching noise humans can detected at launch. This is, ironically, accompanied by the epilepsy seizure warning they included. I imagine that warning is there to tell you that the noise and visuals you are about to experience are about to inflict such a disorder unto you in the next mere seconds. Once you read that warning: throw off your headset across the room and jump for cover or else risk your hearing for the rest of your life.

Secondly, this is such a poorly crafted application, this ♥♥♥♥ crashes so often it makes Paul Walker and Queen Diana look like NASCAR superstars; and to remind you... **this is Monopoly**. The only other game I have had crash on me that I can remember is DayZ. Additionally, you have to install Uplay to make this, which, as we know, is the equivalent to exposing your poor innocent computer to every STD known to man. This may make some scoff but I kid you not, my friends and I, after only ONE GAME, had several overlay bugs that caused Uplay messages to be burned into our monitors which wouldn't go away until we forced quit the applications. I am sure if I continued to play these messages theses overlay bugs would be burned into my retinas because this file is so contagious.

Additionally, the gameplay is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ garbage. You may be asking yourself, ""Huh? How could they mess up Monopoly lol?"" so how they ruined the gameplay is by requiring you to verify that you're not AFK every 10 seconds. Maybe this works for online against random people, but when you're playing with friends it's like I'm being treated in the ICU--the application is constantly checking if I'm still alive and if I'm not it ejects me from the game and replaces me with a bot. I cannot even begin to describe with the limitations of my carbon based carnation how infuriating it is to be in the middle of a game with pretty high stakes only to be replaced with a bot who then decided to put mortgages against my property and spend all my money like a psycho ex-wife.

I truly regret the past three hours of my life that led up to this review.
I urge you, dear reader, if it is not too late: do not purchase this game. Even if this game is offered to you for free: run. Run as far as you can. Only if you are comfortable receiving this hex of a game to haunt you and your bloodline for the rest of your existence: continue to checkout for this cursed entity."

I have 3.8 hours of play time with 3.7 of them waiting in the game lobby for my friends to join. Ubisoft took a simple game and ruined it with it's broken menus. The fact the a private lobby is timed for 5 minutes is ridiculous. It takes 15 minutes for everyone to troubleshoot the issues of Uplay. After 2 hours of trying to play with 5 people, all of us experienced 7 different issues. I would rather buy the actual board game, go to a quarantined house of COVID patients and play with them then play this version."

Do. Not. Buy. This. Game.
You want to play monopoly with your friends? Please try a knock off on a website somewhere or meet in person.
This game is pathetic from the bottom up. Requires log in to buggy and useless ubisoft account that nobody wants. If you want to play with your friends they'll all NEED to get an account as well, no way to connect through steam.
You want options? You can pick one of like 6 options when you start a game. THATS IT. Why you cant form a lobby and select multiple options is beyond me.
Arguably the worst part of this experience was the connection issues. I have yet to finish a game of monopoly (and I've played for 4 hours). This isn't due to the comically long games that can occur whilst playing monopoly, no. Rather every game I've played has been ended within the hour due to a disconnect. No save feature, no way to get back in. If you can even connect to one another in the first place. Ubisoft tells me to port forward to connect to other players. What is this 2011? These issues were relevant a decade ago, other developers have got their s**t together by now.

In summary, the only reason I'm writing this review is because I could not refund it as I had gone over the time limit for a refund trying to play 4 games of monopoly. Do not recommend as strongly as I can."

I love monopoly. Always have and always will. But this game takes on a whole new level of stupidity and frustration. Not because my friends and family are ripping money out of my hand or buying every property on the board before I can. No that's not it. It's the constant crashing and disconnecting of the game, thus then lets AI bots to take the place of the friends or family who have crashed to 100% screw over the game plan of ever player in the current game. The bots are too stupid to understand what a good or bad deal is. Sometimes the bots even band together against you, the players. And just make this not alright. I am sick and tiered of crashing, having my friends con my now AI bot and take all my properties from me as I am trying to connect back in to the game but once I am back I have nothing left to my name or the bot made me go bankrupt when I could have sold properties.

Sorry for the long review but it had to be said. Would I recommend this game to others? Yes I would but will inform them it's extremely buggy and frustrating in itself without your friends having to participate in your games."

- You can not see the current status of the whole board on other players turns
- The game constantly lags
- The AI takes very very long to do each move
- You can't have multiple house rules in one game
- There is obnoxious motion blur and forced perspective blur that gives me a migraine
- You have to use only keyboard because the mouse doesn't properly select items

MONOPOLY PLUS

DO NOT BUY UNTIL THEY'VE FIXED THIS GAME! I will update the review when/if they've patched it.

EDIT (PLEASE READ):

I managed to get through ONE game without crashing. ONE. Also, when I made a thread asking the devs when fixes will be coming, they responded but said the problems i'm facing should only be happening on the console version of the game (what?) They honestly don't care about the game and would rather not have a discussion on why the game is broken and when it will be fixed. On that note alone, you should definitely not buy this game. Save the money and the headache. I am stuck with this game.

Old review below:

So I was about an hour into the game and in the lead and then BAM! Game shut down. It's really disheartening to play this game knowing that at any time it could shut down, you can't rejoin, and you essentially lose. Please fix this game!

You cant see the rules before the game starts. There is no punishment for leavers. AI plays without mind, they are trading very valueable places for worthless places. The player who can buy the properties from AI, wins the game. Also you cant put AI to your own game so you cant play it as a single player. There are too many connection problems, sometimes it says game host is disconnected and you will be directed to lobby. When you somehow join the game again, you realised that AI took your place and did something stupid, also you are not able to play instead of AI player. This game is totally garbage, i tried to refund it but they didnt accepted. There is no list of game lobbies also, mostly i played with 2 other player randomly. I never see more than 4 people in a game."

The game is very good in concept and when running smoothly the game it totally worth the money you paid, but here's the problem...

YOU CAN'T FINISH A SINGLE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ GAME.

It is absolutely ridiculous that this game has been out for 1 and a half years and they still haven't fixed ANY of the game breaking bugs that consist of AI freezing, players not being able to do anything and random moments of players being kicked from the game.

Almost every long game you play ends up in some sort of game breaking bug, which is a massive problem considering that most monopoly games will last a VERY long time. Almost every time me and my friends play, it always ends in a bug which ultimately makes us determine a winner VIA words and not in the actual game.

You can't make users buy something that seems to be a cheaply put together game that SHOULD be free-to-play.

I bought this game in spite of the bad reviews as I loved monopoly and I wanted a digital version. However, the negative criticisms are mostly correct. After I learnt how the AI worked, this game became incredibly boring as I knew how to win every game. This was true also on the hardest settings. The living board is interesting but like all things, the novelty wears off. It may be useful if you are playing against human players but if you prefer to play single player like me, or want a digital version of the game, then leave it on its digital shelves gathering dust."

I'm a longtime Steam player, first time reviewer. I feel compelled to review this game, though, because I want to let any Monopoly fans out there know that this is not the electronic version you should get. Just get the mobile app. It's cheaper, the gameplay's snappier, there's no obnoxious condescending voice reminding you that ""smart investors don't give up,"" and there are far fewer animations and gimmicks that bog down the gameplay with the mobile version. I spent $6 for this version on sale, but the mobile version was $1.99 normally, yet the mobile game is at least twice as good as this one.

Monopoly is one of the most popular board game in the world, and I don't think I need to explain what kind of game it is.
This is by far the most beautiful looking Monopoly game out there and so it was a “must have” for me no matter what the reviews were saying.
I was excited when this game came on steam, especially because of the multi-player option.

While playing, I figured out that I have played this game wrong my entire life.
I personally don't like the fact that when I land somewhere I'm forced to buy a street even if I don't want it.
You either buy it for the full price or you do an auction.
That means I can give it really cheap to a different player.
Whenever I'm low on money I'm also forced to do an auction, This means I can give the most expensive streets for basically free.
You can change certain rules, But sadly this one isn't part of it.

Unlike most people in the reviews, I haven't experienced any bugs or crashes.
It ran smoothly, and I was surprised by the many cute animations.

Sadly I personally didn't enjoy the game because of the above reason.
I would have played it more often if I could change that rule.
But this is my own opinion and that has nothing to do with how the game runs or how it originally should be played.
Therefor i still recommend this game."

You've got to put effort in to screw up Monopoly...

Luckily, screwing up stuff is Ubisoft's favorite hobbie, first of all, I can't believe I can run Yakuza 0, GTA V and many modern games flawlessly while I get massive FPS drops playing Monopoly, It's a poorly optimized mess.

There are only 3 boards, a far cry from ""Monopoly Streets"" for the Wii, which had over 10 different themed boards.

You can't skip the CPU's moves, that mixed with the poor fps this game sports turns this game into a migraine factory...

The multiplayer frequently crashes and I couldn't finish even one game in almost 10 hours of gameplay...

The only good thing is the personality of the tokens and little more. Probably would say the same about the boards, but that's dragged down by the little variety, so the boards get stale pretty quickly

And if that's not enough, damn this is overpriced as hell..."
monopoly+plus,Not Recommended,2.0,"Posted: June 22, 2018
The game is fun, even in local multiplayer but there are a few drawbacks that build up when you play it for longer:
- The announcer can't be switched off and you have to wait through their repetetive lines. You can lower the volume but you still have to wait out the end of each ""monologue"".
- You can't interrupt the dice throw animation either.. that's not so bad because it's kind of funny but it still gets a bit old eventually.
- When making an offer to another player, you can only increase and decrease the money offered in single digit increments.

Also, when I went from fullscreen to a windowed mode, I couldn't move the window. There was no winow title bar within the visible area of my screen.

This game has some mind boggling design decisions.

Starting your game, you'll be greeted by an incredibly loud intro music that cannot be turned down. Your volume settings only apply after you're in the main menu.


The game is also very unstable. I've played five games by now, and two of them have ended in a crash or a connection problem.

To summarize, this game has been designed by incompetent hacks, and coded by interns.

At least, 80% of the games I played ended up with a crash, either from my side, or from other people's side. For some reason, they decided to focus on graphics for a board game, instead of the gameplay itself, and the stability of the multiplayer. Do not buy please. 5/10."

Okay look, I'm usually a very patient man. My mom constantly brags about me to my neighbors cause I'm just an overall nice and humble boy. But today.......... I felt like cussing my mom out about your servers. A few of my friends got disconnected and a freaking AI named ""Anthony"" took over and his ass decided to disconnect as well. You tell me, an in-game AI disconnects from its own servers. Covid has killed a lot of people this year but if everyone in the world played this game then Ubisoft servers would have a higher kill count than Covid. I asked my friend if what I just said was too much, to which he replied ""nah man its just facts"". Ubisoft I love you, actually wait no I don't. The only game you can make is Assasin's Creed and you screwed that up too.

Not worth 40$

Mid game sadly, The RTS aspects of it are severely under balanced and there's not much for you to do after you beat the campaign. In the campaign mobs don't really fit a specific archetype and you can just throw anything at anything. There is a lack of underlying strategy in the game. Even then once you unlock redstone launchers, it turns the game and makes it unbelievably easy. In your campaign world there's nothing to do after you beat the game as well.

Pvp:
The pvp isn't that good because nobody knows what they're doing and seemingly if you just rally enough troops after placing a few upgrades the game is over. I haven't had any matches which were long or difficult.

Monetization?:
Game is not worth 40$.. full stop. If there comes paid DLC.. not worth it either. It took me 12 hours to beat the campaign on normal difficulty. I spent extra time fortifying the WellSpring (do not do this it will get deleted by the final boss.) And i also collected a bunch of the power towers. All useless."

>>If you are on the fence about this title Steam allows you to refund a game as long as you have 2 hours or less in it! Grab a copy and give it a go, you're going to make reasonable progress in two hours easily and be able to tell if its your cup of tea or not. It's also on Xbox~PC Game Pass for maybe 12USD a month? Check with Discord friends, they probably have free trials for Game Pass in their gift inventory on Discord.<<

Honestly it's a pretty fun and cute little game. You lazy-harvest some resources, you quick spawn some units and buildings, you run around razing a bit of hell here and there. It's just enough action to be fun, just enough base building to be comfy, and just the right dash of Pikmin-like army logic to make you think.

It's a Minecraft spinoff, it's aimed at the younger players more than the older players but the older players will have some fun here too I feel, I know I did and I've been happily enjoying Minecraft since 2009!

Also Blackbird Interactive is the team behind the most recent Homeworld game (DoK) and the upcoming Homeworld 3, and I have complete faith in their ability to make a comfy child-friendly RTS-like game.

Oh and before anyone panics about any concerns of it ""being too easy"" the game starts your first world off on the easiest difficulty ""Fabled,"" swap to ""Mythic"" for a more common difficulty curve.

I'll be editing as I go:

The banter and characters are cute. Despite the bad scenario going down the world you're trying to save is basically Minecraft Peaceful but enemy mobs spawn and just want to exist. All interactions between the non-Piglins is pleasant and fun, lots of laughing and cheer with lots of comfy vibes.

The controls are more than simple so I'm not really sure the complaining so far unless maybe someone has a rough time with the keyboard. You have your few keys to hit right next to each other for what building category you want to hit, you have two main buttons to hit to command or call your army to you, and everything else is easily hit even in the middle of a fight. This isn't ARMA levels of needing to know how to keybind in the slightest bit.

The world is vast and pretty for campaign though it also supports coop so this would make sense. PVP worlds are quite a bit smaller for obvious reasons but campaign things take time to get between though there is a portal system that just speeds everything up from what I've been told.

At this point I am experiencing no bugs to speak of. Sounds work, FPS is great, keys all working, mouse response is fine, everything doing what it visibly should be doing as far as I can tell, no visual glitches, alt-tabbing just fine, no disconnects, no audio popping, literally zero bugs at this time. I've seen some people clamoring ""oh it's a half-bake launch, blah blah"" but honestly I'm not experiencing a single problem like I've been seeing in reports. Please be sure to mention bugs found in the Steam forums though and I have no doubt that Microsoft will do their best to help out with getting them solved, but good chance they are more clientside than global bugs.

Sounds are great, music is cozy, I think forty dollars is honestly a fair price.

If anyone has personal questions feel free to put them in the comments and I'll do my best to answer.


Possible final edit:

Alright so I beat the campaign, took me about 13ish hours. I had a great time, sure it was a bit sloggish after a while as the gameplay is straightforward but I still had a great time all the same. Ending of course left just enough of a ""what if"" cliffhanger so I'm sure they'll try to do some more story stuff down the line."

Not recommended, at least for now. I can't speak to the campaign mode--I tried it briefly and it seems fine?--but they really messed up the PvP. Most importantly:

YOU CANNOT HAVE YOUR FRIENDS ON YOUR TEAM in public games.

Invite them into your lobby > half will be assigned to the opponent team. So even if you have 3 friends on, and invite them all in, the lobby will configure itself to be 2 of you versus 2 other of you, and when you search, it'll add random players to the other four slots, two per team.

No voice chat, no real ping system, YOUR TEAMMATES CAN UNBUILD YOUR UPGRADES.

Maybe in a week or two there'll be a great patch to fix some of this stuff, but for now, don't buy if you are here for the PvP."
minecraft+legends,Recommended,34.5,"Posted: April 21
As a guy who grew up playing Starcraft 1 & 2, this isn't the best RTS out there but it's trying... sorta

This game has its issues, like I feel like the campaign could use a little more variety in some things like random events of some sort to spice it up other then, Siege a base and Defend a village.

The unit variety is fine but could use some more stuff like maybe they could bring in the Iron Golem for some sort of Heavy Infantry like unit or add the spiders. Small thing but it can be better.

I wish the player character had more upgrades for them specifically, like your gonna be in the heat of battle most of the time so why not add an unlock-able ranged attack option or the ability to repair buildings with an upgrade. small things to let the player interact with their base and world more ya know? of course I understand that some of those mechanics might get delegated to campaign only but hey, can make campaign more interesting atleast.

Multiplayer has some Desync issues here and there but its not the worst and happens rarely for me.

I do see the problem and dislike for the Cosmetic store and I do agree its not a great thing but in the long term its not the worst thing here, its all optional cosmetics and can be ignored if you wish.

The worse thing with the game imo is the fact the game has too little content for it to be worth 40$. The campaign is not super long and pretty repetitive. I feel like they ride on the fact its a randomly generated world on each new save a bit much, while that adds some replayability, its not a great value with the campaign in its current state.

As for the PvP, I haven't done that yet so I wont leave an opinion here as it wouldn't be right.

But despite its problems, its still pretty damn fun for me as a casual. Its far from perfect but the Campaign being co-op is really fun and I enjoy coordinating sieges with my friends.

Though are if you want to buy it, wait until its on sale imo. 15-20$ I feel is what its proper price should be with its current content. Overtime I'm sure they will add more things but if those are required to make the game feel worth the 40$, the game shoulda been delayed a bit.



Overall not the worst RTS game but not the best either, kinda middle of the road and I feel the current Mixed Ratings is correct.

Oh and the game is cross platform so there is that, def was a selling point for me since I have some friends who only have PC and others that only of an Xbox, PS, or a Switch. So this was added to the small pile of games where my friend group can all hang out together.



P.S. I do recommend reading other reviews, you were probably already gonna do that but I just want to ensure you get informed of any other pros and cons the game has."

It's graphically charming the game functions for the most part, but it feels very hollow.

It feels like an RTS in name only. The outposts you build are usually just going to be for fast travel purposes. The villages already make resources for you. Due to how enemy mobilizes (or rather, how they don't mobilize) their armies in this game, you don't have to really think about building outposts to hold off the enemy from occupying a space or to cut them off from resources. Besides the attack and occasional new base every night, the piglin army are just sitting there waiting for you.

In terms of action and combat tactics the game also feels very limited. Defensively, the upgrades you can get to your building feel like they're just an afterthought when just spamming walls and arrow towers already suffices. Offensively, it's just a cycle of leading a bunch of stone golems to rush a few buildings in the enemy base, retreating to make more, and then bringing out your creepers to nuke the nether portal when the enemy's defenses are down.

Where I think the game could've salvaged itself was to have a lot of interesting side content in the world and a good campaign. Sadly, I found that the game failed on both these fronts too. Besides some admittedly helpful mounts, you just find some resources laying around + some golems and towers that I really never got much use out of. The story feels like it's aimed strictly at an extremely young audience. Nearly all the cutscenes featuring the horde being the exact same joke of a commander Piglin bullying the smaller ones. Your allies has scripts written on wooden that hasn't been turned to paper yet, with only one of them even attempting to say even slightly amusing things and still fumbling at that."

Pretty disappointing gameplay. Voice acting is unbearably annoying as well as some pretty tame gameplay.

Cute concept for a cute game, however it feels a bit messy to control units and at the end of the day it's neither tactical enough or simple/fun enough to justify buying the game.

I would rather have a beat em all type of gameplay or a full-on tactical game but the mix of both doesn't work quite as well as I had hoped. Basically as soon as you have sent your units where you want you just mash the sword attack (which is way too strong for its own good) and can clear almost any mob on your own repeating the same attack over and over.

Again the concept is cute on paper, but the execution feels too shallow for the more hardcore crowd and I could see the game being way too complex to control for kids."

My biggest problem right now is the structure limit. I know I'm not the only one. I don't think the game told me about it until I ran into the ""Too many structures"" error. The thing is, like some others, I made triple layers walls so that the enemies have a hard time getting through. Apparently each individual wall counts as a structure. So, if you triple layers walls, you'll only be able to do that for a smaller area because you'll eventually run into the ""structure limit"" and you won't be able to place any towers or other defenses. I found this out 10 hours into the game and now I can't get a refund because I've played for more than 2 hours. Also, this is just one out of multiple other problems I've had with this game but this ""Too many structures"" error just did it for me. Hopefully, this one little review out of thousands of others will contribute to the devs fixing the problems so many people are running into."

It appears as if reviews for this game are mixed... Mixed as in split between people who came to it for the RTS side, and people who only came for the Minecraft side.

This game is very much, an RTS game. it's convoluted nature is commonplace with alot of RTS out there, and due to the attempt at being toned down, It most likely won't be as bad as other RTS games. I'd say the co-developer 'Blackbird Interactive' are trustworthy, as they seem to have developed games such as Homeworld 3 and Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak.

The main complaint is the lack of content, I saw someone saying that the campaign lasted for 2 hours, which is abnormal since it took me an hour and a half to even complete the tutorial? but the game does change from a storied linear pattern to a open world RTS where you defend against a 'Dynamic' enemy. so they might of thought that the game ended once the tutorial finished.

In terms of outside the length of the campaign, it's a live service game. I'm gonna expect more stuff to come in the future. hopefully in the form of free updates, with income generated from the marketplace instead of DLC. but for now, it is slightly limiting on unit choices, with only 8 standard units, excluding 'Super' units. but as with all RTS games. units are for purpose, rather than just to exist. so there might be no need for other units, as most RTS game's basic spam units are basically the same amount, going for upgrades or stronger units later to add diversity. It's not something you should care about if you're going into this for an RTS game.

I however have one issue with the game, that has the possibility of not being fixed, and that's the AI in this game. the AI is workable. but 'Stupid' you tell them to go attack a base across lava with a bridge beside you, they'll go into the lava unless the bridge is directly in front.

There's no 'Call all troops to follow you' button though. which, I can't decide whether it's a positive or a negative. Singleplayer, it's tedious and annoying. Multiplayer however, it allows for both players to micromanage an army as the other player can control the army that's not following you. the recall button on a spawner seems to only recall those not following others though. so in the middle of an attack move, your guys may vanish.

In summery, the game has a few faults. which are commonplace for RTS games, and will be manageable for those who actually play RTS games. So I'd totally recommend this game to those who do play RTS games."
minecraft+legends,Not Recommended,49.4,"Posted: April 26
Honest review.
Cons:
The campaign on the recommended difficulty (2nd lowest) takes around 8-12 hours to complete. Higher difficulties just have more starting piglin bases and they only do slightly more damage. After you finish the campaign there is no reason to play your world anymore. You cannot build for style (only like 12 buildings for defensive and the rest are for upgrades). While there's plenty of units you can control most of them are passive mobs (wolves etc.) that cannot attack buildings. The 8 spawnable mobs and 4 legendary ones don't offer alot in the way of customizable armies. I found I was constantly just making armies of one or two units depending on what I was fighting. Every base you destroy feels super repetitive. PvP is more about making a base near you enemies right off the bat and then attacking as soon as your able. Massive lack of strategy in its current state.

Pros: Game is light hearted and the graphics are beautiful and computer friendly. There are many pieces of minecraft lore spread around that gives depth to the minecraft timeline. The controls takes a while to get used to but once you learn them it becomes second nature. Super good filler game (for those times where you can't get a full online game in, except PVP can last awhile depending on the teams understanding of the game). Cross platform play suggests that the companies are going to expand the pvp. So far its not pay to win. There are micro transactions for cosmetics for your character and mounts, but it would be nice if there were skins for buildings too.

Overall I wouldn't say its isn't worth the $50 especially if you aren't interested in co-op or pvp. The single player aspect is lackluster to say the least. While I enjoyed the experience, I can't help feeling disappointed in the game. I've sat in the menu and thought ""what is there to do thats fun"" and then closed the game multiple times. I would suggest waiting for more content for both single player and PVP."

The game seemed to be advertised for a singleplayer or co-op experience but the campaign is very shallow and short, but the PVP is awful and simply just not fun. The PVE can be very fun, hectic and intense, and will be fun for the few hours of playtime it has to offer. It seems like the idea was there but the execution is just not that great. I did greatly enjoy my time with what was on offer but it simply did not feel as a complete experience. That alongside the audacity of them to launch the game with a micro transaction shop for a game that has less longevity than most 10 euro indie games makes it so I simply cannot recommend the game in this state."

multiplayer sucks.

Pros:
1. the game looks incredibly pretty and the cutscenes are funny and well animated and on my quite bad computer it runs REALLY well!

2. the game is VERY fun (but that could be biased, you might find it more fun then i did or less fun.)

3. the game can be incredibly fun with your friends if you can get some that is.

Cons:
1. lack of content.
for the 40$ price tag the campaign is not worth it. its a fun game but its just not THAT fun. only worth it if you can get a bunch of friends to play with you but thats a MAJOR task by itself as your friends also need to spend 40$ on the game in order to play it. you'll only get around 10 to 12 hours of total playtime out of the campaign which is NOT WORTH IT FOR 40$ EACH PERSON.

2. PVP is awful, worst part of the game byfar.
pvp in public servers is god awful as nobody knows what they're doing and there is NO WAY TO COMMUNICATE WITH ONE ANOTHER BESIDES PINGING LOCATIONS ON THE MAP WHICH IS AWFUL.
PVP would be MASSIVELY IMPROVED if there was some way to communicate but for right now its not worth it AT ALL. do not play this if you want the PVP unless you have friends that want to do the PVP because my god its awful in public servers with there being 0 communication.

3. high pricetag.

I had really high hopes for the game since I'm a huuuuge Minecraft fan. But what broke it for me personally are the following points:

- Playing online is really hard to set up. You wait in lobbies forever. People join and leave again and it is really hard to join with your friends. It just doesn't work half the time. Even if you manage, you'll be in the opposite team and not in all modes can you change the team or you have to be super fast and then you wait obviously again because the team size is not equal and then people leave again. There is no way to fill up lobbies with bots or to play with your friends against bots.
- If you you finally manage to get a game going, it's either super short because your teammates leave midgame or it takes up to two hours, which is just not fun. The only reasons i played games that long was because I didn't want to go through the whole waiting for a game process which sometimes took like half an hour already.
- Besides the story mode which was fun at start but then gets repetitive with being very restricted at the same time there is not much not online for single player, like a game with bots or a free game.
- There is no way to communicate with your teammates fast, easily and effectively, which means win or lose for a game where cooperation is key.

It breaks my heart to write that for something Minecraft related. But this game could have been an amazing experience with my friends but it turned out to be annoying daunting. But hopes die last, so I will check in with it in a year and see what has come of it :)"

PRICE
I think the game is kinda over priced $40 a little much (the deluxe edition just gives u like a few extra skins)

MAIN CAMPAIGN
the main campaign is ok its not to bad I would recommend playing it as it teaches the mechanics and what different things do

VERSUS
the versus mode can be very painful (no chat, all resources shared, team leavers common-ish, game will put you in an in-progress game if someone leaves it as well as that people on your team can deconstruct you buildings easily and there is no ranked mode or barrier of entry to versus so some people just don't know what there doing.)

if u want to play versus I would suggest playing with other people your in a voice call with (the Minecraft legends discord server has a looking for group section if u need it although I dont know how well it works)

also it is only 4v4 (in public games) and there is no party system so if u want to play with a friend you have to host a game as that's the only way to make sure your on the same team

LOST LEGENDS
the lost legends (monthly challenges) I think are very fun

FRIENDS
minecraft legends lets your friends join your campaign and your lost legends (although you can make a world private as-well)

MECHANICS
some of the mechanics can be confusing/you might not realize you can use some of them here is a list of somethings that might be easy to forget
1.
in the ctrl menu (hold ctrl) left click will make mobs target a mob/building but will attack other things to while right click will make them only target the mod/building and nothing else, also you have to old right click/left click to send all your mobs and only tap to send one
2.
if you press r it brings up a notebook which you use for rearranging the different hot bar layouts but you can look on the right side of the book and click the feather quill icon to look at what all the things mobs/other things do
3.
on the map (press m) if a piglin base or a village has a sign or a flag over it it means that location will do something at nightfall

WOULD I RECOMMEND?
I would recommend this game to you if you think that the price isn't to bad and if you plan on also playing this game with friends"

The game is overpriced, and the main campaign does not take much time to beat. However, the environments of this game are absolutely phenomenal, the NPCs are adorable (even the Piglins), the cutscenes are worthy of an animation award, and the overhaul experience, from the controls, to the music, and gameplay mechanics, makes this a game I will never forget. Again it is overpriced, however, if you do not mind spending the money, then I absolutely recommend this masterpiece!"

Great game to start, ignore the people talking about how the game is 2 hours long and lacking, they literally didn't even get past that 'tutorial' and just assumed the game is too easy. The game does need work as in AI tracking, because getting them across bridges are a ♥♥♥♥♥ to do, regardless of that the game could use some more units, maybe more fortifications and traps as well as more varied enemies. Basically more of everything, for as much content as we have now, it's fine as is, most people playing who refunded it didn't both to read into the game or get past the tutorial point to experience it fully, or maybe never played an RTS game in their life then just skipped the tutorial dialogue asking 'How do I do this' or crap like that. If you want a semi-complex RTS and you enjoy Minecraft, then I'd recommend this to you."

minecraft+legends,Recommended,14.2,"Posted: April 27
If you like Pikmin's exploration but wish you could build fortifications anywhere and the units had more clear roles in battle, then this is the game's Campaign mode is for you.

Layered walls are clunky to build, but everything else feels polished. I also like how the whole world persists, so you can set troops to finish off a building, quick travel away, and the fight will finish without you present. Co-op mode is also good, just open up a separate chat because you cannot talk in-game. The cut-scenes from starting or ending big fights are charming and help with immersion, but are safe to skip if you are in a hurry."

The game is an interesting idea that incorporates some cute little references to things minecraft players do within their worlds. That being said, the game frankly doesn't have enough depth to warrant the price. The gamplay loop becomes old pretty quickly and the controls aren't all that great, particularly if you are playing with M&K, I'd recommend a controller if you do decide to play."

Positives:
Beautiful art
Visually pleasing cinematics.
versus mode has potential
Very fun to make an attack plan and push your FOB up as you clear a portal like claiming land

Negatives:
$40-$50
Greedy monetization method that pushes it in your face when playing those monthly missions
Skill ceiling abysmally low
no reason to create unique unit composition when you can just spam stone golems and archers
Versus is outright broken, cant chose team, cant join game with friends
Cross platform for steam is entirely broken and barely functioning, directs to error page upon joining
controlling units is frustrating
Buildings too high HP in campaign so its like watching paint dry watching them fight.]
Campaign can be 100% completionist in less than 10 hours (I got all achivements but legendary & versus in 9 hours)
cant comunicate with teamates WHATSOEVER
forced to play 4v4 with no comm idiots.

I could seriously go on forerver with negatives I was extremely excited for this game more than 99% of people, however this was the worst $50 game I've ever purchased. At the $15 game this would be way better. Hey but at least their shop functions.... right?"
minecraft+legends,Not Recommended,0.3,"Posted: April 18
I do not recommend this game, nor believe it's priced at a fair price point.

In agreement with other reviews, it's a very cute RTS game with amazing optimization and a beautiful soundtrack.. however, the gameplay just really fell short for me. The first two missions you're given (save the village or whatever) are the exact same, and really weren't enjoyable to complete. There are also a lot of bugs with multiplayer, and seemingly already hackers.

I've also seen people complain about the control scheme, and others who shame on those who leave such reviews because it's ""super easy"". The truth is, the keyboard controls are terrible.
- They do use keys that are next to one another, but it makes for very confusing gameplay. Example: Holding Q and pressing Q does different things, same with E, then there's ZXCV along with movement WASD and then LM and RM~ it's just a lot for someone (like me) who is looking for a casual RTS experience.
This is coming from someone who enjoys competitive games, and plays KBM in games in which controller players are more dominant (ex: Rocket League).

If you have the money, buy the base game and give it a shot. Don't always base your decisions on reviews, as they're all subjective. Everyone will have a different experience.

However, I would stay away. Lol"
minecraft+legends,Not Recommended,5.7,"Posted: April 19
This game, while great in concept feels lackluster and empty if you played for more than a few hours.

you defend villages, pillage piglin outposts, repeat cycle. the RTS aspects lack strategy of any sort since the game doesn't really give you the tools to do strategy, you just keep running back and forth to yeet newly spawned troops at the enemies until they die or you run out of materials, doesn't really matter what troop type you spawn most of the time. Especially since all your troops are in quote ""The AI is more A than I.""
and because you're technically a ""soldier"" too, the camera is very limited and usually gets in the way of building or troop commanding. I feel like the game would've been good if they committed to doing either action or RTS but not both.

the game could be good if it had like 3x the content variety or more but as it stands I'd say it's not worth more than $15 at a sale, and that's just if you like the idea of playing troop spawning sim with a minecraft paint on it."
minecraft+legends,Recommended,9.8,"Posted: April 19
This game is fun, and I have had a blast playing it. Story is simple, but what do you expect from Minecraft. Gameplay is fun, a very different kind of RTS. Most negative reviews highlight the campaign as being 2 hours, which I believe is the tutorial- you still need to beat all the piglin bases and such in order to ""complete"" the campaign. I haven't tried PvP yet, but it looks pretty solid. All in all, I'd say buy it if you think you'd like it, and if you have any 2nd thoughts, perhaps wait for a sale."
minecraft+legends,Not Recommended,23.6,"Posted: April 29
If you are only interested in the solo campaing, then the game is definitey not worth full price. Open world is really cool but gameplay quickly gets repetitive and has little depth even at highest difficulty.

Multiplayer on the other hand is really fun with the boys. If you manage to get a squad of 3 or 4 players in the same team you will have a lot of fun together playing the game. I wouldn't recommend solo queuing on the other hand. The game requires just too much team work and communication to play with three random 9yo bozos and not tilt."

Crashed immidiately the first 3 times I tried to open it (but worked fine after). Had to put the narration to English multiple times before it was actually in English, even though it was very much set to English in the options the whole time. Managed to get softlocked in the campaign due to random terrain generation creating a piglin base that's higher up than ramps can be built. Combined with the absolutely insane decisions made when they designed the pvp matchmaking (something that's the make-or-break for the longevity of this game), this game clearly has some glaring issues that should not have been in there at launch. I was really excited about this game and want to love it, but I just can't. Super bummend out at how much of a let-down it is, and even more at my playtime ending at just past the 2 hour mark.

I had high hopes for this game. It had a unique concept of recourse gathering, army management, base building, and overall the style of how you control everything. On release the game made it practically impossible to play with friends in public lobbies. The servers were awful nearly crashing every other match. Redstone launcher spamming and the overall tower was just so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ powerful. The tower that counters it has such a small protection range that you need to build several just to block anything, with it being the most high costed unit and building. I can go on and on and on. I have so many hours because I was in denial just trying to make this game enjoyable for myself. This game has such an interesting and amazing concept, sadly the execution was poor, the balance is non existent, and no punishment for making any misplay. Even dying was not punishing. When I was playing, it was meta to run in and suicide bomb with your units. It was quite boring seeing the same strategy over and over and over again."

I'm honestly mixed on this. While I genuinely had fun, there's glaring issues with it that's holding it back, including but not limited to:



GENERAL:
-Primitive pathfinding AI (aren't smart enough to use bridges to cross lava rivers, so you MUST position both yourself & your army across a clear path to ensure they don't do a stupid)
-You can't dismiss or get rid of unwanted units in your army. Only way to do so is to let them die by enemies or by lava.
-Company says they advocate for diversity, yet the skin options consist of 2 warriors of unknown gender in a full knight armor & helmet (face is covered,) 2 black male skins, and 7 female skins, and no white male skins! Where's the diversity?!? Hypocrisy!

SINGLEPLAYER:
-Can't pause single player session
-According to some YouTubers, even Singleplayer sessions operate on a dedicated server. What? Leads to issues where sometimes your character will randomly teleport.

MULTIPLAYER:
-No option to either join a new match or an ongoing match (game lobs you into either one of it's own choosing)
-No chat in a team-based multiplayer game (kid-friendly game is NOT an excuse!)
-Terrible connection optimization: Hero vs hero (player vs player) combat feels terrible, cuz you can die to an enemy that's clearly 200 meters away from you. You're better off sending your own army to fight enemy players.
-Sometimes common resources such as stone are unreasonably scarce
-Matches are an hour long ON AVERAGE



While I will personally continue playing the game, I can't in good conscience recommend this game to other people. It'll probably be of better value if you like strategy game AND the game is on sale for like 50%.

====================

Otherwise this is a pass. If you're looking for good RTS (Real-TIme Strategy games,) I strongly recommend:

The lack of an in-game chat feature isn't that great. Minecraft Dungeons was the same way, and this game is the same exact thing. Such a basic and simple thing any co-op/multiplayer game has nowadays, yet this doesn't have that. Not everyone likes being in a VC playing all the time and tabbing back and forth to Discord all the time just to talk with people that they're playing with.

Other than that, the gameplay loop gets stale and old really fast, really not a fan of how it is in its current state. There's no means of exploration, and this is very lackluster. The only time you're exploring is gathering more recourses or heading towards an objective point in the game, where you're mostly spending your time playing at/around. The shared recourse thing is also a big bummer when playing with people, especially with what I had also said formerly with this review. This is also why being able to better communicate directly inside the game with others that you play with is a must-have, especially where there are public games you can join, not even just friends only. Recourse management can easily just be a mess due to this.

The charm of the game and art is very well done, though, I'll give the game that.

Is the game worth 40 dollars? No. The game is at most a 20 dollar game in its current state. I would say paying as much as Minecraft Dungeons for this would be fair and what I would pay for it. If you're wanting to get this game, then I would hold off or wait for a sale or a price drop to happen, which I'm sure is likely going to happen in the foreseeable future.

There's a lot more I could say and or critique about this game, but don't care much about writing out such a really long review. There are other reviews that already mentioned other things I would have to say that are either wrong or aren't that great about the game anyway. I just hope the devs listen this time around and try to improve upon this game, unlike what unfortunately happened to Dungeons, which had a lot of potential.

Currently as of this time and review I wouldn't recommend this game, but I would love for that to change."
minecraft+legends,Not Recommended,25.8,"Posted: April 18
It's a fun game but it has a lot of issues, campaign is simply just not that interesting or engaging past learning the basics.

Multiplayer PvP is where the game shines but with absolutely no way to communicate with people it's impossible to coordinate or tell people what you need. This leads to simply a rather frustrating experience.

Not to mention there's not a reliable way to play PvP with a friend in a normal 4v4 scenario it's a confusing and once again frustrating experience in order to be on the same team as your friend while still playing 4v4, because you can't switch teams prior to starting the game for some weird reason.

Multiplayer systems and mechanics also feels like they were designed in a LAN setting, with no consideration for how it would carry over to playing with other people across the world.

Players can literally steal your units you are in the process of commanding when you send those units to attack something. I frequently ran into that issue as well as wanting to spawn units but you can't because you reached the 40 unit limit with no idea where those units are.

Add in the fact you cannot under any circumstances communicate with your teammates during the match and it's a recipe for a frustrating experience.

Very good game, but multiplayer feels incredibly bare bones and needs serious work before it's going to be an actual enjoyable experience for those who don't have a group of 7 or 8 people to play with."

I have to say, this game is being negatively reviewed for little to no reason. This is an incredibly fun and charming action strategy game with only minor issues that prevent it from being a great game. I think this is a very good game regardless of any flaws, and a lot of fun overall.

Let me start by saying this, I played through the campaign in co-op, and had such a blast. The world is sprawling, beautiful and has plenty of things to do. On top of that, the map has some element of procedural generation, meaning no two maps will be exactly the same. The beauty of the large open world and the sprawling epic battles with hundreds of units feel absolutely awesome. The sound design is also particularly good, making you feel evermore present in this epic world. We finished it in 15 hours at our own leisure, something we found out that less than 15% of players have done at the time of reviewing this. I just find it baffling that so many people decided to

When you play this game, you will realize that this game doesn't excel past it's peers in either the action or strategy formats. I think this is the wrong lens to view this game through. It's the way that this game combines elements of both genres that feels great. This type of gameplay might have a niche audience, but for that niche, I think it's going to be absolutely awesome.

In terms of strategy, this game offers a limited number of buildings and units to the player, however, what it does well, is it makes everything in the sandbox useful. Every unit has it's place and time to be used effectively. Every building is the same.

When exploring the map, each point of interest is going to be an important factor in slowly stopping the Piglin hordes. You can find special golem units, special towers and extra resources for some crucial upgrades you will need to use back at homebase, the Well of Fate. There are a wealth of resources, and you will need these to slowly expand your arsenal as the piglins get evermore destructive. Some of the epic sieges took an hour to complete.

Another thing you will notice about this game that I think differentiates it a little, is how much this game emphasises temporary structures. The game is about slowly expanding your battle lines and in the process you will lose plenty of buildings, all while slowly gaining ground. It's quite fast paced. In co-op, this works great as the game offers so many ways for players to work together, even while being on the opposite sides of the world.

As for negatives, I didn't like the limited number of structures that could be built at the well of fates. While I understand the need to limit the number of units in the game, everything else should have been relatively unlimited in my opinion. On the flipside, with the structures offered, the current gameplay for the campaign felt well balanced.

Another negative is the potentially stupid AI. Countless times the units miss the bridges you built and fall off. This wasn't too big of an issue, but a minor nuisance nonetheless.

There were also minor bugs and some minor issues with the controls which can be a bit finicky at times.

I think the biggest error for this game was the marketing. Frankly, most people had no idea what this game was even after the first 2-3 trailers. I had the benefit of listening to reviews before purchasing this product. I knew exactly what I was getting, and got exactly what the reviewers I listen to said I would get. I feel like the same can't be said for some others. I think people should take the negative reviews with a grain of salt and go and watch actual reviews for the game on Youtube before deciding if this game could be for them.

Aside from this, had a really positive experience. Look forward to upping the difficulty before another run through the campaign."

Update: After finishing the game (spam zombies ez) the game does get better to an enjoyable state, however it is most certainly nowhere near the value of £44.90 and not that amazing. Dungeons is as of right now £21.09 which is in value far superior, includes the OST (FLAC and MP3) and also a more enjoyable game with a quality Steam port, it feels complete compared to this.

If you're truly interested in Legends, WAIT FOR A SALE otherwise you'll may come out of this feeling like you were robbed of time and money.

Since my original review the game now works on Steam Deck/Linux using Proton Hotfix (auto selected) and runs quite fine (which is to be expected since the game uses Bedrock Engine).

And a little note, Microsoft / Xbox Game Studios Minecraft Java & Bedrock on Steam would be a lovely addition, especially for Bedrock on Steam Deck and to finally have the ability to use Cloud Saves.



Original Review:

If you have almost the same amount of graphical options as Alpha 2 of Minecraft Pocket Edition (12~ years of regression) for a Steam Port then something is going horribly wrong.

Minecraft Legends isn't a great game, at least not 2 and a half hours in.

It all simply comes down to the absolutely terrible tutorial which tells you everything up front and and rapidly with tons and tons of text boxes for about 1 and a half hours. It is a complete information overload and in the end left me completely confused. I am hoping that once I have played more I will come to understand things a lot better and that I will start to enjoy this.

And we also have, monetisation!!! The game is £45 and there's still more DLC in game that you buy with Minecoins, BRILLIANT! Thank you Mojang I sure do want to buy horse armour! And even if you do buy some Minecoins there is no Minecraft (Bedrock) on Steam to spend them on so hoorah I have to adventure down into the depths of hell known as the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Microsoft Store and to hope it actually works (it doesn't).

Terrible first impression.

Game does not work on Steam Deck currently."

I'm having a lot of fun playing it this far despite it's janky controls, I would love to see more unit spawner variations and an easier way to command your units around, having to be directly next to them to issue a command makes it hard to fight on multiple fronts especially when splitting your units to focus different things. The building system can use a little work as it feels slow and trying to build up quickly during say for example the challenges is quite hard, it feels a little ""too floaty"". All in all tho despite it's current problems I'm having a lot of fun with it!"

I am putting this game as not recommended. The game itself has no bugs I am aware of, the game play is repetitive, but it's definitely the co-op that ruins this game. It's laggy, the army system and resource system is atrocious, and the game overall gets repetitive even with a friend. Me and my friend were playing this game for a few hours yesterday, and it ended leaving him thinking it was great, I on the other hand thought different. The co-op makes you share EVERYTHING. The two main things are the resources, and your army. You can only spawn up to 20 units where we are right now, and we have to share them. So, we can only have 10 each, and we can't change them up ever because the game doesn't let you despawn them. I found myself needing different ones because I was trying some new ones out, but I couldn't, because they had to die first. Even if you aren't commanding them, they are still considered apart of your army. Plus, the resources also get shared, so we have to work on everything together, we can't work on separate things. Last thing is that the story is about the worst thing ever. Normally I wouldn't care considering this is a Minecraft spin off, but it was advertised as an epic tale or something like that. In reality, it's all told at the start, Piglins invade overworld, you defend overworld, that's it. The whole game is just attacking bases for long periods of time, riding over to the next one, attack that base, rinse and repeat. Then, if you thought it couldn't get any worse, there's a shop, with minecoins. This shop will be where you buy DLC, or just new skins. I ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hate the windows minecraft shop, so this just brings it down even more. Overall, this game is decent at best, but I personally think its pretty bad. They did not put any effort into the game it feels like. One last thing, do not buy the deluxe edition if you do buy it. You get an extra skin for 10 bucks more, and the skin is horrid. 2/10"

I've never written a comprehensive Steam review for a game, but then again, I've never been so pissed off by a game, either.

Sonic Origins is the biggest letdown imaginable. Before I get into that, though, let's talk about the good parts of the game.

The new Anniversary Mode lets you play through all four games with infinite lives. It's pretty well-known that lives, as a mechanic, kind of suck. They're a holdover from the era of arcade games, made to squeeze money out of you back then and to squeeze playtime out of you on consoles. Lives are replaced with Coins, which you can use to retry Special Stages or unlock art/music/video content in the new Museum.

The cutscenes before and after every game in Anniversary Mode are, likewise, really cool! They clearly had a lot of heart put into them. Tyson Hesse and Powerhouse knocked them out of the park.

The new Mirror Mode lets you play each game in reverse, flipping the screen and changing the game from left-to-right to right-to-left. This is a cool new touch that mixes up the gameplay for veteran players. It's neat.

The also-new Mission Mode throws you into courses with set objectives. This is essentially identical to Sonic Generations' missions - you have set objectives (time, rings, etc.) and you're ranked based on how well you complete those objectives. This is... fine.

That's the end of the good part of Sonic Origins. Now for the bad.

Sonic 1, Sonic CD, and Sonic 2 are almost entirely unchanged from their mobile ports (and Steam port, in CD's case), with a few exceptions that I'll get to later. If you bought and played these earlier ports, though, you might notice something strange about Sonic Origins - namely, at launch, Sonic 1 and 2 on mobile devices were both 3$ a pop, and Sonic CD on Steam was 5$ before it was delisted. Origins is . If you're being generous and want to bump the other two games' prices up to match CD's price S3&K similarly, this game should be 20$ maximum. This alone is ridiculous. On top of that, there's a confusing and predatory-feeling bit of DLC that gives you exactly two pieces of meaningful content - 100 Coins (seriously?) and access to harder missions in Mission Mode. Sega's really going out of their way to nickel and dime you on this one.

Sega also did a lot of advertising relating to ""new playable characters"", which is a flat-out lie. Tails and Knuckles have been playable in Sonic 1 since 2013, and Tails has been in CD since 2011. They couldn't even bother adding Knuckles to CD here, which would've been the easiest ""new character"" to add... but the promotional material and in-game movies focusing on Amy makes me think who they wanted people to assume was playable.

of the aforementioned ""few exceptions"" to the unchanged ports made the games overall. Sonic 1 features the addition of the Drop Dash, except you can't turn around in midair after using it and jumping, so you can't chain it the way you can in Mania. Sonic CD has had Sonic and Amy's single, half-second voice lines removed for... some reason; the Drop Dash was added here, too, and it works much closer to Mania's version.

CD has also had its entire Steam achievement list nixed in favor of Origins's mediocre ""Play the game! Time travel once! Beat Metal Sonic! Beat the game!"" ... and that's . Normally, I'd call this a nitpick, but CD's Steam port from had a better achievement list. Why, Sega. Why.

Sonic 2 has Sonic 1's halfassed Drop Dash, as well as at least two minor level layout changes - one in Metropolis 3 that makes a set of spikes borderline unavoidable (seriously!), and one that breaks Wing Fortress's intro. Good job, Sega.

Sonic 3 & Knuckles is the most tragic case of all here. Sega contracted Headcannon (of Sonic Mania and Sonic 1+2 Mobile fame) to develop the remaster, which sounds all well and good... until you read about how Headcannon was treated during development.

S3&K's good features include the Drop Dash ( implemented this time, likely since Headcannon actually knows how it ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ works), a bunch of additional rotation sprites for objects like the Marble Garden spinners and Carnival Night's barrels, and a few new flashy level transitions that add a lot of polish and heart to the game. Thanks, Headcannon.

S3&K's not present in the original game are numerous, to say the least. Its music hasn't been remastered at all; the tracks sound like low-quality playbacks of the Genesis tracks. It bears mentioning that this only stands out so much because the other three games high-quality remastered tracks. The Special Stage music doesn't speed up to match Sonic's speed like it did in the original game, and the new Super Sonic theme is to listen to, almost as bad as the original.

Actually, none of the new music is good. I'm no Michael Jackson purist, either; I played Sonic 3 A.I.R. with all of the prototype tracks enabled, and they all sounded fantastic there. ; the tracks he wrote should've been arranged and programmed into the game by someone who's more familiar with Genesis sound synthesis. The tracks that made it into Origins are watered-down, inferior versions of the original, pre-MJ tracks.

Miscellaneous annoying differences from the original S3&K include differing in-game physics (hold down when Marble Garden 1 starts and keep it held - the speed cap behaves differently so you fly into a wall, unlike in the original); the end of Act 1 signposts not falling in the same places, so they don't unearth monitors consistently anymore; a vine in Angel Island 2 forcing you to swing into spikes and take damage; an unnecessary vertical screen lock during Marble Garden 2's falling-ceiling section; and the Super transformation animation not halting you in midair, which cancels it in certain circumstances.

I wanted to like this. Sonic 3, in particular, is one of my favorite games of all time; as it stands, though, I can't recommend this garbage fire of a ""remaster"" to anyone. Sega hasn't learned anything from their previous mistakes, and they've now stained Headcannon's reputation by forcing an unfinished product to meet an unneeded deadline. Mania was delayed on PC to add ♥♥♥♥♥♥ DRM back when it released - why couldn't Sega have done the same here to let Headcannon actually finish and polish their game?

This is especially insulting given the runaway success of Sonic Mania. Sega didn't touch that game - they published it, sure, but Christian Whitehead, Headcannon, and PagodaWest were the actual . Sega themselves can't even handle rereleasing the ports previously released by Christian and Headcannon, let alone developing an actual ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Sonic game on their own, as evidenced by the past few years of blunders. It feels like Sega thought they earned some goodwill with Mania, thought ""hey, people will probably pay big money for classic Sonic games even if we put zero effort in!"", and released this ♥♥♥♥.

Zero disrespect for Headcannon, by the way. Their work on Sonic 1, 2, Mania, and this 3&K port had a lot of love put into them - there's plenty of tiny fixes and details peppered into this port that weren't in the original. God bless you, Headcannon, and ♥♥♥♥ you, Sega.

Go get a Sonic CD key online or something to play the superior PC port of that game, and go play Sonic 1 Forever, Sonic 2 Absolute, and Sonic 3 A.I.R. for the good PC versions of those. Don't let Sega scam you out of your money for this. I won't be coming back to Origins unless it gets major patches, whether official or unofficial, and major community mods to boot.

What a cluster♥♥♥♥."

Have you ever heard of a game where the developer had to save its integrity on Twitter and call out the publisher for how rushed, unfinished and buggy the final build of the game is? No? Well, then you're in for a ride.
After Sonic 06, Sonic Boom Rise of Lyric, Sonic Forces and Sonic Colors Ultimate, SEGA released another game riddled with bugs and low quality. SEGA rushed this game and didn't want to delay it, because they thought it might be neat to release it on the same day Sonic 1 released, which is a nice homage, but they still don't get that a rushed product is a problem for the devs and the actual buyers. It is like using washing powder for your cake each time, wondering why it tastes bad.

Now, before I get into it, I will mention the actual positive side.

This game is great in terms of presentation. It is so nice to have the actual islands Sonic ventures on be visualized. They make the Sonic world seem way more connected. Furthermore, the cutscenes are still wonderfully animated. They clearly love the Toei Sonic style, and I wouldn't have it in any other way. While most of the cutscenes shown are only for the opening, others are for the start and ending of the games, which leads into a connected story.
The mission mode is also pretty fun. I haven't played all missions yet, but it seems like each mission has its own stage, reminding me of Sonic Generations, and what can I say, they do their job in delivering some extra challenge.
The last good thing is that you can retry special stages if you fail. Back then it was quite frustrating, but this way it actually is fun to hunt the Chaos Emeralds/Time Stones.

Now, let's slowly dip our toes into the depths.

The Sonic CD cutscenes weren't re-animated. I think it would be a nice novelty to keep the original cutscenes in the museum, unfortunately the game uses the old 4:3 cutscenes for the story itself too. That is quite inconsistent and makes it seem like a fan mod.

Next is the drop dash, while it's nice to have the drop dash, I just cannot fathom how bad it is in this game. The drop dash in Sonic Origins is more of an instant spin dash rather than the actual drop dash from Mania. Meaning, you lack air control, you cannot redirect Sonic. That is quite frustrating to use. It is nice to have it, but the way they implemented it makes him feel like a car.

Now.....the bugs. I would've hoped not to encounter bugs, since I rarely do, but in this game I actually got the most annoying and frustrating bugs possible. If Tails in Sonic 2 is flying whilst you jump into the Special Stage, you'd be able to hear his flying sounds the entire stage's time. Even worse was the fact that I beat Sonic 2's final boss, and when the end screen appeared, I started to realize I was softlocked. I couldn't continue in any way. I was stuck, waited 2 minutes and then just gave up, restarted the game and had to beat the final boss A G A I N.
Next is Sonic 3. Sonic 3 is a mess. Next to Sonic changing into the foreground layer, even though during the cutscene he should've been in the background, he also clipped through multiple objects, through layers of the stages, leaving me softlocked a good few times, but they also completely messed with his physics. Sonic in this game is way too fast. He bonks his head against walls he never was intended to hit, ruining the flow of the stage. He also isn't able to reach the heights he used to. I wasn't able to reach, for example, a Special Stage because they messed with Sonic's jump, leading to him not gaining enough height.

The DLC for Sonic Origins is such a cash grab. Remember when they tried to monetize Super Sonic in Forces? They literally just put a few missions in here, add an island camera view which should be in the base game, and rip the old models from Generations/Forces, put them in here, stiffly animating them. These extra 5 bucks should've been in the package, even the price is question worthy. Sonic Mania released for half of that and was more of a new game than this is. Hell, I'd even say it makes more sense to buy Sonic Mania and Sonic Generations instead, since you get the best out of both worlds with both being half original/half remake-type games.

Also, where is the time attack mode? I mean....for a Sonic game there should be a time attack mode, where you can actually pick the stages and speedrun them individually, just like in Mania.

Last, but not least, is a direct question. Where is the new character? You featured Amy so prominently in literally each promotional material, even the ending clearly hints at Amy maybe being playable, but she isn't. It feels like the devs really wanted to make her playable, but realized there wasn't enough time.

Sonic Origins might be the 22nd way to play Sonic 2, but it is far from the best. SEGA should learn to stop using Sonic like a GTA free money glitch, 5/10."

I made the mistake of pre-purchasing this before it was released. Usually I wouldn't do such a thing but I thought ""its the Christian Whitehead/Stealth Android ports finally brought to the PC, this'll be great"". Simply put, I didn't think there was a way to screw this up. Sadly it turns out although it uses some Headcannon content, these ports are mostly made by Sonic Team who haven't got a clue. These ports are full of bugs I've never seen in my 25+ years of playing these games. Last time I played I saw two completely new bugs in Angel Island Act 1 alone.

The UI is also wildly inconsistent, Sonic CD's menu from its previous port is still lurking in there despite the other games having nothing similar.

""Story mode"" is a fun concept but really doesn't add anything different to just playing the games sequentially. In fact if you treat the 4 games as a continuous campaign then the difficultly curve is frankly god awful. By my count there are 34 zones to play through if you want to beat ""story mode"". Of these 34 levels arguably the most difficult, Labyrinth Zone, is the 4th you'll play. I'm not critiquing the games for not working with the story mode format, its not why they were made, I just think that if this is Baby Timmy's first experience playing the classic Sonic games then Story Mode is going to be a bad time.

These games aren't *unplayable* and only the most hardcore of Sonic nerds will notice the discrepancies but the real tipping point is that the collection is comically overpriced. I tried to argue a justification for having pre-ordered Sonic Origins but frankly I feel stupid. Don't make the same mistake I did. Go get one of the fan made ports. Sonic 3 AIR even has a native Linux port and works great on the Steam Deck."
sonic+origins,Not Recommended,22.5,"Posted: June 24, 2022
Sigh...After Mania was such a smash hit, I was hoping for Origins to be an utter slam dunk as well. I had a lot of hype going into this. The CW versions of Sonic 1 and 2 on PC, finally. Sonic 3 getting the same treatment FINALLY after Whitehead was denied doing so a decade ago, fancy new intro/outro animations for every single game to provide context for each game's story and a bunch of neat little extras, such as concept art, animatics, extra songs, etc.

All of that sounded great, even if I think the price for it is way, way too steep for games that are nearing 3 decades in age. But where does it crumble apart? Behind the scenes is where it crumbles apart.

Playing any game in Origins, you can immediately tell corners were cut. The physics, while remarkably close to the original games, still feel slightly off. For example, in Sonic 3's Launch Base Zone, you can't enter the pods if you're standing right next to them because your jump is just ever slightly too high. In Sonic 2, the Aquatic Ruin boss fight becomes weirdly difficult due to the aspect ratio, making it feel more like an oversight. In Sonic 1's Green Hill Zone boss fight, you can effectively cheese the boss by standing under the platforms (which wasn't possible in the original, you still had to dodge).

The one thing that gets me though, is the music. Yes, I'm partially talking about the songs in Sonic 3, but I just mean the quality of the songs overall. Again, launching any game aside from CD, you can just hear the compression and crunch of every song. The quality of the songs is astoundingly low quality. It feels like they're using heavily compressed 128 kbps YouTube rips for every single song, and that's genuinely a shame. You don't need to be an audiophile either to hear the low quality, you can just immediately notice it as soon as it transitions from the Origins menu to the game.

And of course, Sonic 3's changed music. Contrary to what others may think, I don't hate the replaced tracks. And if you don't know - they replaced the songs with compositions from Sonic 3's November 1993 prototype. Except, for some reason, they based the songs off of the MIDI compositions from the S&K collection on 1997. Zones like Ice Cap and Launch Base sound fine, if anything I think they genuinely recomposed the 1993 proto. ver of Ice Cap and cleaned it up, and it sounds legitimately wonderful, but Carnival Night Zone...god, it sounds awful.

And then Sonic 3's Super Sonic theme they added. It's...awful. It sounds like something ripped out of Sonic 4. The baffling bit? They included the Unused Theme in the game's Museum Mode for Sonic 3's soundtrack. Why...couldn't they just...use that? It's just baffling. They can include it in the collection but apparently not use it in the game?

I don't wanna keep going. Sonic Origins is a disappointment. I pre-ordered the Digital Deluxe edition by selling my CS:GO knife to buy it, and honestly - I kinda want my knife back now. The animation work done here is incredible and the extras they gave in the game are nice, but none of it makes up for what feels like shoddy ports of mobile games, poor audio quality and just overall lack of polish.

I read some behind the scenes stuff on Origins' development, including and it just saddens me how Sega continues to mistreat its developers and its beloved properties.

sonic+origins,Not Recommended,18.9,"Posted: June 23, 2022
An absolutely disgraceful collection but I did not expect anything more since it was made ""internally at SEGA""

CONS:

Most important - NO integer scaling, meaning all 4 games look just as blurry as Sonic CD 2011. What was the point of finally releasing the 2013 remasters on consoles if they look worse than when they did on mobile?

Mission Mode is comprised of bite-sized, generically-designed levels that would make the most amateur platformers blush. I could tell it was made by Sonic Team cuz the mode features grey X-blocks like Forces and they're EVERYWHERE with no slopes in sight

Knuckles isn't playable in CD (a primarily exploration-based game). Don't get me started on Amy - a character that's been promoted since the Archie Mega Drive days as part of Team Sonic. Then in Mania Adventures, then in IDW comics, and now here. So you'd think they would finally make her playable? Lol, you want them to make a NEW sprite-sheet (which they did back in CD 2011 for Tails)? You're asking for too much

No customizations. After all these years, after fan projects like S1 Forever, S2 Absolute, S3 Complete, S3 A.I.R., OR EVEN Sonic Mania, our boys at SEGA couldn't be bothered to add the most BASIC options between all 4 games like fans do. No peel-out in S3, elemental shields in S1/CD/2, max control, Jam difficulties, can't disable the Drop Dash, no option to use lives/timeouts in Anniversary Mode or collect Tokens in Classic Mode, etc.

Island Tour DLC just allows you to zoom-in on each island, not even rotate them. Money well spent. And that ""animated characters on island"" DLC? All of them are ripped from Gens/Forces

Super Sonic isn't in S1. Now you might say ""What are you talking about, obviously he isn't"". Yeah, umm... except some Japanese promo images showed him in Scrap Brain. So I thought ""Oh, so he, alongside a 7th Special Stage are in Anniversary Mode, nice bonus"". And he isn't. You can only access him using cheats, just like on mobile. Is this a nitpick? Yeah, but maybe they shouldn't have blatantly lie to consumers, then

The ""Drop Dash"" is a pure lie. What do I mean? It's actually a disguised Spin Dash animation that happens for a split-second? Doesn't sound bad, except the AGES version of S1/S2 natively added it to their ROMs. Oh! And in Origins it BARELY moves you after you execute it. Best part? S1/S2 have a fixed jump arc, so if you try to do this move in those games and jump, you won't be able to control yourself mid-air (think Castlevania)

The Museum... god, remember those so-called ""never-before seen concept arts"" they promised? Well I'm here to tell you there are like 6 of them, everything else are Harmony covers and character sheets. The Video section has none of those cool 90s ads, promo videos or even documentaries, just a few pieces of the Sonic Symphony they threw in at the last hour, Origins' cutscenes and every episode of Mania Adventures (and their respective animatics). Both Normal and Premium sections offer very little content, especially if you pre-ordered the game which gives you a 100 Token bonus, you can literally unlock everything in under 2 hours. Not to mention it's complete silence, no remix of History or anything like that, no feeling of nostalgia. Just cynical, corporate silence as you browse what little they offer. Only """"new"""" track here is a remix of Sonic World from Jam that plays everywhere except the Museum. Classy

S1/2/CD are straight mobile versions, so they haven't been touched up at all. Meaning the missing rolling SFX in CD hasn't been fixed, and the extended camera is still absent

Horrible audio quality. Believe it or not, they REMOVED the remastered OSTs for S1, CD and S2 from mobile. Why? No clue. As for S3&K, y'know... the only new thing here, it isn't given the same treatment so its OST is really muffled, and ON TOP OF THAT, CD's 2 OSTs are super quiet and also in bad quality. How did they screw it up? idk, but it is hilarious

Your Score in S3&K resets to 0 if you click the Restart button. This doesn't happen in other games

The music DLC (Chaotix, 3D Blast and Spinball) misnamed countless tracks. For example; Chaotix's bad ending theme (Destructive Power) is Door to Summer, while 3D Blast's Invincibility theme is the Menu theme. Incompetent? Very much. Funny? Absolutely

No Chaotix island. You might notice how Origins' gallery features stuff from Chaotix, 3D Blast and Spinball, the OSTs from those games they repackaged as DLC at the last minute, as well as the islands from Spinball and 3D Blast in the hub menu and... wait a second... where's the Island of Miracles from Chaotix? You telling me, the island from a game that is the closest to Sonic's gameplay of that era isn't here... but islands from 2 US-made games, one of which is a pinball spin-off made to promote a show that never aired in Japan, are here? Not only is this sorta insulting, I'm like 1000% sure it was supposed to be here as an Options island, they just didn't make a model of it in time, and plastered Options in the Museum of all places

Screwed up physics. Due to S3&K here clearly being made on Mania's engine, it had a lot of ramifications on the game's internal logic. Some stuff is cool like all elemental shields function how they did in Mania, making the bubble shield fun to use. Others... because the game now controls exactly like Mania, there are a LOT of collision/physics bugs that weren't present in the OG game

CD's ending animation. While the restoration team did really well with remastering the original opening, I... have no idea what happened with the ending. It looks like one of those interpolated anime clips. Worst part? It's sped up by 3x and there are no SFXs in the beginning, so it instantly plays the credits theme. The Gallery also plays it off-sync and it doesn't feature the bad ending version. Actually a joke

Even though I'm not one of those people that plays S3 and S&K separately, it's kinda absurd how they initially advertised this collection with those 2 games in mind. Final release? You can't play them separately. Oh well

The new S3&K tracks. I don't know what sound chip Jun Senoue (same guy who composed S4EI) used but it sure wasn't a Mega Drive one. Tracks sound muffled, quiet and overall don't fit the game. It's especially insulting to CNZ Act 2, its prototype track is EASILY one of my favorite Sonic tunes... and Jun completely butchered it. They should've asked Yuzo Koshiro to recompose them. But you wanna know THE coolest part? Origins is made on Criware, meaning the audio is encrypted, meaning it'll be really hard to mod music in. Just a neat thing, y'know :)

Denuvo. No need to explain, you already know the game runs poorly. Countless stuttering too

PROS:

Cutscenes look great, but what did you expect from Tyson Hesse and Powerhouse, you knew they'd pull it off with flying colors. However they haven't animated any of the bad endings, meaning if you get one in any of the games, it would still play said game's true ending

The restoration group they hired to scan various pieces for the Museum and clean up the CD opening (not the ending) did a really good job

The S3&K remaster, despite the collection's flaws, is alright. Nowhere near the level of AIR, which is odd cuz I know Stealth and his crew can do WAY better than this. At least it wasn't done by SEGA

Classic games on PC, so your usual ""Hope modders will fix it"" mentality will continue yet again! You expect SEGA to do all the work? Pfftt, yeah right

Notice how all the collection's positives I listed were outsourced to 3rd parties and not done by SEGA? That should tell you how much they care. In the end you're left with:

Sonic 1 (the Spin Dash is still present in the so-called Classic mode)
Sonic 2 (with a horrible, downright game-breaking Tails AI)
Sonic CD (they use leftover UI from the mobile version I kid you not)
and Sonic 3&K (with its muffled, MJ-free OST)

I was born playing these games and have such fond memories of them.... but paying £27.99 for them in 2023 is not exactly fair AND removing the other versions from Steam for purchase too so you're FORCED to pay the high price.

You can literally play all these games elsewhere for a lot cheaper, with mods too that fix the issues the games have.

I've also seen that they added a DLC that barely does anything apart from add Amy as a playable character for £8.99 - why not just provide this for free?

SEGA, we love you but please sort it out. Bit more fan service would be nice... drop the price and include your tiny DLCs in the game as updates. In doing so, you'll make many more sales.

No one wants to pay this price for 4 16 bit games from the 90s."

This collection is, frankly, not worth $30.

Sonic 1: Forever
Sonic 2: Absolute
Sonic 3: Angel Island Revisited
Sonic CD's 2013 Decompilation

These are all free, fan-made remasters/ports of the 4 games included in this collection. They all have widescreen, and nearly all of them have support for mods, which would allow you to add in whatever this collection does. I understand that SEGA needs to make money from their games, that's not the point I'm trying to make, what I'm saying is; You're paying $30-40 for something that's WORSE than what you can get for FREE.

SEGA also delisted the old Steam ports of these games, making them completely inaccessible unless you buy codes from some shady website. I love SEGA, I love Sonic, but this is scummy and you should not buy it. NOT. AT. ALL."

Unfortunately they removed some of the original songs and replaced them with beta songs or new songs. You can get the original music back by installing ""thedefinitivesonic3ost"" from game banana.

1. Open the zip file so the two music files, “Music03_3SK.acb” and “Music03_S3K.awb” are visible.
2. Navigate to your steamapps/common directory. Find the SonicOrigins folder.
3. Navigate to image, x64, raw, and then sound.
4. Replace the music files in the folder with the ones you have in the zip.

The other thing I had to fix was latency. The game suffers from a frame or two of delay on button presses. The only way I was able to fix this was by switching the window mode to borderless fullscreen.

With those fixes out of the way, this is an amazing game that adds a new coin system, boss rush, mirrored mode, wide screen support, and you can play as all three original characters in any of the games. I was able to do some of this to a degree in the original games but this game makes it so much easier. Get the super uber big pp deluxe version BUT wait for it to go on sale for $25 or less."

When your fans can make a better port of your older games completely for free and with infinitely more customization, you're doing something wrong. And even then I wouldn't expect as much detail as there is in Sonic 3 AIR, Sonic 2 Absolute, or Sonic 1 Forever from an official port anyways, but when you can't even get the games to not be blurry garbage then you've just failed completely.

Now, before I recommend this game...

A little word of warning, DO NOT get this game if you have no intentions to mod it, it's one of those games that suffer from what I like to call ""Death of a thousand needles"" Imaging Sonic Origins as a body, and each problem it has as a needle. In and of itself each problem is small, from incorrect aspect ratios, graphical inconsistencies, and aspects of each game being incorrect when compared to the original.

Each problem is not huge, it will just leave you thinking...
""Why?""

It's like a needle is used to stab the body, it's small, hurts a bit, but very controllable and treatable.
However, Sonic origins has so many of these problems that it's almost comical!
Hench the term ""Death of a thousand needles"", there are just so many of these problems that plague Sonic Origins that they all add up and completely screw the game. I'm sure getting stabbed by a thousand needles at once has the ability to really mess someone up...

I have go through the long process of setting up the mod launcher and installing the files needed to use the mods, and I am very happy with the result!

I've improved the game so much through mods, that I think Sonic Origins is a great game! (When modified)

Do note that you need to be careful with DLC here, some of the practices are scummy, so read the reviews on them to get and idea of what to expect or how to get around it.

If you have the patience to do all the steps needed to mod the game, then here are some resources I used to get me started!







If you don't have the patience to do this stuff...

Note: Sonic Team is releasing Origins Plus in June as of posting this. The game will be $40 USD, include all the ""DLC"" of Origins, as well as having a bigger expansion with Game Gear titles and a playable Amy and Knuckles in every Genesis game. The game might be worth it to you when that time comes, but as of now, save your money for when it's worth the price, because they will sell you these upgrades in June if you buy this version.I've held off roasting how this game has been handled in hopes that the huge issues with it would be fixed in future updates, however not only is there no word on any more fixes, Sonic Team just announced a Sonic Origins Plus, which will cost an additional $10 for current owners of Sonic Origins. While I would love to play as Classic Amy (and honestly expected her to be an end game unlock for THIS version) and would love the Game Gear titles, for fans of the Genesis games, this collection does a rather poor job at replicating the feeling of the older games. The game ports are for the most part ""satisfactory"", but this is replacing perfectly fine emulations on Steam, which were ALL taken down before this came out (and retailed at a cheaper price for all 4 games). The cutscenes are the best part of this collection, as they're lovely additions to introduce you to the world of Sonic and are very nonobtrusive. However, some issues crop up when you investigate the games themselves. (Some physics issues I believe have been patched but I can't confirm all of them due to how random they seemed in the first place.) When I played, sometimes you'd ramp off of something really fast and slam into a wall a little too hard, crushing you. While this is a very realistic scenario in real life, this does not happen in the classic games. Also, in Sonic CD, Sonic no longer has voice clips. There weren't too many in the first place, but they were cute and added to the charm of the game. The more problematic parts that bothered me the most though was how the audio was handled in S3&K. I have no idea why they did it, but the audio sounds very muffled on every stage. I don't mind the replacement tracks (even though they seem worse quality than the old PC port of the 90's), but the audio is just so poor it makes me never want to play the Origins version of this game again. Don't get me started about how poor all the sprites look. I don't know how they messed up the blurring of pixels, but something just looks so off with it.The worst parts are honestly that this game does not preserve history as it was originally, and it instead tries to overwrite it with poorly implemented ""upgrades"" for the newer generation without considering what makes the original version so timeless. Even the classic modes of the games are just Anniversary modes except modified to ""feel"" more original (no widescreen, lives system, etc, yet still poor pixelation, bad audio, and weird physics issues). The marketing for this game was also awful with the DLC which amounted to a bunch of basic features of a menu being ripped out and sold to you for extra. Maybe when Plus comes out, this game will be worth your money, but until then don't be like me. Wait until the game is worth buying, and even then wait a few days for reviews. Who knows? Maybe they'll release a nice overhaul that fixes many of the issues I pointed out.Edit 2/25/23: It has come to my attention that Sonic Team actually does tend to patch the game again when the Plus edition rolls out in order to fix more bugs and improve the overall quality of the game. This doesn't change my review, but is something to keep notice of when the game gets its update in the future."

So. Sonic Origins. It's a game!

PROS:
- All 4 Genesis games are CLASSICS, and are genuinely worth playing whether you're a seasoned Sonic veteran or a new fan.
- The missions are actually fun, and some of them are quite challenging!
- The animated cutscenes are glorious and beautifully tie the story together.
- Amy! Kind of. She's got her own moveset and everything.
- All 4 games can be played in widescreen and without the hassle that is a lives counter. I really like the coin system- in place of an extra life, you'll earn a coin. These can be spent on bonus items in the Museum.
- With Origins Plus, you get the Game Gear games. These haven't had an official re-release in a while (since the early 2000s), so it's nice to see them here. They're not GREAT but they are a fun little piece of Sonic history that should be preserved.
- They fixed the blurry anti-aliasing... after a year.


CONS:
- Denuvo DRM. It's a very useless ""anti piracy"" software that uses up SO MUCH processing power that the game is unplayable on low end computers. It was removed from Mania after backlash, but clearly they didn't learn their lesson here. I'm not sure why anyone would pirate Sonic Origins specifically, but go off, Sega.
- The Genesis version of Spinball isn't here, for some reason. It seems like it WAS planned, due to the presence of a fully-modeled Spinball area used as the menu screen for missions and story mode, but not the game itself! That's weird.
- Unskippable cutscenes and intro. They're good, but it would be nice to be able to skip them upon replaying a game.
- The audio is screwed up six ways from Sunday. Low quality, incorrectly pitched audio, sped up audio, and that nasty un-MJ-ified Sonic 3 soundtrack. Really. It's not fun to listen to. I had to install a mod to reinsert the original soundtrack.
- Bonus/museum content is lacking. There isn't much there that we haven't seen already, and some info relating to music track titles is straight up wrong.
- The mouse cursor doesn't close when you open the game. That's like, literally the bare minimum.
- Amy does not come with the base game. She comes with Origins PLUS. There's a lot of stuff locked into Plus, which used to be split up into several other DLCs. It's not really worth the extra 10 dollars unless you're a diehard Amy fan. Which I am. Basically, content locked behind a paywall. Boooo.
-Overall, some weird choices were made that makes this compilation feel rushed. A lack of individual save files for some games, weird character select screens, reused menu audio from other games...

I'll still play it because I'm a filthy completionist and a dedicated Sonic fan, but I wouldn't really recommend this collection to fans OR casual players. I would, however, recommend the fan-made remasters (available for PC, Switch and Android), which are free to download but do require Legally Obtained APKs (of the 2010s mobile remasters) or the no-longer-in-circulation Steam roms (for Sonic 3 and Knuckles). Or, y'know, don't legally obtain those roms and APKs. I'm explicitly NOT endorsing piracy, but I also can't stop you. So do what you will.

TLDR: $30 for an unfinished, low-quality compilation isn't worth it, even if it does have Amy."

Games like these are why I wish there was a neutral thumb-up. But I suppose I’m 63% thumbs down.

When this was first announced I was like, ""haha okay yeah sure make me buy the classics again, Sega.""

And then I did.


Some Good things:

>Intros/Outros are absolutely phenomenal and are nice addition next to Sonic CD usually only having the only intro/outro.

>There's new custom sprites in some games. I was overjoyed when Super Sonic sprites weren’t just recolored regular Sonic sprites anymore.

>All games come with drop dash and spin dash (I realize the spin dash isn’t such a big deal as most Sonic hacks have these, but the features are nice.)

>The debug menu is actually fully incorporated and there's no buggy sprites or missing objects/things. Weird controls though.

>The mission mode? FANTASTIC. Probably my favorite thing about this collection. The missions were really creative and they just work perfect with the gameplay of classic sonic. And the hard ones never felt unfair. Tornado Flyby is cancer though. I hardly got frustrated because 95% of the missions is testing your ability and control to accomplish a small task and not relying on a gimmick you just got introduced to.

>Coin system is great for newcomers. They can play the game without having to worry about being sent back to the title screen and you can redo special stages if you happen to spill spaghetti on your hands while Blue Sphere is at max speed. And if you do all the missions and get S ranks you can buy all the things in the museum and still have a ton of coins leftover. It's a really nice reward for sticking your neck out and trying your best on the missions.

>If somehow you didn't have internet to scour the internet for classic sonic music, you could extract them all from this game.

And then there is the obviously bad stuff:

>No Knuckles for Sonic CD. C'mon dude...

>DLC content is so minuscule that it should've just been included. DLC should warrant, ""Playable Mighty/Ray/Amy, completely new original zones as secrets, etc."" Smash puts out a completely new character for $6.

>Sonic Origins music pack is just listening to an extra sound test of games they didn’t bother putting in the Origins collection (Chaotix/3D Blast/Spinball). Kind of a slap in the face when a sound test is a FREE feature in each of these games.

>The fun pack? It’s just little things like some extra music, harder missions, more models on the islands, and new borders for your screen. What does that sound like to you? “Unlockable content through completing certain parts of the collection” is the first thing that comes to mind. But in this day and age, instead it’s “pay for it”. For Christ’s sake...

>Should be waaaaay cheaper. By comparison, Crash N. Sane Trilogy, CTR Nitro-Fueled, and Spyro Reignited are inspired by previous content but *completely rework* the content, while Sonic Origins just straight up uses old content with slight modifications — and all of them are the same price on launch. Mission mode, animations, and everything else new doesn't mean it's the same level of dedication that went into the previously mentioned games.

>Achievements are hilariously easy. The game’s like, ""Congratulations! You opened the game here's an achievement. Oh? You used the level select to go to the final stage and cheated? No problem! Here's another achievement for beating the whole game! Now destroy 10 moto bugs! You can just use debug to spawn them."" It took me only 8.7 hours to get every achievement. And that’s because Sonic CD was the only game you had to play through because it doesn’t have access to debug mode from the start. That’s a good thing though! You have to play the game to unlock the achievement, which is what it should be for each game!

>Removing the MJ tracks and, pfffft, on top of that, replacing the already really good sonic 3 beta music with worse versions was baffling. And I really respect MJ’s music outside of Sonic, so it hurts even more they’d disrespect him like that.

Overall, this was an okay package, but it pales in comparison to Sonic GEMS Collection/Sonic Mega Collection Plus. These games were top-notch and had scanned original instruction manuals to read through, hundreds of comic covers, the sheer number of games AND unlockable games, developmental cut-scene videos — all freely included in the package and the point of extra content was that you, the player, had to work for it.

UPDATE: Well we got Sonic Origins Plus. And SEGA handled in the most typical, money-grubbing way possible.

>Amy is now playable.

Cool.

>Knuckles is in Sonic CD.

Pretty cool.

>All game gear titles were added.

Ahh, taking a page from Sonic GEMS collection and Sonic Mega Collection Plus, I see. Nice.

>Because I was a loyal fan that purchased the original game for $39.99... if I want these features, I need to spend the $10 for the upgrade resulting in a total purchase of $49.99?

WAIT NOT COOL.

So get this - Sonic Origins Plus is $39.99, meaning that people who didn't pay into it previously are getting a better deal. Plus, it includes all the previous DLC, saving you $16 if you only bought Sonic Origins Plus.

Here's a breakdown of price differences:
-------------------------------------------------------------
>Sonic Origins was originally $39.99.

>Premium Fun Pack was $3.99.
>Classic Music Pack was $3.99.

>Sonic Origins is now $29.99. The other packs have been removed from the store page.

>The Plus Upgrade is $9.99.

>Sonic Origins Plus all together is $39.99.
-------------------------------------------------------------
Worse, if you paid $46 to get all the extra features, now you're paying $56. Almost retail price...

Are you kidding me? Because we believed in your product, you're making pay more than people who didn't originally buy it?

Not like it's a ridiculous price increase, but c'mon, it just shows how much they don't care about treating fans with respect."

Sad to say this but, in its current state, I cannot recommend Sonic Origins:

- The keyboard controls are unbelievably bad, I just can't believe it, even after checking its bindings on the options menu, on Sonic 3 at least I CANNOT CONTROL WITH THE ARROWS!

- Graphics aren't great, I wanted the Sonic 3 remake with the good HD Christian Whitehead mobile remakes graphics, but this looks blurry, I wouldn't think this is a remake, but the game resized to widescreen. Sonic 3 AIR looks better.

- Music at least on Sonic 3 is bad, doesn't sound remastered, the volume is low and it doesn't sound nice like the Sonic 3 AIR remastered soundtrack option.

EDIT: I asked for a refund with this note left:

This game isn't what we've been promised: Atrocious keyboard controls, blurry/non-HD remastered graphics and badly remastered music or plainly not remastered.
This kind of basic issues only can happen if this game wasn't made with love, they had to know at least about the terrible keyboard controls, and even if it were easy to fix, they still released it.
And it is clear why: Christian Whitehead didn't work on this, SEGA did."

Completed as of writing this review: All Achivements.

Since the original ROMs for the trilogy were delisted and I have no option to review them, I'll leave my reviews for the originals here:

Sonic The Hedgehog: The first, but not the best. On the good side, we need to thank this game for creating the franchise, but on the other, it's really not what it was advertised to be. So-called Blast Processing was a good marketing technique that made this game stand out. However was it really all about the speed? Sonic may be the fastest thing alive, but not in this game, since only a fraction of the zones is speed-based at best. The special stages were also really challenging and not really rewarding. However, giving this game a shot is also a good suggestion because it's not bad, it's just... not all that fast.

This game is just.. cool. I don't know how else to describe it. It's definitely one of those games that have a love-hate relationship in the fanbase. Some people like it, others hate it. And you can really see why. If we're talking a Good Ending route, it's a really unique game for Sonic's gameplay style. However it's not about the speed, it's more about exploration, which destroys Sonic's momentum. Visually this game is gorgeous with very colorful stages and the best music in the series (I'm talking JP of course).

The game each MegaDrive owner loved. This is one of the best examples of how to make a sequel. It has new zones with a good sense of speed and progression that doesn't make you feel bored. If not the development crunch, probably that would be the best Sonic game in the series. Well, objectively it is one of those, but for my taste, the third one is better.

An absolute gem of a game. Since this game was split into two halves, it really gave the developers more time to create the best Sonic game for the SEGA MegaDrive. Really cool stages with catchy music and also a unique approach to how the story progresses. And yeah, this time this game has a lot more story and character than previous games. Also, new flashed-out art style makes this game just ooze with a cool attitude.

Now for


An another way for SEGA Marketing department to have us in their handcuffs, as they delisted the originals and forced us to buy this half-assed version, while emphasizing on the fact that we begged the remasters to be ported to consoles and PC for almost a decade. The first two MegaDrive games are ported... ok? I don't remember major issues with them. Sonic CD though was a really mixed bag. They decided to upscale the opening and ending, while ruining the ending's original feel that was done the best in the 2011 release. I'm still disappointed as hell at them for removing the satisfying good ending sound that always gave me goosebumps because it was so good. Sonic 3 & Knuckles though? This is the most unfortunate, as the developer of the remaster stated that the engines' clash introduced the new bugs and also there was no time to fix them as this was rushed for anniversary. Also new renditions of so-called ""PC collection"" themes are barely listenable. The menus also are badly optimized because of Hedgehog Engine 2 without the option to do anything besides lowering the resolution. Not to mention the boldness of them to sell the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ animations for menus in real money. Missions are also lackluster in some way. The challenge itself is fine, but the presentation feels unpolished with all those boxes meant to stop the player from getting out of bounds. And the ""classic mode"" is just 4:3 aspect ratio (not correctly centered btw) with lives. No emulation, no original experience. I don't have access to this game anymore as I played through Family Sharing, but I don't miss this game at all. I have bought the originals before that, so I'm fine playing them and only them."
sonic+origins,Not Recommended,50.9,"Posted: October 11, 2022
I'm a HUGE Classic Sonic fan but this collection here is a giant disappointment and I'm gonna give out criticism on why I hate this collection.

My main criticism about this collection is the pricing, 55 CAD is too much for four Classic Sonic games, especially when compared to Sonic Mega Collection which cost 20 dollars with 12 games. Sega even decided to delist the four Classic Sonic games on the digital store when the trailer came out and decided to lock some content behind DLCs such as extra missions and some island additions, That is very disgusting since it's a collection of four 30-year-old games.

You even can't play as Metal Sonic or Amy Rose despite them being featured in the collection and can't even play as Knuckles in Sonic CD which is just very absurd and a big missed opportunity. Speaking of missed opportunities, It even sucks that Sonic 3D Blast, Sonic Spinball, and Knuckles' Chaotix aren't even in the collection despite them being available as soundtracks by DLC (Classic Music Pack).

Sonic 3 and Knuckles is by far the biggest offender here in this collection, asides the glitches and bugs, one of the things about this version that made me upset is the fact there aren't any MJ tracks in this version especially Ice Cap as it's replaced by the earlier music from the beta version of Sonic 3, don't get me wrong for two things, The Sonic 3 Prototype music is very catchy and Jun Senoue is a great composer for the Sonic games, The Prototype music in here sounds awful, especially Carnival Night, therefore, wasting Jun's talents in remixing those beta tracks which is just very sad. It still didn't make sense to remix when they could just port the music from the Prototype version. I pretty much doubt if one of the updates will bring back MJ tracks and I'm not exactly sure why they can't get the MJ music to this version, probably it's the licensing issue. That music changed especially Ice Cap sure did give fans hard times.

While Super and Hyper Sonic finally got their own theme in Sonic 3K instead of using repetitive invincibly music but literally sounds like Sonic 4 music which doesn't feel right for Sonic 3K because of its instruments and it's a shame that it's not using the Unused version (But yet the Unused version music was used in the New Blue Spheres results).

Going to Sonic CD in this verison:
Remember how the 2011 port of Sonic CD, the music of it uses the unused loops in the Japanese OST but for unknown reasons, they decided to use the music based on the original version of Sonic CD in the Origins version which I also noticed on Day one when the collection was out. The US OST loops weirdly as it's also based on the original version of Sonic CD as well.

Going back to Sonic 3 in this collection
As we got the music out of the way, I even ended up getting those issues in S3K EVEN WITH PATCHES. I ended up getting soft-locked multiple times, the first time I got soft-locked in Carnival Night by a barrel (or should I say Barrel of Doom), and the second time I got soft-locked in the Knuckles Battle in Hidden Palace after defeating him. There have been many glitches in this version especially at Launch.

There are still some things wrong with this collection,

Classic Mode - Adding Classic mode in this collection sounds like a perfect idea on paper but it's executed poorly as it's just the remastered versions at a 4:3 ratio, Sonic 1 still has the spindash while the original Sonic 1 didn't have a spindash, Sonic 2 in Mystic Caves still takes you to Hidden Palace when falling in the infamous pit, and Sonic 3 still have Sonic and Tails fight Big arms while in the original S3K you don't unless if you play as Knuckles. Couldn't they just have it emulated using the original Sonic versions when using Classic mode

Anniversary Mode - Nothing to say much about it but there is another missed opportunity for an option where you can turn on lives.
The games (Except for Sonic 3K) don't even have save slots, instead, when about to play the game, a character select will just pop up, even the Mobile ports of Sonic 1 and 2 have file selects. Same thing with the Sonic CD 2011 remake where it even has file selection and options but in Origins, you can only change settings in the title screen (I even noticed it resembles the original Sonic CD selection in Origins)

Sonic CD in Origins has voice clips removed, removing ""I'm Outta here"" and""Yes"" voice clips, Classic Sonic being muted is pretty stupid. (If you are wondering, Classic Sonic has gone voiceless since Sonic Generations)


In General, This collection is just worthless with big letdowns,
This collection is not a definitive way to play classic Sonic games, if you want a better remaster of those Classic Sonic games, I recommend Sonic 1 Forever, Sonic 2 Absolute, Sonic CD 2011, and Sonic 3 AIR. Those remasters are way surpeior

I gotta admit that I really love the little animation cutscenes here, and it feels so nice to finally see Sonic 3 and Knuckles getting a rerelease officially although I'm better off with those fan remasters like Sonic 3 AIR and the original version of the classic Sonic games

I would rate this collection a 2/10. I recommend not buying Sonic Origins. It's not really worth it.

If there's anything I'm forgetting, let me know."

Incredibly disappointed. Doesn't run properly, deliberately suppresses player modding and accessibility, lacks a bunch of basic features and extra content. It stutters more than me when I ramble about the lore of LOTR. I can excuse the music replacements because of copyright issues, but no playable Metal Sonic or Amy after all that marketing? No Knuckles in Sonic CD?

Not gonna lie, animated cutscenes were lit.

Also, why does my time not advance on Steam whenever I'm in-game????

SEGA, you never fail to frustrate me.

everyone loves the sonic classics, their masterpiece status is not to be disputed. but as usual with any recent sega product the modding community has to pick up the slack.

once you install some mods to fix almost all of sega's shortcomings, especially the
irredeemable sins committed against s3k's music, this becomes a decent experience.

even still, it's just not worth the price. i feel bad for the animators and the headcanon team whose amazing work was all for a half-baked letdown like this."

Sonic Origins is the result of Sega milking nostalgia, the success of the Sonic Movie and my childhood at it's finest.

Sonic Origins is one of those few cases where I wish an option between positive and negative would be a thing for Steam reviews, however the negative backlash and certain tweets from developers explaining their situation on the game being a rushed job, as well as playing it for a few days now, put me into a mood where I just had to write down my complains and worries in a small review.

I've been dying to play the Christian Whitehead's Retro Engine remasters in an official way on PC for almost a decade now and while the new animated cutscenes add more flavor to each individual game got me crying inside, as well as new QoL improvements being something that people new to the series will appreciate, the core gameplay shows some rough edges such as:
Tails AI not respawning in Sonic 1 and 2.
Collission issues throughout all games, especially Sonic 3. Sonic CD having the least issues.
Sonic 1 and 2 having a jump roll lock, making the games harder than they should be.
Sega apparently not caring or didn't bother getting the licensing for the original 1994 Sonic3 OST.
Sonic 3's physics being totally different compared to the other remasters and original genesis game.
Sonic CD lacks Knuckles as playable character.
Sonic CD missing some sound effects compared to the 2011 rerelease.
You can't replay a completed save, if you wanted to go back and collect all the Emeralds in 1, CD or 2.
Audio mixing is all over the place.
Denuvo DRM will force the user to have an online connection to play the game once in a while, despite it being singleplayer.
And much more.

It's more so concerning that they delisted the original genesis games on Steam and on other console platforms, forcing people to buy Origins. While all these games play good, they are far from perfect and sadly I don't think it's worth the $40 price tag at the moment. Again by no means is Origins a bad game but it's lacking polish.

For now I recommend playing the fan decomps for Sonic 1 and 2 and wait for a sale. You might also want to play Origins with mods to enhance the experience and fix some of the issues that came with the game by default. It's still unclear if Sega is gonna support the game in the long run, fix leftovers or will just run away with everyones money.

As much as I love Sonic, this is overpriced. $40 is way too much for these games, not because they're bad, but because there are so many different, easier, cheaper ways to play them nowadays with tons of extra features and customizability, and Origins simply doesn't have that. If you're planning on getting Origins, I think you should save that money and try out something else."

Okay, so I'm gonna break down what this game entails here...

Pros:
-Sonic 1, 2, 3, and CD in a single package
-Anniversary Mode with Infinite lives and the ability to play as Sonic, Tails, or Knuckles in ALL the games (Edit: Knuckles not available in CD)
-Spin dash and Sonic Mania's Drop Dash available in all games via Anniversary Mode
-Ability to choose between Classic and Anniversary modes
-Additional mission mode and coin system
-New animated cutscenes to watch in Anniversary Mode

Cons:
-Older versions of these games that had mod support have been removed from Steam in order to release Origins
-90% of all new features were previously available as mods for the aforementioned old versions
-Denuvo Anti-tamper may hinder performance (I did not experience this) and may prevent you from playing in Offline Mode

It's fine, but if you have all the older versions, you will probably want to avoid this."

Blame SEGA, not the developers.

Playing the remasters these same people released on IOS and playing mania, I know they can make excellent quality remasters and original games. This game is just such a let down though. The most noticeable thing to me is the image just looks blurred and not sharp like they are in their IOS remasters (yes I went and changed my settings to try and fix it). And the bugs and glitches are prevalent and it's bad enough to say you shouldn't buy it, not unless they fix it, get the IOS releases for 1,2, and CD, and just emulate 3 with A.I.R., it's got way more customization anyways and you'd save yourself a good amount of money.

Real shame the developers weren't given proper conditions to work with and weren't allowed to fix many things they knew were wrong, this could've been the best thing SEGA's released since mania if they just let them work on it until it was done. Don't waste your time or money when you have better options out there for much cheaper."

preface: this game has denuvo.

listen to the negative reviews before you buy, do not take my recommendation blindly; there's a good reason this is mixed. i simply feel that it was worth buying for me personally, despite its issues.

i bought the plus version at full price, but many recommend to wait for a sale. if you are willing, do that instead, as while i feel origins plus is worth it, it is still a high price. if you are content without amy, and knuckles in sonic cd (baffling that this is paid!), you can save $10.

if you're wondering which version of the game to get, get this version. you can mod this game's assets despite denuvo. as of 11/8/23, it has been fixed!"

I have a ethical responsibility to write a negative review for this compilation. the games look nice in widescreen and it's great to be able to see these on a marketplace. I like being able to waddle over to my computer after a long and exhausting day at work and just hit thoughtlessly hit the ""play"" button on this and play some old sonic games.

The problem is, unless you're absurdly affluent and like throwing money away for no reason, there's no reason to purchase this. As a computer owner there are already ways to play these games in 16:9 on PC for a lot less than 40-45 dollars, and they have less bugs and have way more customization options than this offers. I don't need to tell you this since you've probably already read a bunch of reviews but go check out the decompiled ios/android ports of sonic 1, 2, and CD, and of course, check out either sonic 3 complete or sonic 3 AIR for a far superior experience than what this offers.

So basically what you're spending money on here is the compilation goodies and the fact that this natively launches from the steam platform and you can collect achievements for it. The crappy part here is that the achievements are baby stuff. I felt pretty great about having all six chaos emeralds by the end of Spring Yard Zone in Sonic 1, but the game didn't give me any sort of pat on the back or reward for doing so. In fact, the inability to toggle infinite lives off in anniversary mode doubly makes it feel like there's zero incentive for playing these games at a higher level or trying to learn more about them. That sucks!

The extras in the museum are sorely lacking. I remember Sonic Jam on the Saturn way back in 1997 having the original commercials for the games from japan and neat stuff like that. The museum offerings here are presented well and some of the art is in unprecedented resolution which is super cool but it's a lot of what you've seen already! It would've been nice to get some developer commentary tracks on levels, or maybe some options to configure custom playlists to enjoy while playing these video games. Yknow, some sort of offering that you can get here and not in other, superior versions of these widescreen ports.

I don't need to mention the music, we all know its terrible, but I should mention that there is a mod to restore the original soundtrack already. I don't know if there was any way around this. Michael Jackson's estate is notoriously difficult to work with and probably wanted sega to pay out the ass for a game that came out like thirty years ago. I don't really blame them for not wanting to pony up the money. What I can blame them for is how awful the replacement music sounds. Custom playlists or new compositions from guest composers like Tee Lopes or something could have cool but instead we have Jun Senoue offering the worst-sounding ""genesis"" remixes of those godawful prototype tracks i've hated for decades. The situation sucks, but it certainly could've been handled in more thoughtful and creative ways. I also think it's cowardly of them to have done their best to hide the soundtrack replacement news until shortly before launch.

Ultimately, don't buy this game. I bought it because I'm a stupid idiot and I like buying stuff because it makes me feel better about my dumb life. Go donate 40 dollars to an abortion fund or something and just google ""sonic 1 widescreen android pc port"" or something like that. Sonic is an anti-fascist and that's more in line with what he would want you to do, if he was real. I don't think he is though. (God I wish he was)."
sonic+origins,Not Recommended,8.3,"Posted: July 15, 2022
$45 or $40 is way too much for this. Way too much. Sonic 3 AIR, the Original Sonic CD Christian Whitehead port and the unnofficial Sonic 1 and Sonic 2 Android/IOS Reverse Engineered ports all have more content than Origins. And that's without them combined. Ironic because the Christian Whitehead Sonic CD is part of the new collection. Many glitches, and developmental oversight along with shady decisions such as de-listing the genesis classic collections copies of Sonic 1 2 3 & Knuckles alongside the Original Christian Whitehead Sonic CD PC port make this a major Yikes from an ethical perspective.

And forcing me to install a rootkit to run this game is basically a deal breaker. If I wasn't on Linux, I wouldn't have even bothered installing it.

This collection also completely lacks the original genesis versions of these games, which makes sense I guess for Sonic 3&K but not 1 2 or maybe CD.

Maybe Sega wouldn't be in debt and financial issues if you let the devs make good games. It's been almost 20 years since Sonic 06, and yet Sega still manages to mess up Sonic. It's not like they didn't have time either. Sonic CD, 1 & 2 (Christian Whitehead) all came out at 2013 at the latest. That's 9 years. 9 Years to port 1 & 2 to PC and develop Sonic 3&K like the 1 & 2. 9 years. The ports could've been handled by an outside party during that time while Christian Whitehead worked on Sonic 3&K.

This is Sonic 1 GBA all over again."

And by the way, this is not the developers fault, its all sega's fault.

Im only going to give a good rating to this game when the price drops and they fix it.

Edit: Okay for the people that are not aware of what´s going on, the game have a lot of bugs that are not present in the originals, and bad optimization for a lot of pc´s.

But this game has a lot of bugs on pc, specifically with Sonic 3. Marble Garden had debris falling the whole time, I saw multiple graphical glitches in other areas, and there are just better ways to play these games right now if fans know where to go.

If Stealth and his team at Headcannon are allowed to come back to patch some of these issues, and suggest fixes across all of Sonic Origins, I will reconsider and purchase this game again. But for now, I've refunded it. I'm really sad to have had to do that."

I feel like a lot of people really don't seem to understand just what Sonic Origins is....
It always felt to me as if it wasn't really intended to be this massive collection of Sonic games like Mega Collection Plus or Gems Collection was. It was never meant to be anything beyond: ""Hey, we're bringing the HD Remasters of Sonic 1 and 2 to PC, and here's CD and the never before seen an ACTUAL re-release Sonic 3 & Knuckles, all in glorious widescreen. Remade from the ground up in Sonic Mania's retro engine."" Just giving us a nice refreshing take of 4 classic Sonic games packed with some neat things from Sonic's history that should surely reflect it's title as Sonic Origins.

This should have been the explanation right? Well not quite. It seems like the higher ups at Sega didn't exactly know themselves how to market this game. As a result it is unclear to us the consumers, casual gamers and Sonic fans alike what this game really is. Couple that with the absolutely terrible price guide and ""DLC"" additions (which were all later included in the PLUS DLC) and it's very easy to understand why this title's reception is mixed. That being said, what is Sonic Origins. Is it a smash pack of classic Genesis games like the many collections we've seen for decades? Or not.

This is a debate that I'm very tired of seeing because all of the people who know are overshadowed by the loud vocal majority that wants Knuckles Chaotix or Sonic 3D Blast to be included in this pack of remastered Sonic games. (I can understand why, Chaotix hasn't had a release at all and is probably the only 32X title worth playing in my humbled opinion.) If Sonic Origins seemed lackluster already, adding these games will honestly make things even worse. ""Why is Sonic 1, 2, 3 and CD only in HD, why can't we get other genesis games in HD!?"" Sure, if they had competent emulation developers who are able to reverse engineer the code on these old games and then modernize it for today's standards then SURE, games like Sonic 3D Blast or Chaotix would be a no brainer. However it just simply doesn't work like that. As stated previously the titles included in Origins were remade from the ground up. This is not your average Sega Genesis collection and should have been marketed as such!!

Don't even get me started on the quality of the remastered games that we got... It just screams corporate meddling. Every game is full of it's own unique flaws and things that we haven't seen in other Retro Engine remakes. Which is another reason why Sonic Origins has a mixed reception but I want to talk about the elephant in the room. The PLUS DLC.

I applaud them for listening to that loud majority that wanted more content for this game. I feel like it's especially beneficial to the game's reputation as a whole especially given it's strange launch price, this makes people feel as if they're getting their money's worth. Is what I would say if there wasn't another big elephant in the room, THE DIGITAL DELUXE EDITION. (Which I myself pre-ordered when it was available for purchase.) Do you know what we get in the Digital Deluxe Edition?

More coins? - Yes.
Music unlocked from the start? - Yes
More Content to unlock in the Art Gallery? - Yes
Plus DLC? - Ye- No. No?

NO!? The game was a whole $15 extra dollars at launch for people who purchased the Digital Deluxe Edition why are those people not being compensated!? We paid $45 DOLLARS FOR THIS GAME. Okay so you give the people what they want, more content but at the same time you're ripping off the people who pre-ordered the Digital Deluxe Edition!? $55 DOLLARS TOTAL!?For a game that's being listed for $29,99!? Come on now.

Originally I was content with whatever they offered for this game because I was just happy to see those retro engine ports of Sonic 1 and 2 being playable on more than just mobile phones. I was happy because Sonic 3 and Knuckles was FINALLY getting that treatment as well as being the only title to at this point has NOT seen a re-release since Sonic Mega Collection. If I had known that there was a possibility of this game getting a PLUS update and that THIS kind of strategy would be pulled I would have never pre-ordered it because ALL OF THE PRE-ORDER CONTENT COMES IN THE PLUS DLC!

Sega, Sonic Team and their marketing team really dropped the ball on what would have been a decent collection of remastered Sonic games. Is Origins bad? No, not at all. I can tell there was some love put in to all this. While uncredited, part of Mania's dev team helped Sonic Team learn the Retro Engine. But with Orgins and it's troubled backstory, abhorrent marketing and business strategies makes this game just plain bad. Do not buy this title at a high price, wait for it to go on sale. Steam always has really good Sonic The Hedgehog sales and chances are you might even get a game bundled in if you don't have it already.

Till then I'll be laying low til the price inevitably drops and I can purchase the plus DLC. (Too bad it's 1 year TOO LATE for me to get a refund.) I'll be playing the BETTER Sonic title that released last year, Sonic Frontiers which GAVE US FREE DLC ON THE SAME DAY THAT IMPROVED THE GAME IN WAYS ORIGINS COULD EVER DREAM OF. Do yourself a favor, wait for a sale. This collection can wait.

So for now, this game's recommendation is a no from me."

Pre-Plus review:
Sonic Origins needs to be reviewed from the perspective of the devs who worked on the games in the background, namely the Headcannon team, such as Whitehead and Stealth, because seeing Sonic 3 and Knuckles playable with the framework of the iOS/mobile ports of Sonic 1, CD and 2 is something they have wanted for a LONG time. The music change and legalities regarding the soundtrack have understandably prevented this from being a reality, and given official ports have used the new music before, I'm totally fine with the change.

So from the stance that this was a LEGAL NIGHTMARE, I cannot offer anything less than respect for the transparency and determination for the devs pushing for this port to even exist. While the menus, extras, and bonus features are products of SEGA internal, the amount of fan service, classic acknowledgement in the 3D Blast and Spinball islands, and even 1st month patches to fix music labelling errors in the music player, give me great hopes for the longevity of this collection as the ideal way to enjoy these games.

Yes, there is a level of conflict in the community by those who feel the individual games or ports should not have been delisted for this collection, but the goal of this collection is not to eliminate game preservation but rather promote accessibility across the board, and offer these games in their technically most optimised state. And at the end of the day, if people are turned off from this collection because of the Sonic 3 soundtrack changes, the modding community is so vast that the number of free alternatives negate 90% of all critiques.


Post-Plus review? Well, Amy is now in all four games, Knuckles was added to CD, and they're both present on the islands too. If I can discuss my thoughts on the GG additions and whether their consistency with previous collections still holds up in 2023 - they do.

While accessibility is a monumental importance, I don't think the MasterSystem versions offer technical and gameplay advantages, and genuinely cannot understand people wanted OLDER builds of 8/12 8-bit titles as only some games had SMS versions.

But I highly recommend you #PlayTripleTrouble16bit by Noah Copeland if you want HC quality for that game too."

Sure the anniversary mode looks pretty with widescreen but it's not the original and how it was intended.

The 3 stages with the Michael Jackson music removed are horrible to listen to, both in wanting the nostalgia and the replaced tracks are just bad.

There is no challenge to this game, anniversary is way too easy. Yes you can play the classic versions but there are no achievements specific to the classic versions.

Then of course the shady business practice where they remove the true original Sonics from the genesis collection to promote this and even send paid shills to the forums to defend that decision with laughable arguments.

If you want to play the original Sonic games, intact and with real challenge, Retroachievements is where you want to go."

this may be the most accessible way to play these games from an official source as SEGA unfortunately chose to delist the legacy ports and sonic CD to bolster sales but it's not the best way to play these golden age titles

ports suffer from a lack of polish, removed features and have a variety of bugs that made the experience miserable and only made me appreciate the fan remakes which treat the legacy of these games with respect and aim to make playing countless regurgitated titles feel fresh and modernised, fortunately i had purchased this for a reasonably low price during a sale but had i been a day one customer, seeing an upgraded edition of this game set to release a year later with actual features the fans demanded from the beginning and new content that was expected from the get-go would have me feeling robbed and overall comes across as dishonesty from SEGA's perspective, which summarises this whole collection and its advertising to begin with.

Update: New review for version 2.1

Main Game: I am more positive about the game now due to the new DLC and the patches fixing many of the main issues, so overall I will give the game a B rating. I think it could use a DLC pack for Sonic 3/K music (ideally both Sonic 3 and & Knuckles as two types of OSTs) as well as another general patch. The game was price reduced so that helps.

Some general issues are many features like extra characters, emeralds, and new items being hidden in cheat code menus, as well as no ability to replay the games from stage select like Sonic 3/K for the other games even though I know the mobile versions allowed for that. The final special stage in Sonic 1 if you use 7 emeralds is new and very bad so I think it needs to be redone. The lack of many CRT/etc filters is also strange as Mania had this prior.

Classic mode should also allow you to select widescreen optionally to play with lives instead of coins.

Sonic 1: Physics are way off in the special stages. Sonic shoots around so rapidly. It is much harder than it used to be. At least coins exist to let you retry, however. Tails also has some jumping glitches and seems to freeze the game in Labyrinth Zone Act 1.

Sonic CD: Here we mainly have cutscene issues. Why is the volume different in every part of the game? It is very strange. Also the ending has the towers falling over yet no sound effects for them? They used to have sounds. Sonic and Amy cannot talk anymore either. All unappealing changes.

(Tip: Before playing story mode, you can go to the regular game, skip the cutscene intro, then set the game's music to JPN for the other soundtrack. It will play that version of the OST in story mode then.)

Sonic 2: Probably the best game here, nothing really bad about it anymore overall.

Sonic 3/K: The sound is totally off and low quality. I own a Genesis/Mega Drive and played it right next to it to confirm the music is messed up (all tracks). They are too muffled and scratchy. There is a better Sonic 3 beta OST out there. Just check around. They should use that version if they need the original songs. The Super Sonic music is just awful and should be replaced with the regular invincibility song.

Game Gear Games: These are fine if you play a portable version of the game. The best games are Sonic 1, Triple Trouble, and Drift 2. I think every game has some sort of appealing aspect if you give them a chance, at least."

Sonic Origins delivers the meaning of the phrase ""hit or miss.""

Sonic 1 & 2 use the formula from Sonic Mania with a drop dash attack. Well OK.

I am happy about Sonic CD with the Japanese OST by retaining the vocal song You Can Do Anything (Toot Toot Sonic Warrior) unlike the 2011 release for the Steam, PC, Xbox360, and PS3 replaces the instrumental version instead.

As for Sonic 3 and Knuckles, I hate the original music from Carnival Night, Ice Cap, and Launch Base which is based on Sonic & Knuckles Collection for PC in 1997 by avoiding the music composed by Micheal Jackson.

Unlike any compilation, there are no save states, rewind, and Pixel perfect option for each game. If failing any Special Stages of each game, you can retry by using 1 coin that you earn from Anniversary Mode, completing Mission Mode, and Boss mode if your are a newbie expert to Genesis Sonic games.

Not a fan of the Sonic 3 and Knuckles OST came from Sonic Origins? I have a solution for this mod. Please follow this:

If you're really looking for an excuse to play through the classic Sonic games again, Origins does scratch that itch, but it's not without some issues that may hamper the experience.

The physics and game logic have a few bugs that weren't in the originals. For one, Tails doesn't despawn/respawn properly in Sonic 2, meaning sometimes you can hear him repeatedly jumping offscreen trying to reach you.




That being said, these issues are ultimately minor compared to everything else. The games still play well for the most part, and the 16:9 gameplay of Anniversary Mode is a nice change of pace compared to having played the games in their original forms several times already."

some of my favorite games. lots of love obviously went into this. it's great to have an official release of S3K with widescreen. missions are cool, the new cinematics are nice.

but this release is incredibly disappointing ESPECIALLY for the price. there are many massive oversights and bugs in here for what should be the definitive way to play these games - I've been looking forward to a PC release for the rest of the HC ports for years. I was more than willing to pay for that alone, acknowledging this release is much stingier on content than prior. Sonic Mega Collection and Sonic Gems was a steal.

also it's just abysmal that after all of that anyone thought it was a good idea to add Denuvo. The games are millennials and the cinematics are going to be on YouTube if they aren't already, they don't need consumer unfriendly protection. These games obviously have sold enough over the years without Denuvo.

Please fix this release. Sonic and its fans paying their hard earned dollarydoos deserve better.

edit:
looks like the plus pack is, at a minimum, adding the playable characters that were HEAVILY implied already... for $10!!! I hope that physics and sound issues I recall are also being fixed, ideally for both people with and without the new content."

Faithful remasters.

Pros:
+ Easy 100% achievements.
+ New additional Missions, test your skill.
+ New widescreen format that removes lives.
+ As far as the games go, they'll play exactly as you remember playing them as a child, solid.


- Denuvo DRM plagues this game's identity.
- Delisting the standalone games from the store page is scummy.
- The 2 DLCs are great, but they should've been included in the main game.

- They've literally massacred the Sonic 3 & Knuckles OST.
- Denuvo is causing performance issues on PC.
- Bugs, many bugs.
- The museum could have more content.

Anything positive?
Yes, the new cutscenes, the new missions, boss rush mode and the mirror mode.

Initial Reactions for Sonic 3 and knuckles (spoilers)

I grew up with the Genesis Games and I even have the damn strategy guide for Sonic 3 when it first came out. I was a huge Sonic Fan and I would still be if this series was just treated with the respect it deserves from its creators. Instead, once again, for the THOUSANDTH time since we've all started playing sonic. ""Just barely good enough"" is Sega's motto when it comes to these games.

The Good
-Widescreen
-Supposedly scales up to 4K, I have yet to even try that out
-Coins are a good incentive to travel throughout the whole game and grab as many rings as possible
-Super Sonic is Mapped to the Y Button like in Sonic Mania
-Tails Helper Controls are nearly perfect
-The camera controls seem to function better than the default controls in Sonic A.I.R, and you can now outrun the screen again. it's quite cool
-Ice Cap Act 1 and 2 and Launch Base Act 1 use their prototype music without many changes

...And the Bad

- The Music does not start or stop correctly in stages. Everything has a strange fade-in and fade-out effect.
- Special Stage Controls are tweaked, so if you're used to timing from S3/S3Air you will need to adjust
- For that matter it's sort of difficult to use the sound effects from the special stage as a reference point for when you need to turn because of how delayed they are
- The Special Stage music never speeds up as you play. So we went from S3 speed up too fast, S3K speeding up slower, and now S3K origins not speeding up at all... why?
- Many Sound effects are seemingly added in all over the place for no good reason, It makes some parts feel like I'm watching a flash/youtube fan movie
- Instead of letting you fruitlessly attack the first miniboss, they now arbitrarily lock you in place.
- The Super Sonic Music is absolutely terrible and I would've rather them played the invincibility theme if it was going to be this bad
- The Sonic 3 invincibility music is gone.. BUT they let you listen to it in museum mode for some crazy reason!
- Absolutely no gameplay customization options whatsoever as far as I can tell (not surprised...)
- Marble Garden's Crushers can now kill you from ALL SIDES rather than you needing to be under them... Ugh!
- Marble Garden's swinging spikeball hitboxes are bigger for some reason?
- A lot of things break really easily for the experienced players zipping through all the zones: Effects that are supposed to last for moments instead glitch out and last the entire level (For instance Marble Garden Zone when you first encounter the mini boss has debris falling and then it never stops if you run past it).
- Carnival Night Act 1 and 2 and Launch Base Act 2 music is god awful which is weird because the prototype music that was recently dug up would've been perfect to use. Either they used the wrong versions or Jun just plain out screwed up.

The worst offender of them all

-They list and let you listen to the ""unused music"" for sonic 3 in the museum mode, which the community has already agreed on being probably the prototype super sonic music, but Jun made his own track for the game that screams sonic 4 levels of bad and you cant. turn. it. OFF.

I'll update this as I go along but I really hope they fix the music up...

Edit: So supposedly the entire game is built up as a modification of Sonic Mania. That's interesting but what's REALLY screwed up is sega took these ports and forced them to run alongside the hedgehog engine that powers their 3D games. They hacked into the sound engine part of the Retro engine that powers the game and... absolutely butchered it.

So to break it down for you guys, and please leave a thumbs up if this makes sense...

Sega used their 3D game engine to replace the perfect sound that these games had to begin with on the retro engine... and on top of denuvo you are running a 3D game engine at the same time as these 2D engines. This isn't some sort of ""Haha technically..."" or ""Gotcha"". This is what's actually happening, does it now make sense why the game runs like ♥♥♥♥?"

I like this game, a lot actually, BUT
The question being asked is: would you recommend this game to other players? My answer is a big NO.
Dropping $40 isn't a big deal to me, but I understand many find that unfair, especially if you're on a budget. My biggest question is why does this even exist?!

But before I get into that, I will explain why I bought it. I got it because of the widescreen, achievements, and the ability to easily mix and match mods without having to patch a dedicated rom. That's honestly it. Classic Sonic is a childhood favorite, literally, so this collection has something special for me.

Now onto why I could not, and will not recommend this game. It's honestly a waste. It's a waste of money and talent. There are many iterations that exist for each of these games. I grew up with the original cartridges and the Sonic collection on PC many years ago and that did enough for me. The games have been available for pretty much every console ever, and I think you would save money if you just got them individually. Back in 2007 I got the lock-on for only 99 cents online!

Honestly, I don't see how this is worth it for anyone, even for those who are new to Sonic. Just get each game one at a time, and see if you enjoy them. Why buy a $40 lifeless collection if you have no idea if you will even like a single game. This collection was clearly for people who already love Sonic, and love the classic games. But here's the thing, if you don't like just one of the included games, instantly the collection becomes a complete rip-off. Personally, I don't like Sonic CD at all, so already I'm screwed, but as I mentioned before, it didn't bother me.

This collection is certainly nowhere near perfect. As many have stated, it's filled with bugs that certainly didn't exist in the originals, and there was certainly odd things that occurred that I know didn't happen in the originals. One thing that bothered crap out of me was the jumping felt off. If you were to jump and land and try to jump again the instant you landed, it doesn't register your input. I have no idea what's that's about, but that has costed me rings more than I can care to remember and certainly wasn't an issue I had with the original. As mentioned the physics felt a little weird as well.

When this game was announced, I had no idea why people were so hyped up about it. It just looked like a lazy cash grab. Even from the trailer it didn't look special.

In conclusion, honestly, do yourself a favor and just get the games individually. Don't waste your time with this piece of crap of a collection. It really has nothing special to offer for anyone."
sonic+origins,Recommended,19.7,"Posted: June 26, 2022
Unfortunately I did the dumb thing and preordered the deluxe version of the collection like the sonic simp I am. Welp.


MOANING AND COMPLAINTS:

-Sonic 3&K is my favorite 2d platformer of all time, but Sonic 3 AIR is a far better port than Sonic Origins. This collection hardly adds anything worthwhile outside of cutscenes and Mania's drop dash.

-All of the animated segments heavily feature Amy, but she still isn't playable in this for some reason.

-The DLC is ridiculous, and mission mode is hardly worth mentioning.

-I really wish the insta-shield was available in Sonic 1 & 2 outside of the stage select cheat. Having the insta-shield, elemental shields and drop dash in all the games is my favorite way to play the games, but I wish I could save when doing so.

-After all these years, Sonic CD is still incomplete. Don't get me wrong, CD's my second favorite game in this collection, but that game really needs a reason to collect all the timestones/destroy the generators, outside of the small part of the ending cutscene that changes when you do so. I'm hoping someday someone adds the cut finale, Final Fever, to Sonic CD.


WHY I'M STILL OK WITH IT:

-Coins are actually a neat replacement for Lives. As they function like lives, but for special stages only. You also use them to unlock concept art, videos and music. (Still, wish there was more to unlock with them.)

-Like any toxic relationship, I have hopes that Sonic Origins will pick up its act and include updates addressing most of my complaints. Should I hold onto that hope? Probably not, but I do so anyways.

-What I do like about Sonic Origins is that it's an easy all-in-one package to get normies into classic sonic. Not everyone is willing to hunt for all the individual fan remasters of all these games. These are some of my favorite games, and I think all the remasters included are pretty solid. Widescreen is how 2d sonic should be played.



QUICK INDIVIDUAL GAME REVIEWS:

Sonic 1
-----
-Remove(or redesign) Marble Zone and you got yourself a good game. I think Sonic 1 gets way too much flak. The game is still good after Green Hill.



Sonic CD
-----
-You gotta play this with the JP soundtrack or you're missing out on probably the best game OST ever. The levels here are all great playgrounds for sonic's movement.

-As I said above, I love this game but it feels incomplete. I wish there was just a bit more of a reason to explore all the versions of the levels. Like finding the chaos emeralds in the good future or something.



Sonic 2
-----
- The first 2/3rds of this game is great. But man, everything after Oil Ocean is rough.


Sonic 3 & K
-----
-The game that got everything right imo, the best of the series. Especially if you're just taking the original versions of each game into consideration. It had saves, let Tails fly, added Knuckles, elemental shields, act 1 bosses, the best special stages, bonus stages at checkpoints, great (story) pacing and some of the best level design. I used to think the only sore part of the game was Sandopolis Act 2, but maybe stockholm's syndrome has hit, and I don't even think that anymore."

Executive meddling messes up everything, as par for the course with Sonic. On one hand, there's finally an official modern port of Sonic 3 & Knuckles, but on the other hand, there's too many issues to ignore including new bugs that weren't present in the previous ports of Sonic 1, 2, and CD, the completely unnecessary use of the resource-hungry Hedgehog Engine for what should only really be a lightweight 2D user interface, lack of customization options in terms of settings (no filtering options, can only choose between ""classic"" or ""anniversary"" modes, only one save file per game contrary to the mobile ports, etc), and many more issues which would take forever to describe; a ""death by a thousand paper cuts"" type of scenario, basically. At least I got this for a bit less than full price, but I wouldn't recommend it unless they remove the hideous DRM and rectify the several issues present across the board."

So, I've been a veteran sonic player for 30 years (Yes, I am that old) and consider myself reasonably qualified to offer an expert opinion on the games included in this compilation.

These are great games that have stood the test of time, and to a ""die hard"" fan, I would say this collection is a must buy.

That said I cannot in all good faith recommend this game. The price point is WAY TOO HIGH. If I'm paying this kind of money, I am expecting some premium remaster, not some shoddy half job.

Sonic 1, 2 & CD, are fine… Though Knuckles cannot be played in Sonic CD and the music in Sonic CD is really quiet. A welcome return though are the lyrics to the JP/EU soundtrack for sonic CD.

Sonic 3&Knuckles is where it all goes wrong. First off, the awful soundtracks for Carnival Night, Ice Cap, and Launch base. I am paying £36.00… I want the OG soundtrack. Secondly, Sonic’s hitbox in this title seems really off, resulting in many squash deaths.
I would suggest waiting until this hits £19.99, and deffo waiting for the bug fix patch which is desperately needed."

SEGA. PLEASE.
Why is ""Classic"" mode locked to 4:3? Seriously, this is the kind of decision that I can't follow the logic of at all. I've been waiting ages for a 16:9 port of the game, and yet if I want to play the game with the challenge it was originally intended to have, I have to play it cropped for no reason? Like do you actually think the people who played the classic games are so hardcore that we wouldn't want to play the game in 16:9?

Please, for the love of god, just update the game and allow at least the option to change this. This is not something anyone would have asked for, nobody prefers 4:3. If they do, they're probably still playing the game on original hardware, and won't buy this version of the games anyway."

An Epic Collection! I've got not too much problems with it. It runs smoothly at a stable 60FPS. However, I wouldn't agree with putting a DRM because there are some other people who are suffering from this due to Denuvo taking down performance.

The only problems I had are:
- Drop Dash in Sonic 1 locks the controls
- Muffled Sonic 3 & Knuckles Soundtracks
- Getting Forced to open Nvidia Control Panel and force the game to use a dedicated GPU so it won't lag as heck.

Other than that. The games are perfectly good. I hope Sonic Origins keeps getting patched though so we can finally have the ultimate experience!"

i originaly did a review of this game when it came out but a lot has changed since than so i want to rewrite my review of the game
as you know its a collection of the genesis sonic games remade in a new engine with widescreen and sharper graphics and quality of life improvements
the game had a lot of issues when it came out but im happy to inform they patched those issues and fixed the game
the only problem that remains is the changed music from sonic 3 and knuckles but its a licensing issue so they couldn't do anything about it but thankfully it can be fixed with a simple mod
and the biggest reason i wanted to change my review was the PLUS expansion
it adds amy as a playable character and adds knuckles to sonic cd
it also adds 12 gamegear games that are running using emulation
and it also contains the digital deluxe dlc so you dont have to buy it separately anymore
thank god because it really didnt worth the 5 bucks
now you can get the plus and digital deluxe dlc for 10 dollors which is fair in my opinion
so if you want to buy this collection its a good time because its fixed now and does not have any game breaking issues anymore
if you think the price is too high just wait for a sale it will be worth it in the end"

You don't have max control, and you are control locked while spinning.
Some physics in Sonic 3 are so off, that it made think I was playing Sonic Spinball, of all things.
Certain achievements are broken, like the rhinobot one in Sonic 3; you can (not) enter a special or bonus stage, or else that count resets (for the session, not total). You can still 100%.
Game's fully moddable via third-party sites, but if you want to mod Sonic 3, you should grab AIR instead.
Otherwise, seeing that 60 FPS Sonic 2 special stage chute made me happy. That was about it."

- Sonic, and co needs to jump higher in Sonic 3.

- Some menu options within the game's menu's need to be moved to Origins main menu and not the game's menu.

Other than the above issues most issues I've heard, and seen online weren't apparent in my playthrough so far of the collection. I've seen many people talk about glitches, and graphics messing up, but they don't seem to exist in my 10 hours of playing the Steam version of this game at least.

The fact that SEGA had the nerve to make us pay 40$ on release then lower it to 30$ after many people already bought the game is just stupid. So now I and many other people have to purchase the FULL game for 50$ (Plus included) instead of the price now being 40$ for everything. The people who payed the original price for what is basically a paid emulator with some additions should get Plus for free or at least a discounted price. And removing the DLC that a lot of people (Including myself) paid for just to stuff it into Plus is just a ♥♥♥♥ you moment because the people who paid extra money to have some fun additions just paid more for no reason.

I've been thinking about how to start my review for a long time. As a long-time fan of the series who has been playing since Forza Motorsport 2, who has played every game since then (including the Horizon series), who has pre-ordered the Ultimate Edition of every game, and who has invested thousands of hours of playtime in the series, I am at a loss for words.

This is my first Forza that I've played mostly on PC, where I can switch between PC and Series X thanks to Cross Progression.

Turn 10 has promised a lot in the past, the trailers often looked better than the finished games, but never has the gap been as wide as it is with this installment. At no point does the game look even remotely as good as the original trailers, even with the maximum details on PC it doesn't come close to the video footage shown in marketing events.

Visually, the game fluctuates from ""quite respectable"" to ""really bad"", the latter especially when a vehicle model appears again somewhere that was copied over from an old game. ""From the ground up new"" this is not.

The ""career mode"" is one of the most boring campaigns I've played in the genre, the AI drivers are dumber than ever and the content has been greatly reduced. Fewer tracks, vehicles and features but more bugs than ever. Crashes, disappearing track textures and geometry etc. are part of the game experience here, the list of known bugs is longer than some PhD thesis.

Something must have gone wrong during the long development time. It remains to be seen whether Turn 10 can pull it out of the mud. At this point, I wouldn't recommend the game even to fans."

Worst £90 I've ever spent.
I've been a big fan of the FM series since FM2 on the Xbox 360 but this is a let down in so many ways. I'm sure this review is just echoing what others have already said but here's my thoughts after 17 hours of play time

The Good
- A good choice in cars from day one.
- Graphics look decent on the cars.
- Large choice in wheels for customisation.

The Bad
- Career mode is awful (""a mile wide but an inch deep""). You never actually see any proper racing, and in a game designed about track racing it seems like its more focused on being a ""take your daily driver to the local track day"" simulator than a full blown racing simulator.
- The steering wheel glitches/stutters constantly when racing using the driver's helmet cam. Almost like the steering wheel is being displayed at 10fps compared to the rest of the game.
- Car progression system is . Seriously, stop it. Change it. You should spend MONEY on car parts, and they should be unlocked at DRIVER level across the board. The reason you've done this is to force people to play the game more. You can't force player retention. Make a game that people WANT to play, not one they feel they HAVE to play.
- Money is pointless because of the aforementioned point, having to use CP to buy parts instead of money.
- Low resolution rendering of car images regardless of graphics settings when browsing the paint designs.
- No Nordschleife circuit at launch. Like the game has been in development long enough already and now we're expected to wait almost a year for arguably the most iconic track in all of motor sport??
- The AI is abysmal. They have zero track sense, will randomly turn into you (which then gives you a time penalty), push you off track, slam into you and pile up at the first turn in every circuit, and seemingly have impossible levels of grip once they manage to break away. If you DO manage to get out in front it seems they immediately forget how to drive at all. There's no middle ground.
- The penalty system is seemingly random and decides how much time to penalise you by (or if it even is a penalty at all) by a random coin flip system. Sometimes you run a tyre width over the rumble strip on the exit of a turn and get hit for a +2:00 penalty, other times you can completely ignore chicanes and cut them in a straight line for zero penalty.
- Online racing qualification system is also broken because of this. The game does not issue penalties but will randomly flag your lap if you go a pixel off the track, resulting in you being 3-5s faster than the entire field but having to start in 6th place,
- Handling of cars is very hit or miss on gamepad. Some A class cars handle like they're on rails and other S class cars (which should be already built as a ""racing"" car) seem to drive like they're on ice constantly.
- Animation of the steering wheel always seems to lock out at around 40 degrees from TDC in EVERY car, regardless of the steering angle, or any adjustments made.
- People abusing the self-driving car system online to give them a false safety rating is very annoying to deal with, might as well stick to career mode if I wanted to race against AI

Steam will not refund me this game (I tried) so it's going to sit in my library as a reminder to not buy games on launch day ever again. Wait until next year when they've released a load of DLC and fixed the game issues before buying."

Have played every Forza title since FM2 and huge fan of the series. Highly recommend finding a grey market FM7 copy and waiting for the devs to release content that's clearly being intentionally held back from this game to pad ""seasonal"" content schedules.

Pros:
+ The 'ground up' physics engine and handling feel noticeably better, if familiar.
+ The weather system is good, but not perfect.
+ The sound design is excellent relative to past Forza titles.

Cons:
- Bizarre car catalog, bizarre removals, bizarre amount of recycled models from 12 years ago.
- Leveling mechanic makes sense but is a forced constraint that ultimately needs tuning.
- The upgrading menu lacks a ton of information, no more dyno charts, no ability to preview sound, no ability to see details/changes at a glance (eg +13hp)
- Did I mentioned the recycled models? This game is the most offensive yet in terms of model inconsistency
- Menu system is awful
- Overall content is about 50% of what it should be

On its strengths alone, the game is legitimately a 7/10, but knowing how many egregious missteps there are, them charging $70-100 for this title means that, at best, it's a 6/10 overall and in terms of sheer value. This is the most disappointing entry for the Forza franchise by a landslide."

After 6 long years, we have been greeted with the worst and most disappointing Forza Motorsport to date. The PC version in particular is poorly optimized and should be avoided for the foreseeable future. The egregious leveling up system is done purposely to lengthen playtime and makes it a chore to progress through the game. There is no incentive to upgrading your vehicle at all. The overall performance leaves a lot to be desired and the lighting and graphics combination makes the game quite ugly even compared to much older racing games. The marketing for this game showed a totally built from ground up racing game but in reality this is an ugly, poorly made mess with assets ageing more than 15 years still in the game. The only good thing of note is the fantastic car physics which makes it pleasing to drive if you can ignore the plethora of bad game decisions and pure laziness committed by Turn 10. I cannot give this more than 3/10 in its current form and its lackluster track list further assists this bad result."

- Terrible career experience, lacks any actual race cars event, no ability to extend races length.
- AI is the worst you can think of, they drive like you don't exist on the track, a 5 years old kid is smarter.
- S15 still uses the same car model from what? 15 years ago?
- 5 hours nonsense, soulless grind to unlock parts for EACH car (500+ cars in game).
- FM 2023 is a visual downgrade to FM7 and FH5, but not only that also runs much worse than all previous titles on PC.
- T10 removed Nordschleife from the release so they can add it post launch and call it ""new content"".
- Replay mode is so broken that it would be better to not include it on the final version of the game.
- Photo mode does not have any of the improvements added in FH5.
- Formula Drift cars shown on the marketing materials? Non existent.

+ Physics is good tho."

I paid 100$ so you don't have to.
Making the review after playing the pre-release Premium Version for 35 hours.

The Good:

Forza Motorsport has the most realistic and consistent gamepad handling on PC money can buy right now.
The driving experience is sublime with highly adjustable difficulty, suitable for newcomers and veterans alike.
Multiplayer is solid and ""Rivals"" is amazing. Time trial leaderboards now allow you to copy tunes from leaders then try to match their pace.

The Bad:

The curated career is shallow. Some of the cars you can chose from for each event are underpowered, which is problematic with the current leveling system. Considering the wide range of cars available in the game, there are no dedicated Touring Car, GT3 or Endurance type of races, based on real life Motorsport events.

The car leveling system is extremely slow, considering the number of available cars. 3-5 hours per car to be more precise. This needs to be reduced significantly as it now resembles a free to play mobile game levels of grind. On top of that the order of the unlocks leaves many cars with useless upgrades in the early levels (more power to muscle cars but no handling upgrades for the first levels?)

The Ugly:

The current version of the game is poorly optimized, leaving majority of PC users struggling to get smooth gameplay experience. Many of the graphics settings simply don't work. On my 6800XT I couldn't get FSR to work. I couldn't even switch resolution from 1440p to 1080p. Changing settings requires restarts. On each restart the game recompiles shaders for 5 minutes. I've had about 20-30 crashes in 35 hours and 2 BSOD.

To pour salt in to the wound, the jump in visual fidelity compared to FH4&5 and even FM7 and Project Cars 2 from 6 years ago is arguable, considering that playing with Ray Tracing ""on"" at the moment seems to be reserved only for top of the line PC users.

The good news is the driving physics, fuel and tire mechanics, and multiplayer design are the best the series has ever been. However, the overall package, performance, and presentation are significantly lacking in this game at launch. Unless you're desperate, hold off on purchasing this game until the developers have had time to put in additional content and fix the numerous bugs and the odd design choices they've made that I think may need to be changed. There's a lot of work that needs to be done on this game for it to be considered a complete racing game.

The performance on an 8700K+RTX4070 has been inconsistent at 1440p. While playing with frame rate unlocked at a mix of ultra and high settings I can get FPS into the high 80s but this is accompanied by regular drops of about 20 FPS so I felt it required the 60 FPS lock setting which was a bit disappointing. The other disappointment comes in how the game looks, which frankly is not visually pleasing even at the highest possible settings and generally just not a sharp enough picture no matter what you adjust.

So overall it’s a bit of a mixed bag. The racing itself is engaging and fun but the choices the developers have made with this game for presentation and functionality leave much to be desired. If it receives good post-launch support it may correct a lot of those issues but at launch it’s a bit disappointing and I do not recommend buying it."

I love the game, truly - I dont love trying to modify my car and it looping on saving - then losing the last 2-4 races I've completed....

Edit since 1.1 - From 100% chance of looping, down to maybe 20% now.
Thats still a negative review from this guy, great game - shocking support as always with a ""AAA""

Edit 2 - Ok don't try and buy a new car now - that's a loop save too.

Edit 3 - just loop saved again, lost 2 races - Off to by a PS5 for something that rhymes with Gran Turismo

Edit 4 @ roughly 52 hours and latest update - I've had one crash from a race and one only, loop saving appears to have been corrected.

There is still so much with this game that is broken and unfinished, review remains negative.
Do not buy now.
The way content is drip fed is shocking and the grind to level up a car is a joke.
Still no object permanence on track - knocked out a brake marker? It's ok its magically back next lap!

Buy Gran Turismo, the real driving simulator - or do what I'm doing and playing Forza Horizon 5 again, because its a better game."

If you're new to Forza, it could be a good place to start. If you're not new to Forza, it's definitely an awful place to continue.

When they said they rebuilt the game from the ground up, they were lying. Bugs exist in this game that are identical in execution and effect as those that existed upon release of previous games. Performance is hilariously under par even on high-end systems. The single-player AI is actively worse and will never challenge you more than the mere existence of the edge of the track. M$ is deleting genuine reviews calling them out. Steam should absolutely be issuing refunds regardless of playtime for this steaming pile of embarrassments.

If you're a simracer with a gearbox, you flat out will not enjoy the first twelve laps of driving any car you acquire; They have decided to gamify your transmission by adding colossal artificial latency between selection and engagement until you unlock and install upgrades. If you're used to engine braking for real, that downshift won't even go through until you've overshot entirely. If you're used to engine braking as a reaction to your opponents, you will collide every time.

If the only thing you want is hot lapping and online multiplayer with a standard gamepad at 30-45 fps, more power to ya, could be great for that. If not, Maybe check back in another six years.

Weather artists killed it though. Still images look incredible. Too bad about the rest of this anemic cash grab."

We waited 6 years… for this? It’s crazy that Microsoft managed to undercook a cake that has been in the oven for 6 years. What’s supposed to be the definitive Motorsport experience is now walking on the same path as Halo Infinite: Release it buggy & incomplete, finish the game later.

“BUILT FROM THE GROUND UP”

Build from the ground up this, built from the ground up that.... It was by far the most stressed quote during Forza Motorsport’s marketing. Here’s what’s improved:

- Massively improved physics & handling model, including 8-point contacts for tires with 360hz update rate & better wheel support
- Fuel & Tire Strategy
- A new penalty system (which sometimes punishes the rammed instead of rammers)
- Challenge the grid for singleplayer, where you can choose the starting position before a race.
- Improved multiplayer with practice laps, qualifiers, Safety & Skill rating, spec races where everyone drives the same featured car with same upgrades & tuning.
- Skip lap in Rivals
- FOV slider for PC & XBOX
- And more…

And here are what's not:














My RTX 3060 laptop is struggling to maintain a stable 60 FPS even on lowest setting with DLSS on quality, meanwhile this mid-tier laptop has no problem getting 120+ FPS on the same lowest setting with no frame drops or stutters in FH5. And it’s not just my issue. People have been posting images where their RTX 4090 even fails to reach 40 FPS.

Even if I pretended that the game is well optimized & this is the max performance my laptop could produce, it’s still unacceptable. Not everyone has access to a RTX4090 & I9-13900K, and they shouldn’t cause even the mid-tier PCs to suffer even on lowest settings, just to make their game 10% more beautiful like Starfield. Remember, “diminishing returns” exists.

Visit , you’ll be stunned with the incredibly long list of issues. From the buggy replay system, infinite loading screen, to career mode not saving progress, people have been posting bugs & glitches everywhere on social media for the last few days. It makes me beg a question: What the hell have they been doing during the last 6 years? Where’s quality control?


Forza players have been asking for better career progression for years. They want to start with low-level/economy cars then slowly work towards high-end hypercars. Instead of that, Turn 10 gave us a Call of Duty-esque CarPG progression, Where instead of buying upgrades with credits, you have to level up to earn Car Points for upgrades. It’s a very controversial system. Some like it, while many others (including me) don’t.

Here's the good:


So why is it bad?







CarPG must've been made not to be fun & engaging, but with the sole intention to please investors by having players always repeating the same grind and prolonging the player numbers, hours played or whatever metric they aim for to present it to their investors.


Forza Motorsport is literally a great example of bad live-service games: release an early access buggy mess that meets the bare minimum of being playable, then improve it later with updates. While the core gameplay is still intact & incredibly fun, almost everything else is half-baked. It’s like a gem covered in stinky poo poo, when the owner doesn't respect its value. I recommend not giving them money & not pampering them for just passing the bare minimum, but instead buying this game 1 year later while on a sale, when the game is fixed."

For the love of everything. Wait a year and a half at least to see if they actually add the baseline day one content you are probably expecting it to have instead of getting it and trying to cope with such a hefty hunk of money for something so anemic.
Physics are the best they've ever been, would be weird if they weren't. Controller has a 25% deadzone on steering by default which is absolutely hilarious. Wheels have 5% on default, which is wrong.
The singleplayer might as well be one of their traditional 'DEMO's in length. Its about 10 hours to beat the whole game in singleplayer without making your own fun in freeplay. Which I think is what they expect you to do. Despite having less options than ever in freeplay and not showing you the layout or pictures from the track you're selecting. Hope you know your tracks. Theres also NO, and I mean ZERO, singleplayer tours with actual track racecars. Its hilarious and insulting at the same time.
CarPG rips the Forza customization out of the average players hands. Has to be changed and likely will at some point. Economy is still hilariously poor despite removing random rewards.

Want an authentic track experience? Get PC2 on a keyseller.
Want to mess around on tracks with some cars? Get Horizon 5 and go play on custom made tracks with your favorite cars.
Save your money, Economy is getting tighter every day. Its worth less every day. It'll probably be on the upswing by the time this game gets enough content or work to be recommendable, If they actually get to that point."

Good things first:
- cars' handling is excellent; feels quite realistic
- being able to drive new cars in actual circuit (Spa, Silverstone, etc.) is great
- engine sounds are nice

The bad outweighs the good unfortunately:
- poor optimization, no performance difference whether you choose low or ultra graphics
- stupid AI drivers who actually drive like robots, don't have the slightest idea of leaving a space during a race, and will pit maneuver you if you get too close
- lack of content (why provide drift suspensions and drag tires when there's no drift/drag content?),
- you can get penalized for getting hit (even though it's not your fault)
- no monza (how can you skip monza when you have Spa and Silverstone?)
- weird lighting issues, rims can look dark on daylights
- blurry car details even on ultra quality, Horizon 5 looks sooo much better than FM
- cockpit cam feels too stable, gran turismo 7 is much better in this aspect
- no nurburgring nordschleife (best layout, how can you skip this too?)

Tl;dr wait for discount next year when issues are hopefully fixed."

Sadly this is another one of those AAA rated games that held promise, but ultimately didn't deliver. This game has got some serious issues.

The car upgrade system, while a lot of people hate it, I can understand why it was done like this. It is to encourage longevity in the game, to keep people on that gristmill, grinding the next car. This is fine if you enjoy that sort of thing, but for a casual racing game, time gating upgrades, where people will often just pick up the game and play, seems like a poorly thought out idea.

The penalty system is good and an innovative implementation, but is an inconsistent disaster. There a huge issues with application of penalties, where an innocent party could be driven off track, or punted from an unsafe rejoin, only to be slapped with a huge time penalty for an ""avoidable collision"". This is while the person who rammed you off or caused a 3 car pile up receives no penalty at all in the view of our AI overlord.

This might be the best physics that Forza has to offer, but if this is 6 years in the making, I would rather get a PS5 and play GT7. The understeer is horrendous, every car in the game has it to varying degrees, which makes me think this is physics related. I understand that this makes it easier for controllers (i.e. the vast majority of the player base) but it seriously detracts from the overall ""driving"" experience.

The career mode unfortunately follows the Call of Duty trend of lacking anything meaningful. It feels like an after thought, an opportunity for those who don't want to play online to engage in some light racing with the AI. Talking of which, the AI is also pretty embarrassing; slow, clumsy, and irrational at the start of the race, but mega fast once the race opens up.

It isnt all bad however, the game itself looks really good, with some excellent particle effects and some very detailed tracks and the rating system seems a good enough implementation.

The game has its good points, but I feel Forza has missed the point; it has tried to be this compromise between being a casual experience and a proper racing title, but at the minute I feel it is neither. If the upcoming Assetto Corsa 2 builds on the promise of Assetto Corsa, Forza better watch it's back..."

In the current state FM is in, I don't think I can recommend this. I've been dying to have a controller-suited experience on PC for a while now, and I thought FM would be the good PC alternative to Gran Turismo since that isn't on PC either (love it though).

Way, way, way too many bugs right now. PC optimisation for this game is equivalent to putting your wiener in a spinning fan blade. The track can disappear in front of you, the frame rate is the most inconsistent thing ever no matter the graphics preset, and don't get me started on the infinite loading bugs. Seriously, it's insanely baffling that you can be a flagship franchise under Microsoft, be a triple AAA company, and vomit up something not nearly enough to satisfy the majority of your playerbase. I'm one of the die-hard few, although, it's more accurate to just call me one of the desperate ones.
As for positives about the game, there are only a few touches of grace here and there which primarily come down to the racing itself. Multiplayer racing is killer. It's got close-racing action and for the most part, cars are balanced. Penalties as related to the racing itself though... not so fun. You can get rammed by someone then hit into someone else and it can be your fault. Track limits too, but I feel this can be ironed out.

I don't think I've hated it hard enough. Even if you're looking for something to play, don't let yourself get convinced by the fun racing to be had. There's not enough content, no free play/server browser, campaign is bleak... even with the progression change, which the final upgrades required you to get your car to level 50 and could take 3-5 hours, getting your car to Level 25 still does not fix it entirely. Car points still restrict a lot, they really should have fixed this progression issue before launch. Everyone says the same stuff about who could have possibly QA'd this and said it was fine lol.

I'll still hold my breath. The devs got a lot of work to do to fix the important issues."

tuning time at the beginning. Say you pick a car you like, and you want to upgrade it to maybe race online? No you have to grind out the cars individual levels, there is a maximum of 50 levels and things like engine swaps and even changing the tire compound don't unlock till level 30 or 40. What else is insane is that even if you HAVE them unlocked, you only have a certain amount of CP points depending on the level of the car, so if you have enough upgrades to put your car up a class YOU STILL CAN'T DO IT BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH CP POINTS? This game is infuriating. It ♥♥♥♥♥ on the casual gamers, and also ♥♥♥♥♥ on the sim racers as well since not a single race wheel that isn't a crappy Xbox one is unsupported. If you look up guides online you'll see people saying ""Oh it's no problem you can level up your cars easily by just putting all assists on and letting the car drive itself around a track 50 times and checking your controller every 15 minutes."" SERIOUSLY? IS THAT WHAT ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ GAMING IS BECOMING NOW? WATCHING THE GAME PLAY ITSELF FOR 4 HOURS SO YOU CAN HAVE ONE CAR MODIFIED TO YOUR LIKING TO TAKE INTO MULTIPLAYER? WHAT THE ACTUAL ♥♥♥♥ HAVE THEY DONE TO US?

If I manage to get into a race without the game completely crashing, it's a solid game of chicken where there are very limited repercussions for T-boning someone in one of the first few corners.

What a complete farce charging people $70 for this. I'm not sure what the plan is TURN-10 but you better figure it out soon.

I would be SO embarrassed with what I sent out into the world with this game.

20 YEARS GUYS - HOW DO YOU SCREW THIS UP SO BADLY!?

Hey Folks,

Not sure what Turn 10 has been up to but this game is an absolute train wreck. The game is poorly optimized, riddled with bugs, and has limited series available on multiplayer. The CONSTANT reloading and disconnections associated with this game are completely unacceptable. I can appreciate the attention to detail with the vehicles, they definitely look very pretty and the new upgrading mechanics are something I've come to like. However, I feel like half the game is missing right now.

Hear me out... I can't believe that a bunch of effort went into the race tracks. The vast majority that are within the game right now are existing and have been in each Forza game since 2005. I imagine that some time went into the physics engine for those tracks and I can appreciate the effort. I cannot understand how so little time (perceived) went into the front end or the match making process or QoL.

I've been playing Forza since it's inception in 2005. I loved it, played it to death with the boys, and made some great memories. It's extremely disappointing to purchase ANOTHER game from a Microsoft backed studio that is simply not finished. Halo Infinite wasn't finished, Starfield wasn't finished, and now Forza.

Microsoft, stop selling unfinished products for full price. If you're going to send a half baked game out into the world, charge a price similar to an indie game.

TLDR - this game isn't ready for consumption right now. Save your money, go play the last Forza, wait until you see the ""User Reviews"" change to 'Mixed'. That'll be your signal that the game has finally been adjusted when new reviews come up."

I cannot in good faith give this game a positive review. I am a big fan of the Forza franchise, but man did Turn10 drop the ball on this one. I cant stress this enough that this game is **NOT** worth 100 dollars. Forza Motorsport feels rushed, unfinished and just plain EMPTY. The content is completely lacking, and I do not for 1 second believe that Turn10 wants to ""remake"" the Nurburgring, they simply just want to drip feed us recycled content over a period of time.

So many features that were in the past Forza games are just not present in this one. Forzavista feels unfinished and lacking elements that FM7 had. No drag racing, no drift mode, no car stats to track mileage or win ratio. There are so many bugs and glitches in this game that this is completely unacceptable for a game indevelopment for 6 years!!! Ive come to conclusion that Turn10 is just a sloppy incompetent developer.

The physics are excellent and the cars feel authentic to drive, the AI does give a really good challenge but they too have their own set of issues. Every track has dynamic time of day and weather, although the dynamic weather feature is BROKEN as the game always favors rain 99% of the time. This is about the only positives I can think of.

Do not pay 100 dollars for this game...it is not worth it. This game lacks so much I am hard pressed to even pay 40 dollars for this. Forza Motorsport feels like a lazy attempt and now I know not to trust this developer going forward. What a disappointment."

DON'T BUY THIS TRASH! Not if you value your sanity!
THE BAD STUFF!
Out the box issues:
5-20 minutes ""optimising shaders"" every time I launch it despite making ZERO changes to the settings.
FFB is utterly comical and you need to spend HOURS just to get some feeling out of it.
ABS, TC and stability have just 3 settings on, sport and off.
When using on and sport these fight all your inputs causing the cars to weave like they're drunk or on Acid and following an imaginary track.
TC off causes uncontrollable and unrecoverable spins if the AI touch you (last game I encountered this in was Dirt 3 using a controller back in 2012-2013).

Graphics:
GFX artifacts all over the place. some on the car windscreens and right in your damned face.
Barriers switching from white to black to white again right at the point the LOD pops in.
Trees changing colour as you approach them (caused by the ludicrously short shadows and LOD popping in).
Car tyres leave trails behind them like black pixie dust, no it's not skidmarks either...
A permanent ghostly halo around your drivatar when viewing the grid. (are my eyes getting bad or summat?)
Permanently blurred visuals for ANYTHING more than 20 feet in front of your car, that leaves you feeling like someone's smeared vaseline on your screen or your eyes need testing and flat out causes headaches after 30-40 minutes. (Ahh good my eyes are just fine then TFFT!).
ABYSMAL fps rates even on a £1000+ GPU. 50-60fps on a 7900XTX at max settings yet STILL blurred to HELL and this just gets WORSE if you reduce settings to get acceptable fps rates.
Locked fps in multiplayer to half your screen refresh rate because it's ""unfair"" to console owners.
FPS locked to 60 fps in Rivals. REGARDLESS for the same reason. because the default settings on console gives just 30fps at 4K.
Oh and replays? Locked to 16:9 aspect ratio even on a 32:9 display and no way to save them (thank GOD for that at least!)

Controls:
Massively limited in car control options, no TC, ABS or brake balance adjustments etc even in cars that HAVE this irl.
No way to assign these even if they WERE in the game.
Tyres that might as well be shopping trolley wheels giving naff all confidence the car is gonna go where you point it.

""Advanced AI"" ROFLMAO!
The ""Advanced AI"" is a complete JOKE battering you off track for no reason.
Rear ending you like you don't exist.
Braking on main straights for NO REASON.
Sliding off track at random, again for no apparent reason (I guess even the AI thinks the handling is PANTS).
That completely gives up once you DO get ahead.
Can't replicate their own practice times in races.
Sure as HELL can't race given I ended up 2 MINUTES ahead with max AI and started from the back of the grid and ended up in 1st after T2 on the 2nd damned lap, Closest AI was over 30 seconds behind me.

Other peeves...
No qualifying in races other than online.
Random starting positions in races outside the career mode. you have NO option to chose (it took me 30 attempts and over 2 HOURS to get close to the back of the grid for a last to 1st challenge to compare the AI to AMS2 because of the DISASTROUS AI and this random grid BS).

The worst FM launch yet. Its been 10 days since early access was given and not a single patch for any of the bugs.

UI design is horrible for anyone on PC and/or that uses a wheel.

Missing cars that have been in the series forever, surely to be added later for more money.

Missing tracks that have been in the series forever (no Nordschleife, really turn 10?) surely to also be added later for more money.

Driving with a wheel and using manual with a clutch is scuffed. IDK how they thought taking that long to shift a car was anywhere close to deserving to be in a game with ""Motorsports"" in the title.

Graphics issues and terrible FPS even for people with high end PCs.

The list goes on. I'm sure a lot of this stuff will be patched, but this game groups Turn 10 with all the other lazy AAA developers like EA and Ubisoft.

This game was the perfect example of why you dont buy games until they've been out a bit, why you dont pay for early access, and why game developers do not deserve to charge over $60 bucks for half developed trash."

I wasn't sure if I would like this game coming from FH4/5 and GTA racing most recently, but I must say it has been a pleasure, just takes a little bit getting used to. Driving feels amazing, way better than FH5 obviously, and I've been really enjoying it. Sure, the car leveling is one thing to be discussed, but it doesn't take enough away for me to not highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys racing games."

Optimization and fixes should be done during the 5(?) years of development, not after launch. Also, ""Built from the ground up"" is just not true. This release has the same bugs and exploits that have been present in the last several (FM and FH) releases. It's not a bad game, but it is a bad release.

I was really looking forward to this FM but.
-It still crashes after nearly every campaign race.
-There's hardly any cars and tracks.
-Its repetitive, you cant just buy car parts you want, you have to grind.
-AI cars are completely ♥♥♥♥.
It does have good graphics though.

Update after the latest patch 1.1
Start up the game, Wait for the shader's again. Then the game still crashes after every 5 lap campaign race.

Let's be clear. Is this game perfect... No. Is this game fun... Yes.

I'm a casual PC sim racer who mostly plays iracing and ams2 with the occasional dirt 2. I do have a full wheel and cockpit with triple screens. This is not a sim, but it is a simcade and for me scratches that itch when I want to race, but don't want to take it too seriously or only have enough time for a quick race.

I did a lot of research on some wheel settings to use in my Moza software along with in game and then have been tweaking from there. It definitely isn't as bad if you have a good starting point. I never expected it to be sim level and was actually surprised it wasn't as bad as people were making it out to be.

On that note, the cars, especially the starter ones are super understeery. As you level it up you can unlock things to improve that. I just learned to adapt to it and give the car what it needs and I have been able to hit all target times on level 5 difficulty with expert ruleset in place.

You'll read a lot of reviews about bad AI. I honestly think that aside from iracing AI in private sessions this may be one of the better ones. If you aren't a perpetual dive bomber who expects everyone to get out of your way even if the corner isn't yours you often will have clean races. I do admit that the race starts are a little odd, but it's easy to adapt to if you have some racecraft. You don't win the race on turn 1.

I personally enjoy slowly upgrading cars as you get experience with them. It can be a grind if you are Uber competitive and want everything right away or play nom stop, but for casual fans who like to learn their car and just enjoy the race it really is quite fun.

Multiplayer is hit or miss and I haven't done much of it yet, but honestly had cleaner races with AI so far.

The main bug I've ran into is that I have to rebind my pedal inputs from my Moza pedals every time I log in. It is irritating, but takes 3 seconds and doesn't break the game for me.

Overall, I enjoy the game and think many casual racers who don't always have the time or energy for iracing/acc, but think FH5 is too arcadey with not enough proper track races or proper racing rules in place.

I hope this helps someone as I'd like to see people having fun with this and continue to get updates and attention for a long time."

I've been lucky enough to not have most of the problems everyone else seems to have. Game runs fine, the singleplayer is basically just there to funnel you into multiplayer. Online racing feels incredible, safety ratings mean you see a *lot* less rammers compared to other Forzas.

I'd give it a Maybe if it was an option, but from my experience it's a Yes. Get it on Game Pass or on sale in a few months when most of the issues are fixed."

Most entertaining racing experience I've had in 20 years. This is a terrific bundle of potential that can only get better.

Pros:
Is the ANNOYING HELICOPTER there from FM7? He's still here but NOT NEAR AS LOUD. Most of the time I can't even hear him but when I do it is subtle. I don't recall seeing him during practice.
Tire model is absolutely fantastic. All the people saying this game is just another Forza must be using a gamepad because with a wheel in full simulation mode with no assists, the game is terrific and light years ahead of the previous titles.
Suspension geometry in general is vastly improved. Drive the '73 911 in FM7 then drive it in this game and see for yourself.
The previous titles were so arcadey when it came to the race cars and anything super fast that I exclusively drove the production cars under 700hp because the grip was unrealistic and the cars didn't compare anything to a true sim. Comparing this game to my real life '20 Mustang and my buddy's '15 Charger, my hats off to Turn 10 for finally getting it right.
Each tire type really feels different which I love. Comparing stock, street, sport and racing is a highly noticeable change in feel.
Turn 10 has always been really good about sound design and that hasn't changed. The cars appear to all have unique sound effects and are very high quality. Changing exhaust or increasing the size of turbos or SCs is highly noticeable.
The previous games were bad about giving you too many free cars and tons of money but then making everything extremely expensive. This game is the opposite with cars being cheap and parts free but money is harder to earn.
Part are a divisive topic: the new car progression system, I personally love it. You have to drive a car to level it up and unlock part availability then use car points to equip them. You can never lose those points so you can swap around different parts without blowing money on something you wish you didn't buy. It creates a sense of development almost like an RPG or something which I like.
I used to get bored and struggle to think of what to do but now I know I have constant projects/goals that I want to achieve.
Career races are another divisive topic. When I am playing singleplayer, I just want a fun race. With this system, I turn some laps to see about how fast I am at that track and then adjust the difficulty as needed to guarantee a close race then adjust where I want to start out in the race and fight for a podium finish. I think it is a terrific system that guarantees a close and fun fight. Multiplayer racing still has qualifying which makes more sense.
Gone is that stupid homologation system from the last game. Now you customize your car as you want and the AI drivers match you by using as many points as you did so it is always a fair race. It also means, you can see 10 of the same car in a race and all 10 could be totally different. One might have racing slicks and a wing but another might have a wide body kit and a turbo. Totally random and I love it. The cars aren't just different colors too, some have liveries even with drivatars turned off.
AI: I was skeptical when the video came out demonstrating the game for the first time. They said it was their best AI yet and then in the same video the idiot AI all drove a single file line with no use of a racing line and even go off track. But that must have been an early version of the game before the AI was ready because the AI is actually really good. Not the best, but still very challenging. There is one caveat which I explain in the cons below. Above all, the AI doesn't cheat anymore and that was the biggest flaw from the last game.

The cons:
Practice sessions exclusively start you out on a rolling start.
Career races are WAY TOO SHORT! Sometimes just 2 laps around an average size track.
Free play races can still be created so you can come up with your own custom races that are as long as you want, BUT...they don't have the same modes as the Career races. There is no practice and you can't choose your starting position. It is like the free play mode from FM7 where you either choose to start at a random spot or you all get in order of PI. They desperately need to make the career style racing available in free play AND they need to add in custom championships if they want to truly compete with folks like Automobilista and the like.
AI issues: while I praised them up above for finally following a racing line and not cheating...they practice collision avoidance a bit too strongly. They aren't perfect and there are still racing incidents...but here is what I mean. They are overly passive. They fight you right up until you are about a half car ahead and then they straight up pump the brakes...not let off the throttle and let you by, I'm talking straight up pump the brakes and end up like 2 seconds back in a heartbeat. On one hand, they finally show they are smart enough to be aware of your presence, but on the other, they are soft, no other way to put it. We need an aggression slider or at the very least, we need them to let off the throttle instead of hitting the brakes to create distance as it makes it too easy to win a corner.

Performance gets its own section:
Stability: I never had a crash in a race in 64.7 hours. I had one single crash in free play mode testing various settings and constantly reloading the same race over again to see the driver lineups. That was likely self-induced so I ain't worried about it. I had two instances of an infinite loading screen, one trying to start the game up on like day 3. No biggie, killed it and tried again and it worked. The other was when changing parts on a car, it said saving forever and I had to kill the game and start it back up. Lost my changes but it didn't happen again when I made the same changes so it wasn't a repeatable bug tied to any of my changes. Game consistently runs at 90-120fps for me and I love it.
Ray tracing: Bugged at the moment and has horrible stuttering at certain tracks and in certain lighting conditions. I can play with it on but it is too annoying so I turned it off until they patch it. I am not mad, it is a brand new game, let's let them fix it up some.
In addition, the optional ambient occlusion part of ray tracing is awful and causes certain wheels to look like blurry plastic. Wouldn't be a problem if you could turn it off separately but it is linked to the ray tracing mode that effects the track lighting and environments so this is a problem that NEEDS to get fixed.
The V-sync drama - For me, the game will not let me turn V sync off. Normally I want it on but it causes the whole game to lag like crazy and becomes unplayable. I tested at lowest possible settings and still couldn't get a steady 20fps. When I switched to a window it all the sudden ran perfectly. I tested some more and found out that the setting to disable vsync doesn't work and it stayed on no matter what when switching back to full screen. Weird!? Doesn't happen to my buddy so I am annoyed. There is NO BORDERLESS WINDOW MODE so I had to use the NVidia control panel to force vsync off so that I could play it smoothly.
With vsync forced off and ray tracing off, the game is gorgeous and works flawlessly. I run 1440p ultrawide with DLSS at ultra quality with DLAA on and everything is on high or ultra. Even at night and in the fog or rain with 24 cars on track. Running a 3090ti / i9-12900k / 32GBs-DDR5-5200 / 4thGen-NVMe

Conclusion:
The game is not perfect but is extremely fun and has loads of potential. Compared to FM7 on launch which was so bugged and had memory leaks so bad that I couldn't even browse the wheel selection, this game is a godsend. Are you looking to replace something as advanced as iRacing? This isn't it. Are you just looking to get your simrig out of the closet and have a blast with some awesome cars?

To begin with, I'm an experienced sim racer (iRacing, ACC, GT7, F1, Project Cars, AM, etc.) and had cautious expectations going into this title. I've been trying both controller and wheel (TGT-2) and have some thoughts to help those of you curious about FM. I race with no assists.

For the wheel, the FFB is actually pretty decent once I got the wheel working which isn't supported annoyingly. The FFB accuracy is a touch under GT7 if you consider it a direct competitor and of course ACC/iRacing but way better than the likes of F1 2023 (feeling the limit is important). To my surprise, I could feel the edge of the grip, the weight transferring around, and what the car was doing most of the time. Update 1.0 added some good improvements especially with the tire/tyre model. Throttle control and trail braking are a thing which is nice for the more experienced racers.

The RPG system is so-so but I did feel like a proud papa raising my cars up in career mode, feeling the changes the racing components were making on performance. I can see how many racers don't want to deal with that for every car though but it is what it is. Just make a free race and turn all assists on for auto drive quick leveling while not actively playing.

Speaking of tuning, I'm usually pretty lazy about this in other sims and get setups other tuners but I'm actually liking figuring out my own setups with a loose front for rotation to get that corner exit boost. This is where I believe the RPG system has a purpose in that as you upgrade components and tweak your tune, you see the changes and understand the puzzle in how to piece together a competitive set-up. Shameless plug, look for my tunes in game.

The tracks all look amazing. For now, there are only 20(?) with some variations in layout but according to T10, they will be doing monthly updates so I imagine things like the Nordschleife, Monza, Fuji, Daytona, etc will be added incrementally. Yes there is a bug where the track and/or environment disappears, reminiscent of Rainbow Road in Mario Kart, which I think is really just the shadow realm invading my reality. It's super fun when it happens on the last lap or two but my muscle memory accepts the challenge!

For the AI, P1 and 2 are surprisingly quick sometimes and the others have some pretty liberal driving standards but it kind of adds to entertainment value during the race. Choosing to look at this as an opportunity because lets be honest, I've never met an A.I. that didn't want to punt me off to the realm of shadows, I consider these A.I. races as more practice for ""chaos avoidance"" in multiplayer. By racing smart and choosing the right opportunities, I've been able to put their shenanigans in my rear view mirror, watching as they fly off into Barry R's firm embrace.

For controller racing, I think with practice, anyone can be just as fast with the wheel if not faster, especially with that birds eye from behind view. The inputs have that same nice feeling as the Horizon series without the ""twitchiness"" of F1, GT7, and well pretty much everything. Forza is the best out there for it's amazing controller handling.

For the sound design, the engines are a 7/10 with similar characteristics that I'm used to from other sims. The contact sound would benefit from some variation as no matter the degree of impact, it's always the same ""clunk.""

For multiplayer, I found even at a 4700+/5000 rating there are still bozos everywhere in lobbies but I've had some really good clean battles too. Either put it on pole or employ maximum chaos avoidance by starting from the back and letting all the clowns fly off into Barry R in the races opening turns and you'll be good. The level of competition isn't as stout as iRacing, ACC, or GT7 but driving cars other than meta is always refreshing (finally the WEC Champion Corvette!). Hopefully the skill level improves and the top split races can be better in the future. With the Netcode pretty stable, it's definitely possible to have some thrilling wheel to wheel races with fellow skilled sim racers even with the dreaded low latency warning. Coming to a close with a final note on the format of the races, there are multiple series with multiple tracks per series instead of the same track all week. Variety is the spice of life and it's sure tasty presented in this fashion.

Overall, not being overly entitled and ignorant to the complexities of designing a multi-platform video game, I'm more forgiving when I'm mostly having fun. I don't expect my racing sims to hold my hand through some story arc (I'm looking at you F1) so I don't care about that as I'm just here to go flat out. It's nice to have something to just pick up and race without so much seriousness around my rating like iRacing, ACC, and GT7. Is it perfect? No i.e. bugs, crashes, mid-tune freeze ups. Is my fun factor outweighing these cons? Not anymore after 70+ hours of heartache with all the bugs, especially on the wheel. There is a good foundation that just needs more polishing."

Many bugs.... Road disappearing completely, I mean actually disappearing so that you see the void underneath as if the texture is no longer there, and you are still driving on the surface of what was visibly a road. Some artifacting on shadows, surfaces and even the sun beams have artifacted into my face. Very disorientating. Manual+clutch still feels sticky but it is workable, by no means a simulated experience because why would you have some one with a wheel set up be slower than using a controller? Their ""advanced ai"" are no more than children told to drive real fast, they'll slam into you for no reason, run you off the track... Overall a garbage experience there. Similar to online, really. Only difference is in solo, you are playing a fair field. Online though, if you haven't grinded out your car levels, you'll be matched with players who have properly maxed their cars and be easily left behind 20+ seconds, even if you drive the line perfectly. I know because I maxed out my car(s) before going in and stomped all the stock cars... which would just ram you at their first chance they got. Haven't been able to play a proper race with damage, fuel and tires on because it doesn't feel like anyone wants to play it that way. Go back to FH5, that is the arcade experience you are looking for.

All in all, the game is quarter-baked for a premium price and it definitely shows. Execs should have kept it from the public for another year.

Edit: Patch 1.1 only fixed one or two instances of infinite loading/saving. Still experiencing such in other various scenarios. FPS is better overall, though.

Edit 2: Attempted a long race (100 laps on le man) only got through 60ish laps before the game began to stutter and chop immensely. I know it was the game as this is on a fresh install of windows 11, my hardware is much more than adequate for what graphics settings I was running it on. Thankfully didn't have any issues before this. However, at around lap 88, things began getting really choppy and slow before I received a blue screen of death. All hardware is known working without any issues or over heating problems (memtest and other monitoring programs tell me so) It was meant to be an endurance test of my abilities and the update they released. If I could downvote further than simply saying no, I would. Even though I received this for free, I wish I could receive a refund any way.

Edit 3: November 14th, 2023; Patch seems to have fixed several complaints that I had with the game, namely not being able to run at native aspect ratio/resolution (32:9 5120x1440) and frame rate has been improved (capped 120fps) However, cut scenes are now quite choppy some times. Not a huge deal.

As a long time Forza fan who has played every Forza Motorsport & Horizion series since Forza Motorsport 2 release.. it's hard to recommend FM 2023 in its current state.

I haven't experienced any major performance issues (playing at 4K 60fps w/ 7950X3D & RTX 4090) on Ultra settings with RT on. I've never once dipped below 60fps and I've been playing since early access day one. There were few minor texture bugs here and there but nothing too serious.

My biggest issue with the game is BORING campaign, NOT ENOUGH tracks and the whole leveling up system which is an ABSOLUTE PILE OF ****!!! Leveling up cars entirely ruins the game for me without being able to mod cars, swap engines, swap drivetrains until you grind endlessly and by that point you want to drive something else. Also! Not being able to buy car upgrades with regular game credits just adds to the list of negatives.
All the changes made for FM 2023 are for the worst. Old system worked great and most FM player base enjoyed it. Improving old system would have been the proper way to go about it. Instead it seems as if Turn 10 took all their worst ideas and made the game based on them. Devs need to listen to community and make the necessary changes to improve the entire game experience.

The only positive thing about the entire game is physics which in my opinion is on point.

Also thanks Turn 10 for releasing a separate car pack around launch when it should have been included in a Premium Edition. I guess you haven't milked us enough..."

What a disappointment. After waiting years for this game and being a fan of the series since 2, this is by far the worst attempt of a racing simulator. This game is not aimed at the car enthusiast or a race fan. Who is going to buy a flywheel before an intake, exhaust, rims or tires? The car RPG does not work. People want to spend credits from WINNING races to upgrade their car. It makes no sense bringing in 2 forms of in game currency. The career mode blindly leads you into a series with 3 choices of cars while the rest of the field has whatever they want, you can't see the upcoming tracks, and can't upgrade a car the way YOU want to upgrade it. What a let down."

Career Mode, Builders Cup is great mandatory practice mode that can skip when are on the track, during the competition when manage to improve the car with a suspension and some racing tires you finish the category!

Graphics, it's ok but i expected better, FH5 has better quality!

Physics and driving are arcadey but enjoyable to play, the sensation of pushing the tires to the limit and feeling each pass through the kerbs!

Al definitely needs a patch, sometimes it feels like wreckfest!

Damage System needs to be improved sometimes the cars feel like they stick together when they touch!

Car Upgrades, as we drive the car goes up to level and unlocks upgrades, i like but doing this for each car will be tedious!

Easy to adapt with Steering Wheel or Controller!

If I could get my money back, I would. AI as usual is hot garbage, cant even take turns without getting LITERALLY BODIED by the AI drivers. The new progression system really sucks. Cool that they wanted to try something different, but I really dont feel like leveling every ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ car in the game just to modify it. If you wanted multiple of same car you would have to level those duplicate cars you purchase. My experience with the physics is just... eh. I mean I sure do love loosing grip just from barely tapping the gas. Constantly fighting my wheel just to stay stable. Driving its probably fine for controller players, I wouldnt on wheel. Credits are only used to buy cars now. Also kinda runs like crap. All i wanted was a Gran Turismo on PC and this... this is not it. Game is mid, move on me thinks.

forza+motorsport,Recommended,54.2,"Posted: October 16
So far I love the game. The physics are definitely a step up from FM7. That being said, they're a little tricky at first to get a handle on especially on wheel. I'd suggest looking at HokiHoshi's wheel setting guide to get that fixed up. Another tip, throttle control in this game is pretty essential that way you don't hit the gas too hard and eat a barrier on T1. On breaks, same thing. Don't slam them too hard, especially with ABS off that way you don't go sliding off the side of the track.

Graphics/Performance: Its a bit heavier than I'd like on my PC but after messing with the settings, I can push 60 frames at 1440P pretty nicely. The graphics are iffy but I'm hoping with the fact that they're a live service, that they'll fix the issues asap. The lighting is very good in some cases especially in darker scenarios like while its raining or at night. Sometimes the cars lack quality even by Forza standards when going around the tracks, the harsh lighting blotting out some of the detail on the vehicles.
When in regards to crashing, I haven't crashed once or had many issues, if at all playing the game. However, I may be an outlier as I've heard of people having issues with this game. It runs decently well, for me, for the most part. I will say I've had frame drops both before and after Nvidia released nee drivers. I found that racing in the rain with many AI is what hits the game the hardest, especially with LMP and Prototype cars on the track.

Sound: The car sounds in game are very interesting to say the least. Higher pitched car sounds like the 4-rotor in the 787B or the K24 in the CTR sound great. Other cars, like the 2016 Camaro ZL1 are a bit shaky and while the supercharger does sound nice, the exhaust has a muddy sound, even while using a higher end pair of headphones. The turbo sounds are very good, they DO still have that weird ""instant spool"" the franchise is kind of known for, but the BOV on touring cars or other turboed cars sounds very clean. The RS3 LMS and RX8 single turbo is proof of this. Cars also seem to sound like they properly idle which isn't something I expected but its a nice touch.

Cockpit sounds something that was pretty good in FM& have been greatly improved in this game. They sound much more true to life, and admittedly, I've found myself using the cockpit even more than I'm used to doing in a Forza game.

Camera: There are quite a bit of different camera angles in this game. Chase close, Chase far, cockpit with wheel, cockpit with gauges only, hood, and bumper orientations. Each and every one can have their FOV changed but remember to turn on said setting. There is also a drift camera mode in cockpit, I haven't used to just yet but I feel like it can help with finding the Apex on a track. The sense of speed honestly isn't too bad, better than what FM7 offered.

Menu/UI: For the most part I'm alright with it. However, for someone that's just playing this game, they might not be able to find the ""Restart race"" button right away. At the time of writing this review, you simply go as if you're quitting a race and it happens to pop up in a sub-menu, along with, the ability to quit the race right below it. There's other gripes too like I also have a weird flickering line on the border of my screen but its not enough to bother me, plus I only ever see it whilst on the main menu.

Customization: Here it comes. I love the game and the fact I have to actually level up my car like a proper RPG. Why? Its proper progression and I'm relieved that I can't immediately go in and toss a centrifugal supercharger or a new engine in my RX8 for example. Yes, its not for everyone, but for something that lacked progression in its previous game in the series, I think this is a step in the right direction. I do think its a shame though it takes a while to earn things like bodykits for the car. I do wish we had more body customization, but I'm relieved to see a wide variety of rims.
The Car Point aspect (I'm not abbreviating that lol) is a mixed bag for me as I do enjoy balancing out my points across car stuff, but on the other hand, it can frustrate me a bit whenever I have to debate whether to go for handling over speed constantly instead of a mix of both.

Physics: AS I said before, its a bit shaky to start with at first, but overtime it becomes much easier to drive once you get the hang of it. I suggest changing the deadzones for the breaking and acceleration when you first get the game. It helps quite a bit and makes the game enjoyable. ""its not super realistic!!!!"" Well, its a sim-cade. Its got simulator aspects and arcade aspects combined into its physics style. While the physics themselves are much more realistic than FM7, its clear that they didn't push too far into sim category to the point where Controller people wouldn't be able to enjoy it. That being said, the ""Simulation"" option for steering feels much better on a wheel, especially once you adjust settings for it whether you got a Direct-drive or a gear-driven/belt-driven wheel. I use the G920 and after adjusting some settings, I found the game very enjoyable. I love driving around Spa, Mid-Ohio, and the Hockenheimring.

Track selection and car selection: The track selection isn't too bad to be honest. Its a shame Nordschliefe isn't in the game, but the tracks overall HAVE been redesigned so I suppose it does makes sense that brutal of a track doesn't exist in the game just yet. They do have the GP circuit for the Nurburgring though. For cars on the other hand, this being Motorsport means there is a lot more Motorsport oriented cars in the roster. So far, I've been enjoying the LMP cars quite a bit. Some other cars I expected to cross to FH5 originally like the RX-3 and the Pininfarina Battista. Oh yea, for 22B lovers, they remodeled or at least improved the models on the Subaru 22B.

Overall I rate this game a 8 out of 10. I love it but many issues or oddities within the game itself me from pushing it to a 10/10."

Is it fun? Oh yes it is, very fun. The driving is lively, the gamepad controls are tight and after 3 hours it reminds me of a fun crating day with my mates. It's arguably the best FM game in driving and racing department since... Ever? Great job, lads!

Is it broken? Oh yes, it's a Yugo Zastava of gaming at the moment. Let's ignore server issues altogether (they can be fixed fast). The car leveling system is grindy, abysmal, rewards you with BASIC FEATURES IN OTHER GAMES, and kinda useless. The visuals is all over the place. It's stuttery, assets and overall presentation are inconsistent and to be quite honest, you need to retire half of car models already. Sometimes it's kinda pretty, but overall it looks like an Xbox One game with added (and broken) RTX mods.

And just like the liquids in Yugo it's prone to leak (memory). It's also crashes a lot, like a test dummy. Like Yugo's speedometer FPS is floating around solid 30's. On an 3080 in 2K with RTX off. There are a lot of visuals bugs too, like broken LODs, broken car spawning and othe Cyberpunk 1.0 worthy type of weirdness.

AI acts like your mates on M25: hit or miss. Usually they hit you and miss apexes to javelin into your rear. AI is prone to cheat at difficulty 3+ with better tyres too and career balance feels broken to be honest.

Launch content is simply barebones as a Soviet-era Lada Riva. Career is 40+ something races and that's it. Finished like 20% of the entire SP in 3 hours. And no Green Hell on launch in 2023? COME ON!

Wheel support is hot trash, it is so counterintuitive to calibrate T300RS that I've gave up. Gamepad support is good though.

Overall, there is somewhat engaging driving sim that is buried somwhere beneath this early access title, but you should consider it only after Turn10 performs a few long pit-stops. It's clearly not worth your time now."

Update 1: Game update 1.0 has been released and car progression in the career has been improved, so you get to important upgrades in much less time.

They have killed Halo, and now it's Forza.

I've been a Forza Player ever since the first release. I've played every single major release (Motorsport+Horizon) and I am confident in saying that this game only has 1 thing going for it at launch.

And that's the driving simulation. They have really enhanced the simulation quality and the cars feel very nice to drive, you can even get to that point.

Because, the mingin' performance makes the game unplayable, the graphics, ironically, look really bad, don't deliver on promises made in the initial marketing push for the game, and don't properly work and the car models vary widely in quality.
Almost every single enhancement Forza Horizon 5 brought has successfully been ignored, as evidenced by the old photo mode, barely functioning RT+Upscaling features, old car models and very bad sounds for a lot of the cars.

Adding to that, the progression in the career is controversial at best and a complete show-stopper at worst.

And all that while the game isn't nearly feature-complete at a price of 80€ or more?

I'm not even accounting for all the features lost. Stuff like a proper choice of body kits, proper visual damage, visually consequential upgrades, good engine sounds and MUCH more.

Don't even consider buying this game, like, ever. Not, if you're a Forza fan, not, if you're in desparate need of a new racing game. Just don't give them the light of day, for this pile of vile slideshow.
And, while others aren't exactly wrong about recommending FH5 instead, it's easy to see, where this game went wrong, because that game has its fair share of issues, as well, even though its launch has passed a while ago.

For this amount of money, you can easily buy a stack of very good older and indie games. There are so many good games you might have never heard about. ~15 fun experiences vs this waste of time and money. Or even better yet, spend that money on yourself. Your choice."

The core gameplay is excellent. The multiplayer is excellent. I just hope they can add longer races for career modes and multiplayer. They've added pitstop and tyre wear so I don't see a reason not to.

The game is very poorly optimized though, and it's not even THAT beautiful to give this much load to your GPU. Graphically it's just as good as ACC.

Overall what save this game is the driving and multiplayer."
forza+motorsport,Recommended,109.6,"Posted: October 13
tl;dr It's a great game, a lot of content, good (but not awesome driving physics), superb online multiplayer with some weaknesses and a lot of potential.

The long version.. First of all, to clarify the perspective from which I'm looking at this I've mostly played the older SMS games, Shift 2 and Project CARS (the first one) and recently got started on Assetto Corsa Competizione, so I'd call myself a semi-casual not-quite-simracer. I play with a Logitech G920 wheel exclusively, can't say anything to gamepad playability (but I'm hearing it's good). I'll try to break down my thoughts per category..

Physics / Driving
Initially, I noticed that the default force feedback settings didn't feel right, but I got that fixed after about 10minutes of googling, there's a lot of good settings out there. After getting initial setup out of the way, most cars drive in a believable way, feedback is okay, and I'd say the overall driving experience is on par with - if not slightly better than - the first Project CARS, but not as detailed and intuitive-feeling as ACC (which I think isn't a fair comparison). The main issues I noticed are
- little to no wheel feedback on curbs: Even though loading tires on curbs makes you lose traction quite easily, you don't feel much on the wheel when you're on curbs. I'd hope they improve that in a patch some day.
- Assists are missing a setting like ""realistic"", where you get exactly the assists the car has in the real world. As a lot of people have pointed out, driving GT3 cars without ABS and traction control (which they have IRL and aren't meant to be driven without) is pretty hard and doesn't feel sensible.

I'm in the second tour of the career by now and enjoy it so far. The car-point based progression system where you have to drive the car in order to earn points that you can invest into upgrades is something new and an idea I kinda like. You get to start with a stock car which handles like a tank that's just plain wrong on a racetrack (which I find totally realistic), and get to build it into something that can be competitive. What I do whenever I start on a new car is go to Rivals (the hot-lap leaderboard mode) and do a few laps in order to get a few car points to start off and at the same time learn tracks I don't know yet. Once you've got at least proper brakes and springs installed, the career races are fun and you can enjoy the further progress you make on the car. Yes, it does feel like a bit of a grind, but nowhere near as bad as a lot of people want to make you believe. Key is to use the car for more than just that single career championship - do some hotlaps with it, wait until there's an open series for that car class on featured multiplayer, and you'll get a lot ouf of the time you've invested in your build. However, the singleplayer career does have a few weaknesses so far:
- The race car classes are currently mostly missing from career. I do however expect them to get added over time - as of now, there's an upcoming ""featured"" LMP2 series. But since the featured series seem to be available for only a couple of weeks or so I'm curious as to where this goes and what permanent additions to career we get.
- Car progression isn't always logical: For example, you need a relatively high car level (11) to change the tire compound, which is an absolute gamechanger in terms of handling. I hope this gets a bit more balanced, maybe make the ""sport level"" compound already available at level 5.
- AI drivers: In short, the AI does give a credible imitation of a human driver in that it drives like an overconfident teenager. Getting rammed by AI cars is pretty frequent, they do tend to brake in totally unreasonable spots, etc. However, as far as I understood, the AI is based on machine-learning, so I fully expect that to improve the longer the game is live due to the larger training set they aquire (and I did get the impression it even got better in the time I've been playing). Also, it's not horrible most of the time, and it's kinda nice to see bots make human-seeming mistakes rather than just driving like they're glued to the ideal line.

Up until now, the only racing game I spent significant time in online multiplayer mode is ACC. Forza Motorsport doesn't reach the same level of clean racing, but isn't far behind. The race structure around practice, a short hotlap-based qualifying and short-to-medium length races is great. Doing a single ""race weekend"" takes somewhere from 30mins to an hour and is great fun. The rating system seems to work, I've been competitve (but far from the top of the pack) in most races I've done so far, with one podium and one win as the highlights. You have spec and open classes - in spec races, you have a specific car class (e.g. GT cars, racing hot hatches, etc.) and everyone gets a pre-tuned car for a mostly level playing field. In the open classes, you can bring your own build. Before you can enter any other multiplayer events, you have to finish the qualification tour, where you do 3 races in a racing version of a Honda Civic, which the game uses to determine your safety and skill rating. The multiplayer series vary on a weekly basis - some classes like Touring Cars and GT are always there, others are time-limited. I expect this way we'll be able to get a chance to use all those cars we built up in the career sooner or later when the right multiplayer series is there. The current Formual Mazda spec series is where I had some of the most thrilling races ever, and I really urge veryone to try the online mode of Forza Motorsport! However, there's still some room for improvement:
- The penalty system is a bit too forgiving right now: When someone rams me needlessly and costs me the race, I expect them to get a bit more than, say, a 4-second penalty added to their total race time - this should be more like a 30 second drive-through or sth. Once again, I think the penalties are machine-learning based, so I expect this to get better over time.
- Most races are relatively short. While that's nice if you don't have that much time, it would be nice to be able to do something where you need more than one pit stop and can do a bit more in terms of race strategy.

So far I've had loads of fun with what is already there. The developers did say they intend this to be a platform that grows over the years and gets improved on and, quite franky, there's enoguh room for that improvement. If you've ever played Assetto Corsa Competizione, you probably should stay away from the GT3 cars - but then, ACC is an exclusive hardcore GT3 sim, which FM never claimed to be, so we gotta stay fair. It's a game with hundreds of cars of vastly different character, and all I've driven so far were great fun (personal highlights are the fomula mazda and racing Golf GTI). It's definitely meant to be played online and I think you get the most out of it if you spend like 50% of the time on single- and multiplayer. If you don't wanna play online, I don't think what's left is worth the 70€. I think a lot depends on what content gets added over time and how Turn 10 irons out the few quirks tha game currently has, but I'm optimistic so far based on what I've seen."

ON ULTRA. Physics change when locked on 60fps likely for online.


this game looks like the dev time of 2 months not exaggerating. Wheres the day one patch??? Cmon downvote and get these people to show accountability, I paid 100 and i cant even access some of my extras. How much longer are we gonna say give them a chance, incomplete games is not the norm or an excuse. I hope you end this studio as well this is horrid and Microsoft is to blame."

Driving Physics
Despite being a car sim, driving physics in Forza Motorsport is the mid-point of casual arcade racing and car sim. With ample assistance options, even casual players can get the hang of it easily.
I am a new Motorsport player but have played Horizon for almost 1000 hours. With the same assistance setting, here are a few differences I observed.
Stock cars are predominantly understeering in Motorsport, no matter the different drivetrains.
Racetracks have set boundaries, and to avoid collision penalty, Motorsport requires a higher-level speed control. For example, controller players often pull the trigger for just a bit instead of bottom out for small acceleration or deceleration, which is rarely needed in Horizon.


Generally speaking, driving in Motorsport is harder than in Horizon, requiring higher skills in speed control and steering to follow the best driving line.
Physics feels more realistic, but the understeering stock car is questionable, as it seemingly contradicts the goal of realism. Driving different cars should feel different, no? In Horizon, FWD and AWD tend to be understeering and RWD oversteering, which seems to demonstrate the variety better than Motorsport.
Also, driving understeering cars is very uncomfortable, and though upgrades and tuning can improve considerably, players have to tolerate this unpleasantness for at least a short while, due to the progression system gatekeeping them at the start.

Marketing talked a lot about dynamic change in physics, which consists of outer and inner parts.


I think the game demonstrates outer change well, but not so much for inner change.
The effect of inner change has three options from no effect to high. As the high option also disables the very helpful rewind feature, I presume most people would pick the medium option, under which is hard to notice any inner changes.
There, I really think rewind should be separated from the effect for a better experience. It is always good to have options.
On a side note, collision penalty could be unreasonable before (rammer got no penalty but who got rammed received one). An update was supposed to address it, yet I still noticed some discrepancies.

As the last Motorsport was in 2017, Forza community has been playing Horizon 4 and 5 since, which is a sandbox experience that provides the basics to players to do whatever they want. They are designed not to gatekeep anything for maximum freedom and actively throwing out rewards for players to play with.
So, when everything needs grinding to unlock in the new Motorsport, there is a backlash. You could say the community is spoiled, but I don't think the backlash is uncalled for.

With the question of grind versus not grind, comes with the question of how much effort players need to grind.



Buying upgrades and cars use different currencies, fortunately. Car prices are not outrageous but collecting all definitely takes some grind. Because unlike the generous Horizon, Motorsport doesn’t like giveaway.

Besides, I don’t know what kind of save mechanic is using (doesn’t have Steam Cloud save), my progression just keeps rolling back triggered by infinite loading bug, crashes, or just exiting the game normally.
Hopefully, today's update can address it (no it did not), as I have already run some of the races six times.

For me, this game out of the box is a blurry mess with drastic frame drop. Major stutters occur when camera rotates (like when making big turns), causing motion-sick players to vomit (not sure if it is a joke). Graphics options are also bizarre and confusing.
Things improved after watching Digital Foundry graphics deep diving video, but if players have to watch a 30-minute video thesis to learn setting up graphics properly, you know the dev fxxked up royally.



Sound effects are indeed as great as marketing said, but the position can sometimes sound off like it comes out from the car behind instead of yours.

Menu design is important for Forza Motorsport as you either go through menus or run laps in this game, but I think menu design is not well thought out.

Core experience is mostly intact, yet it is obvious the developer cut some corners.




I still had fun playing this game, but it is not a satisfying experience.
I am probably being subjective, saying I am not a fan of the understeering, and I don’t approve of the grind and the progression system, but there is no excuse for horrendous performance, confusing graphics options, and releasing in such a bug-infested broken stage.
It is fine if you are on Game Pass, I just don’t think you should buy it at the current stage. Let’s see if the game gets better."

I hardly ever leave Steam reviews, but I think that it’s warranted on this one.

This game is the definition of “I’m not angry, I’m just disappointed.”

While I do believe they got the driving physics much better this time around, and the online does seem better as well, that’s right where my praise will end. I seriously cannot believe it took 6 years for this half-baked mess. I can barely run it at my native resolution (5120x1440) and get 60fps maxed out with a 13900k and a 6950xt. Excuse me for my ignorance as I am not a game developer and have a lot of respect for these folks, but I can’t imagine a track racer like Motorsport 8 should take up more system resources than Horizon 5, especially when it looks barely half as good. Seriously, I wouldn’t have a lot to complain about performance wise if it looked beautiful like other new titles releasing such as Baldur’s Gate 3, but this doesn’t even come close, and at times I’m not even sure if I’d call it good looking.

I’m not a huge fan of the constant crashing either. It has gotten bad enough that it’s a 50/50 shot if I’ll get through a race or not, with all the practice laps and everything in between. I genuinely would like to keep playing because the game does feel good to play, but at this point I guess I’ll just have to wait till they do some patches. Afterall, why should a product work as intended at launch? Go live service!

As far as the upgrade system goes, I like what they were trying to do, but this sucks. My best suggestion would be to bring down the car level cap from 50 to something like 20 or 30 and make sure that progress is transferred to any car of the same model. If you don’t wanna do that then just go back to using credits or something, it’s not rocket science. Just fix it.

Reader, do yourself a favor and save the hundred dollars you’d spend on the premium edition and go pick up a copy of Forza Motorsport 4 and a used Xbox 360. Not only will it probably be the same price, but you’ll have a better career mode, more tracks, more cars, better music, those great voice-overs from the old top gear crew, and no constant crashing. On top of that, you can invite your car buddies over to set lap times and play split screen, it makes for a great time.

Thanks for teaching me a lesson Forza, I’m finally done pre-ordering games.

It's a great racing experience when it 'works'. For now, don't bother playing Career mode with all these progression losing bugs and lockups.

This game really needs a few more months in the oven to fully cook, its very clear that the game is feature-incomplete and buggy. Drag/Drift mode isn't in the game despite already having all the needed parts.

Multiplayer on the other hand, its great (again when it works) Car homologation makes it a lot more competitive. Netcode very stable even in poor networking conditions, wheel to wheel racing is very much possible.

Car level progression still need more overhaul to make it less grindy, and remove the level-wall for upgrades, I don't mind having to grind for CP but don't limit my upgrade choices behind the levels. (also for the love of god, make the levels model based rather than a specific car)

Revisit this game again in early 2024 when they will probably fixed most of the issue and added more contents."

I could blabber on and on about the positive sides, like car physics simulation being incredible. The driving feeling is awesome. However none of this matter because the game lacks basically all core features.

There is effectively no multiplayer. There is effectively no rival racing. Why do I say that even if the features clearly exist in the game?

The reason is the car level system. If I want to do rivals on certain level or participate in multiplayer I must first race each and every car I might want to try around a track for about 2-3 hours to be able to actually tune them. This means the usual Forza process of try different cars and tune them might as well not exist, at least for me.

I went as far as grinded the levels on one car by just letting it autopilot around. But after that I just did not feel like playing anymore. Because I knew if it was not the best car for that track I'd need to let the computer to run 3 hours again just to try a second one.

As long as the car level system basically removes the possibility to experiment with the cars the review will stay as no recommendation. If it's removed then it'll be a glowing yes as one can once more compete in multiplayer on in rivals."

This review may be changed over the course of time depending on the actions Turn10 Studios will take. At 18-11-2023 I am posting this as a NEGATIVE review.

Right now, with the current state of the game and compared to olders titles all the way back to Forza Motorsport 2 when I started, this game is nowhere close to the quality of previous titles.

The Gameplay:
It's ""ok"" and still is Forza but there have been changes made that simply do not make any sense and frankly are just plain annoying after a short while. For example, you have to get ""Car XP"" for every single car you own. This means you have to unlock all the upgrades for every car over and over again. The annoying thing is that in the past you could just buy the upgrades depending on your driver level. Meaning that eventually you could just buy it all for all the vehicles. While I can understand you want a bit more progession to be involved, this aint it chief.

To make things worse, some core upgrades like tire compound are made so expensive that you often refrain from it for quite some time. This while tire compounds appear to have a major role in the game (which is actually nice).

The races are plain and simple, straight forward. But the AI is not so 'dynamic' and 'evolving' as they said it would be. It's actually very easy AI even on the most difficult setting despite me being an average player at best. Now the AI has a few 'modes' while racing them. 1. RACING LINE OR BUST. They will ram you as much as they can to get you off the track. 2. You got the corner? I AM OFF TO NARNIA! Yeah the AI just divebombs into the gravel/grass or even the wall without being close to them simply because you had the racing line on the corner. 3. I'M JUST ENJOYING THE RIDE! Meaning, they just cruise around slowly.... They are not going for the best possible times they can get.

Now onto the driving itself..... and yeah.... CARS ARE NOT ON ICESKATES.
Some cars tend to just feel like you're driving on ice. This get's A LOT WORSE WHEN USING A WHEEL. I've made many laps in several vehicles on both controller and my G920 and I couldn't help but notice that when using a wheel there is simply no grip at all. Even if you mimic the input to your controller, the car just refuses to steer and starts gliding off the track like you're driving on ice. ""Git gud"" many said at the start but now most of us agree, wheel setups don't work right now.

FFB is BROKEN. When it works it's nice, but after a few laps it tends to just shutdown and randomly reappear again.

Graphics and Sound:
As many said, graphics are a mile off. While I've had some tracks that looked quite good and with some weather events involved even quite beautifull, this is a rare instance. I would say that Forza Motorsport 3 looks better in quite some ways than some tracks and, unfortunately, cars look.

Sound overall decent but not that great. I did notice that on some car classes the brakes sound like a nitrous injection which is just weird.

Performance:
Shambles, it's not optimized at all and framerate can dip in low 40s for me in Ultra while the graphics themselves are nowhere near other games that run so much better. (I7 13700k, 32GB RAM @ 4200, RTX 3080 installed on M.2 NVME, RES: 3440x1440) RTX is not noticeable at all so rather just disable that. DLSS seems not to do anything and as mentioned, the game doesn't even look that good. If I were to boot up Project Cars, Assetto Corsa Competitione or heck even Forza Horizon 5 they just look so much better. Note: Forza Horizon 5 works like a dream and looks a lot better, I don't get how to got it so wrong here.

Multiplayer: Is a lot of fun. Best part so far especially thanks to the safety ratings. However, the penalty system needs work as players who tend to charge in like the Hulk get no pentalties but their victims do. Unfortunately this happened to me once so far.

Content:
Drip feeding content but also straight up lacking loads of content. Forza 7 has disappeared but we lack tracks and cars. So many inconic tracks that have always been in the titles are now missing or being released much later on (like Nordschleife).

I can't understand why this game lacks so much.


Overall: Like Gran Turismo 7 that has been out for 2 years now. This game needs work and after all that work it hopefully will be fine. But right now I just cannot recommend the game despite loving the Forza Motorsport series. This game made me step into Gran Turisme 7 as I never owned any of those titles before."

Just wrapped up several hours on the new Forza Motorsport, and I have some feedback for my fellow Steam racers. First up, let’s talk positives: the visual department is stellar. The ray tracing on PC paints each scene beautifully, and those cars? Detailed to the bolt, making it evident that the artists were at the top of their game. The sound design deserves a shout-out too; cars sound authentic and truly immerse you in the driving experience.

Now, on the gameplay side, the physics overhaul is fantastic. Handling feels much more responsive and nuanced, especially when playing with a controller. The driving experience is, without a doubt, a high point of this game.

But it's not all sunshine and revved engines. After a six-year hiatus, there were some high expectations. At times, the game's visuals can feel slightly cartoonish, a bit of a contrast from the otherwise hyper-realistic feel. Customization is where I felt a sting. Tow hooks and a basic spoiler? That’s surface-level for a game of this caliber. We loved features like launch control in Horizon 5; their absence here is puzzling. And devs, a small plea: Horizon 5 recognized that some of us metric system users cherish HP over KW. Can we get that back, please?

All said and done, Forza Motorsport does deliver in many areas, and I'll undeniably clock in countless hours. However, it’s a tad disappointing. Honestly, it doesn't quite align with what I had envisioned. Browsing through online discussions, it appears I’m not alone in this sentiment. For a game in development for six years, it surprisingly lacks groundbreaking features or noteworthy additions. We were all gearing up for a title that was meant to define next-gen racing, but it seems to fall short in that regard. It doesn't truly feel like the culmination of a six-year development cycle. Still, here's hoping the devs pick up on the feedback and steer future updates in the right direction."

terribly optimized. 1080p res running at around 25-40 fps on a 3070 and with rtx on it goes down to 10-16 fps with stutters, dlss doesnt even work (atleast for me). on fh5 i can play maxed out at 1440p with 70~ fps

some cars also have absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ detail. an example is the cr s2k, the digital dash looks like it was made by a 5 year old / looks like it came straight out of a low quality mobile game

update: this game also has a bug where it sometimes infinitely loads after you apply an upgrade / buy a new car which forces you to alt f4, losing your career data :) nice game turn 10"

Recommended for people who like FH5 and want to have a clean online multiplayer racing experience.

Not recommended if you like ACC, AC, or Iracing as this is still a simcade game more than real sim racing. While they claim to have laser scanned the tracks, I find the way their models appear to have dumb down the tracks to make them easier to drive, so it is nowhere near as accurate. For Wheel users, be prepare to spend time playing with the settings as the out of box setting are clearly inferior to FH5. The good news is with effort, they can be ok. But if you have a good DD wheel, you will quickly realize how inferior the FFB is compared to ACC, AC, or Iracing.

Now as far as fun factor is concern, I think FH5 is far superior with far more different types of racing, better AI racing, graphics, and rewards system, so FM only real advantage is the safety rating system that does help make multiplayer racing clearner than the crashfest FH5 and hence why I do recommend it for that use case.

But otherwise I would say play a real sim racing game or save you money and stick to FH5."

Sooo, a new Forza Motorsports title. It's been a while.

Is it good? Yes, very, but with some caveats.

The physics and driving model are excellent, hugely more nuanced than FH5 and FM7. With simsteering even on a controller you know what is going on. I think the best compliment I can give is that it is just fun and enjoyable to drive in this game.
The changes to multiplayer are top tier imo. The safety and driver system works. The practice, qualifying and racing is an excellent step in the right direction. The racing is now superb for the most part. Yes, we have lost the various hoppers where you can jump into a race. Personally, I don't really care that it is gone. It always ended up being bumper cars regardless.

I enjoy the car progression system, especially from a career aspect. You start out with a bone stock car, and at the end of the 5-6 race championship, you can potentially end up with a very nicely tuned and competitive vehicle that you can use for other things. Outside of the career mode, the progression system is pretty bad and needs some major work. There are also some design decisions which are just a bit annoying and some of the good improvements that FH5 made are not present such as wheel spacers being a big one. Oh, and the menu lighting needs a lot of work because at the moment it is baaad.

Still, this game is solid and enjoyable, and I have no doubt it will continue to improve as QoL and other updates come through. We have 2 tracks and loads of new cars to look forward to before the end of the year. Remember lads, FM7 was super crappy on launch but improved over time. This will be the same, just need to be patient."

I buy my favorite car, I go to race it, I can't because it starts in D class and there's no D class multiplayer. Hey this is Forza, I can just upgrade it and go race no problem.

Except I can't, because my car is level 0 and I don't have any upgrades available because I haven't raced it. But I can't race it, because there's no races for D class.

My only option is to grind it out against bots for hours (whose driving standards make ""random guy in a Forza lobby"" look like a saint), then repeat that process over and over again for every single car I buy.

I bought this game to race, not grind, and I regret it."

it hurts to leave a bad review for this game, as i genuinely love the entire forza franchise.
but it also hurt to play, so ill allow myself to.

first of all, get this game on series x if you really want to play it. the pc version does not run well at all. i can barely get it to run well on medium settings with dlss enabled, and my pc is not bad.
second of all, and thisll be a bit harder to fix, is the overall game itself. whoever thought the new progression system for upgrading cars was a good idea is just wrong. i do not want to have to play several hours to unlock all upgrades on ONE CAR. if it was a manufacturer level thing, that wouldve already been better. but having to individually level up each of the ~500 cars (which, the roster is lacking aswell, but i really do not want to get into that right now) is just insane to me.
the campaign is not all that fun either, youll definitely get the most out of this game in free play or multiplayer.
one positive thing i can give the game atleast is that cars feel fun to drive. even though the fuel and tire simulation is completely broken for me.

all in all, i just cant recommend the game in its current state. i hope eventually they will somehow fix all the problems with it."

Exhilarating would be the word if this was a one word review. As a blind gamer i had given up on ever playing a game of this nature again. There are an absolute raft of accessibility options available for me and the blind driver mode set up was a breeze.
Into the races and at first I crashed the car ..... A lot. I was slowly getting the hang of it and managed to complete the two intro races, no lap records though.
It is tremendous the amount of work that has been put in to ensure I can finish not only a lap but a whole race. I will never be the quickest but with practice will hopefully be competent.
Text to speech is there along with audio description but that is just the start with the sounds in race highlighting where on the track you are and commentary highlighting what is coming up.
This game gives me hope for the future, as long as more studios put in the effort."

My opinion after initial 20 hours playing the game:

Positive and great things:

- Best driving in any Forza Motorsport ever, far superior than previous one and much more closer to a serious simracer. Great in track feelings (I play on wheel only).
- Great FFB even with my humble G29, I’ve just increased and touched some settings as it was a bit bland by default.
- Visually speaking I love how it looks and the realistic lighting, even that the PC version is totally mess in settings and performance.
- The level of detail in every circuit is astonishing and far superior to any other racing game IMHO.
- Track dynamics feel great
- Featured online is AWESOME!! Finally we got serious racing including pit strategy, tyre compound and practice+qualyfing sessions. Best game mode in any Forza ever. Please even if you add custom lobbies, keep these as they are now.
- Time attack and rivals mode are great especially with the great driving physics.

Mixed bag things:

- Progression system feels artificial and a barrier to simply put more hours in the game. I dont mind to put 3 hours on rivals to level up a car and custom it the way I like it, but I understand that people complain about it.
- Sound effects sometimes are great but there is some flaws aswell like the VTEC Honda engines that sounds terrible.
- Penalty system should be more strict, even that for the launch it is decent, I expected something worse. Better than FM7 FRR

Negative things and issues that have to be fixe ASAP:

- AI is just terrible. No competition feeling anywhere, they don’t know even how to drive close and quick to another car.

- 60fps cap multiplayer is like an insult for PC players

- Replay system is dreadful. we cannot see even in which lap the replay is going on, no timeline, no options, nothing. And multiplayer replays are bugged and I cannot reproduce them

- Always online game is something definitely bad

- It’s buggy and it looks like there has been no testing period in lots of minor(and some major) things

- Recycled Xbox360 models: E30, E92, Golf II, Sivia, etc.

- Lack of assists granularity, on TC, ABS, this should be possible specially on GT cars

- Missing auction house, it’s like a mini-game that provides great fun

- It is TERRIBLE that we cannot select Km/h and hp as measure units, in Europe we use that!!! I don’t know what means the power of a car in KW. This is possible in Forza Horizon since long time ago and it is just lazyness from T10

- Where are the STATISTICS? Races played, podiums, pole positions, distances covered in total and by car, safety and skill ratings improvement or decreased after every ranked race… there is nothing!!!

I miss a roadmap from T10 apart from we’re gonna deliver this track in this date, we need to know which are the features they are working on and which are the plans in the short term for the game

As a recap, great game, probably BEST FM EVER even with its flaws, please Fix the PC version performance and settings!!"

TLDR:

Game drives amazingly, and the racing online can be truly superb, but you'd better be content with that. This game offers nothing else, and takes far more than it gives. We've undoubtedly regressed since the last motorsport game. The car leveling is ""artificialplaytimeenhancer.exe"" and there's not a single good reason it exists, especially not in it's current state. If you want a game to take street cars and make them race cars, like Forza has always been, don't buy this, go play FH5 instead it's way better for that. This game isn't for that anymore apparently, and Turn10 made that painfully clear. If all you care about is driving race cars on race tracks, still don't get it because this game is indisputably, objectively bad. Go get ACC, or AC, or PC2, or literally any other racing game/sim. You'll have more fun, and you can mod those too which automatically makes them better. This game doesn't feel like Forza. It doesn't feel like anything for that matter. We gained the best physics Forza has ever seen, but we lost what Forza has always been in the process. I wish I only played for 2 hours so I could return it. Don't buy this game.


The Good Stuff:

Best driving Forza to date w/out a doubt, the multiplayer feels great w/ featured races where everyone is in the same car, or at least the same kind of car (Touring Cars, GT3 cars, Street Cars etc.). Forza finally feels right on a wheel (albeit w/ a lot of settings adjustments) and the track list is *good enough*, we know they plan on adding more later so that'll get better too. A good amount of true race cars in the game, including a lot of the silhouette cars from the 80s which is sick, honestly. The physics are fantastic, never been better in a Forza title. They nailed this part. I'm not sure how much more there is to say here sadly. Onto the bad now...

The ""WTF Was Turn10 Thinking"" Stuff:

Removed hundred of cars from the previous motorsport game, and we lost improvements made in FH5 for some reason. Locked framerate in multiplayer races sounds nice, but the game runs so incredibly poorly that there's no such thing as a stable framerate. I fluctuate between 100fps, and 41fps, with seemingly no consistency in either direction (all on the same track for the record). The game is riddled w/ bugs, crashes constantly and has unbelievably poor performance, even on the lowest settings. Remember the improved photo mode in FH5 that everyone was so excited for? Well that isn't here for some reason either so we're back to the stone ages of photography for this one.

We lost a bunch of cars from the old game, but they promise that a lot of them, ""didn't make sense for motorsport"". I already see a number of full fledged race cars missing from the last game so I'd say that's not entirely true. The S15 still hasn't been updated. Sorry S chassis gang, no luck here. Most cars are still re-used ♥♥♥♥♥♥ assets from 1956 when FH1 came out so don't expect your 350z to finally start looking nice in Forza.

The AI are fast, as long as they're ahead of you, and not around anyone else. The second you pass them they seem to just give up and slow down massively, and they still can't drive in a pack w/out randomly slamming on the brakes. They randomly drive off the circuit and just crash into the barrier, not sure what that's about. In fairness, it does make it feel more like a typical online lobby in Forza so maybe that was the goal.

The career mode ""builders cup"" where you're supposed to care about the car you choose, and what upgrade go with it is complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ b/c.They toss you into so many different categories and none of the cars cross over, so you never end up using the same car for more than 5 races or so. This completely removes the point of the leveling system which was supposed to work in tandem w/ the career mode. Boneheaded decision to say the least. Oh, it also features no actual race cars, so everything you drive will handle like a bus until you get to level 8 and get real suspension.

The car ""leveling"" (if you can even call it that, seriously wtf) is atrocious. I mean seriously, it's ""Noah, get the boat"" bad. If you want to take a Hakosuka Skyline from the 70s and go upgrade it with an RB26 and the AWD out of the R34, well I don't even know if you can do that, because just leveling the car enough to get to that point, will take you about 5 hours. 5 HOURS. I don't want to drive a car on 50 year old suspension and tires for 5 hours straight. Who would? I wouldn't have so many problems w/ the leveling system if it at least made some sort of sense. Okay, we're taking an old car from the 70s and we want to take it racing. What are the first things you'd think to do? Wheels/Tires, Weight Reduction, Suspension and Brakes right? Because you don't race a car on 50 year old tires, brakes and suspension. Weight reduction is a no brainer b/c that ♥♥♥♥ is free so always weight reduction. Well if you want tires, you'll have to wait until ""Car Level"" 11 for that. Okay, well how about weight reduction at least then, we can reduce the load of our old ass tires at least. That's level 20. Well ♥♥♥♥, surely suspension will at least unlock from the start, right? That's level 8. You can get new brakes right away though! Brakes that completely outmatch your tires and make them effectively not an upgrade at all because your tires are still so bad, that your braking distance may as well not change at all. Wheels, and tire width come at level 2 which is also just so boneheaded. Why are those not unlocked from the start? Why is this system here at all? With the current leveling system, the ""logical upgrade path"" makes no sense at all. You get the stuff race cars actually need so incredibly late compared to just throwing more horsepower at the problem that it's not even funny. Makes any older car complete ♥♥♥♥ to deal with since it handles so poorly for so long.

The online is buggy as hell, and the penalty system is completely unhinged. I got penalties for getting rammed off the track and thrown into a wall. You can cut a corner by a car width and not get a penalty one lap, but the next lap going one pixel over the limit is a .8 second penalty for some reason. It's inconsistent, and non functional in grand scheme of things. Just the penalty system needs so much work that I doubt it'll ever get addressed by Turn10. They don't exactly have a history of giving a ♥♥♥♥ about what their players want, so don't hold your breath.

The car pass included less than ever, and the base game is now $70 even though they ripped basically every model except the 22B from old games. How does this make sense? They did less work, and we paid more money. Not how this ♥♥♥♥ is supposed to go.

Trailer shows cars that aren't even in the game at this moment in time, basically guaranteeing some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ DLC down the road that even the Premium Edition users will have to pay extra for.

Paint get's super de-saturated whenever it's darkened for some weird reason, and multiple sets of wheels refuse to be painted, and will remain their base color, but be slightly tinted to the color you selected. How does this even get through testing? Did anyone test this? Test your game ffs.

Wow. That was a lot for me. I'm exhausted now.

I'm more upset than I thought I was with this game. We waited for years on years, for a new motorsport game and this is what we get. I was so excited, I was so ready to stop driving around Mexico in FH5 and finally get back to a real race track, in a real race car. I guess I got my wish, but I lost everything else Forza stood for in the process. RIP Motorsport."

It's fun. Feels like a middle area of sim and arcade racers. I'm not sure if the negative reviews about the game not being playable is from crap hardware but my laptop plays it fine with a gtx1070 and a 3rd gen i7 at low 50s fps. Which isn't really terrible considering it shouldn't even be able to play the game.

Car count and selection is really good, tuning seems a little arcadish, AI seems to randomly dart at you or just slam on the brakes sometimes."

Way too many glitches/technical issues/oversights from major to minor for a AAA $100 game.

Tracks LITERALLY DISAPPEAR mid-race and leave you racing in the void for the remainder of the event, FPS cuts exactly in half at random and requires you to pause/unpause to fix, replay system typically has cars flying in midair. Headlights often don't appear in cutscenes/replays. The rear view mirror is a completely different low-quality world that's often missing assets like trees and grandstands. Menus don't stretch to 21:9 screens.

The racing wheel support is a joke, when that should be a focus of a sim racing game. Enabling the clutch causes a neutral drop every rolling start/every shift that's a bit too quick, and isn't actually needed at all to shift. The wheel settings are all sorts of whacked out by default and require you to watch a Youtube tutorial to get within reason.

There's no Auction House. You can't adjust the camera position in cockpit view. You can't change race length in career mode (every single race is a sub 10 minute sprint that requires no tire changes/refueling). Nordschliefe (which is in basically every Motorsport game) is also missing, only has the GP circuit.

A lot of the car models/liveries are re-used from prior games, complete with low poly models and pixelated liveries. Rims/wheels turn into a static picture at a certain speed, it's very obvious and looks silly. The black paint color isn't actually black, it's dark grey.

There's also strange balancing issues, like opponents upgrading their cars between races and forcing you to upgrade after every round to have any chance at all of winning, not starting with wet tires if it's raining, and penalties not always removing if you re-wind to avoid them.

I'm sure they'll get around to fixing all this eventually, but it's pretty hard to recommend as it stands."

Don't look at trailers - it's a lie.
I was a loyal forza fan since FM2 and new FM is a death note for the series.

Graphics is broken:
- stutters no matter what settings are
- fps drops in half after race or two or after changing random settings even not graphical
- black levels are mess, you can't see details in the dark parts of the image
- textures are soft and trailers don't represent it's quality
- grass textures are disgusting and out of focus, AC grass looks MILES better and it's a 9 yo game
- skies are literally from FM7 and there is a bug that makes them out of focus too
- before update 2 there was a problem with pixelated contours of cars and after update 2 fine details are gone
you can't see grills on cars!!!
- road reflections in the rain conditions are broken and go away while wipers are moving
- car's rims are replaced with 2d flat textures while moving on certain speed
- headlights are dull and you can't see far away at night races

MP doesn't work correctly:
- matchmaking doesn't work and lobbies full of rammers
- MP replays doesn't save so you can't see it or report a rammer
- constant disconnects at different points of the race (worst is to play 20 minutes of practice and end up disconnected on the start of the race)
- poor connection even when it's not

AI is broken:
- rams you all the time
- can't race you
- goes miles in front of you and if you pass them they drive much slower and can't overtake you properly
- can't be used in custom MP

Penalty system works strange:
- people often don't get panalties for ramming you on purpose if they push the breaks before the ram or for some other reason
- many times if you rammed by someone you can get penalty
- if someone spins in front of you and you hit them because you can't avoid it you can get penalty as a rammer
- sometime if you go off track slightly you can get 10 sec penalty

Devs should apologize and fix all the bugs that shouldn't be on release. They should get the game to the level of trailers in all aspects of the game. Then and only then they can modestly hope that players will trust them again.
I know I still can get a refund because of the game state and I didn't do that only because I love forza series and I'm giving devs a chance to save their face. It's the last time I'm doing that."

Absolute pile of expletive. I am max skill rating in multiplayer, safety rating S. Game is populated by people who should be playing Mario Kart. Game crashes so much it would be impossible for the average person to give any sort of decent feedback without considering it a full time job. To practice for *30* minutes for a 9 minute race only for said race to crash in intermission before it even starts is asinine. I'd love to hear a response from Turn10 to this, but I won't.


Edit: They released a new update claiming a bunch of fixes but nothing changed. In fact, it seems to be more buggy than before the update."

I actually thoroughly enjoy the game. Generally the ""Motorsports"" line of Forza does not keep my interest as I tend to side more on the open world aspect of Horizon, but I have been longing for a competitive racing game again and this has scratched the itch.

I have barely played any Single Player in Forza so far, I feel it just is boring racing ""AI"" that aren't all that intelligent. If you're looking for a racing game strictly for Single Player, I can't really recommend it.

But, Multiplayer has been super competitive (For me). I currently sit at a Safety Score of S and a Skill Rating of 4900 and find the competition to actually want to race, and not ram you. Yes, there are people in the game who try to just ruin your race and it has happened to me, and it is frustrating, but when you look past it and get into lobbies with legit players, the game is rewarding."

-but you cant skip the parts where they would be talking
-there is only ONE audio clip for crashes or bumps. no matter who or what you hit or how fast, always the same donk
-car and engine sounds are a mixed bag, some are good even great but most are just bad
-same driver ai again. you dont race with a 20 car grid it's just a 1v1 with the ai in first place. 3rd cant keep up and just leads a train of cars
-so many, long loading screens ... and i played starfield but this is somehow worse
-menus dont loop anymore. what i mea: when you are on the left most page you cant jump to the last page by going to the left. you have to go through all pages left to right.

but for me the most surprising or shocking part are the visuals, lod drops after 100meters, reflections are 144p, edges are everything but sharp, weird glitches with shadows."

Pros:
Multiplayer is improved with the addition of skill rating and safety rating (how likely you are to crash into others)
They remodeled the Subaru 22B
Sim wheel usage has improved. stock settings kinda suck, but with some adjustments it's much better than previous forza games.

Cons:
Poorly optimized for PC. 12700k + 3070ti can't run ultimate graphics at 1080p.
Bad car upgrade progression. Grinding for ""car points"" to upgrade your car is extremely annoying and boring. (they released an update that made it less grindy than it was before, but it's still bad.)
Uninspired car list. Very few cars are actually interesting.
Boring single player. None of the single player even uses the race cars, all of them are normal cars, also no edurance races, or any races you even need to worry about fuel/tires. AI is either cheating levels faster than you or not even a competition.
Bad graphics. Downgrade from FH5. Weird texture issues. Bad shaders. (read update below)
Many 10+ year old models are used. just recycled from FM1,2,3,4 without any improvements. Several cars are still very inaccurate to their real life versions. S15 Silvia is a perfect example of this.
Physics are garbage. Understeer simulator 2023. I have bruised my fingers using controller because it just feels like the controller isn't responding rather than like understeer physics, so i end up pressing very hard on the controller buttons. (this is mostly due to the sense of speed being very bad, so it feels like you're going slower than a car would normally be able to handle a corner, but if you look at your actual speed, it's decently reasonable.)
Bad track list. Didn't even come with Nurburgring Nordschleife
Shortest list of Car Pass DLC cars of any Forza game
Huge list of bugs and issues
No wheel offset option even though FH5 had it
No drift modes (online or offline)
Has drift suspension but no drift tires

Notes:
It seems like they are heavily setting this game up for post release content. How much of that will be free vs paid is yet to be seen.
I bought the $100 ultimate version and I have deep regret for doing that.
I'll likely still keep playing the game despite how bad it is just because there isn't really any other semi-sim racing games that I can play on controller and be casual with.
I really hope that post release game updates fix all the issues that the community has.

(Update): Graphic Notes:
Higher render scale looks better than any of the other settings. I've been running 150% render scale on high preset and it looks A LOT better.
8GB if vram isn't enough for ""Ultra"" textures (even at 1080p and 100% render scale). There is glitches were if you run out of vram, textures just don't load (like track textures, so looks like you're driving on nothing).
High textures look really good though, didn't notice a different at 1080p to be honest, and the game uses a bit over 7GB of vram at that setting.

Final Verdict:
Don't pay for this game unless you're purely looking for a casual semi-sim online racing experience.
Game was cracked on day one. Until they fix all the massive issues this game has, I highly suggest you save your money for other things."

Demolition Derby. This game will never be on a sim racing level because yolo xbx enjoyers play it for free like it's a new Forza Horizon. You will enjoy it if you like to ruin other people's races - just do it, go kick someone from P1 to P20 like a torpedo - you'll have only 2seconds penalty at worst. You literally can start P20 and dive on first turn smashing everyone around you and be a P3 after first turn with only 2.25 seconds penalty.

And of course, enjoy 60FPS gaming because you have to be on the same level with Andy who play game for free on his 200$ console."

It's a scam,
it doesn't look like the trailers at all...
it forgets to reapply your input settings (have to change them every time I enter the game)...
it has different binding depending if you are in the main menu or in career (the confirm button and the cancel button change)..
it doesn't have so much content in career mode...
it runs at 38fps with a 4090 (4k ultra).. i brought it to 56 on medium/high...
Lots of frame drops, half of the cinematics stutter...
Every time you enter a tournament and you didn't yet finish the first race it make you watch an unskippable cinematic that doesn't even say anything interesting most of the times.

It'd be fine for a 20-40 bucks game, not double that amount..."

I love Forza. I've been around since Forza Motorsport 4 and Forza Horizon 2. I've played all the games up until this point except for the full versions of Forza Motorsport 7 and Forza Horizon 4. I did play the demos, though. After all of that, I was hoping to finally be able to play a motorsport game on PC. However, I'm severely disappointed with this game. Please do not buy this.
For me, the biggest problems with this game are the severe lack of content and the way progression works.

Content:
There's only a handful of tracks in the game and a few variations of each. The tracks look good and play nice, but there is just so few. The car list is fine, with quite a few returning cars but also a lot that are absent. I assume Turn 10 intends to add some of the others later as DLC. I just don't feel like this is worth 70 dollars. Dozens of games have come out before this with more content for a cheaper price.

Progression:
Progression is terrible and doesn't make sense for a Forza game. Who wants to drive the same car in circles for 8 hours to unlock one upgrade for it? On top of that, I dislike the points system for upgrading the cars. Instead of spending the in-game currency to upgrade, you have to spend points to upgrade. The game will tell you no if you don't have enough points to install an upgrade you've already unlocked. You have to level up every single new car you purchase before you can start putting upgrades on it. This is not fun, AT ALL. We're not researching a tech tree. We're buying and upgrading cars because we want to drive and race them. Imagine wanting to race a friend in a specific car, but it turns out they don't own the car or the upgrades for it, so you either have to race it stock with them or make them level it up for hours on end. Who thought this was a good idea?

Graphics/Optimization:
The game doesn't look the best at certain times. I run the game on max settings and some things just look like they were from a game that came out 10+ years ago. I think it mostly has to do with odd ways the game may light certain scenes. On top of this, the game doesn't run very well. It's certainly playable at max settings, but I get frame drops from time to time. I do have a 3090, 11th gen i9, 64GB of RAM, and an SSD, though.

The Good:
There's only a few things I like about the game right now. It is probably, by far, the best racing game on PC for driving with a controller (with pretty much all the assists off). Another thing I like is being able to completely change the event I'm doing while I'm in the event, so I don't have to sit through 2 loading screens to back out and load back in if I want to change something. Pretty much everything else is either subpar or satisfactory.

Conclusion:
Please, don't buy this game in its current state. After 6+ years of wait, this game is not finished and shouldn't be listed as such. I'd prefer people to put the pressure on Turn 10 and Microsoft to actually finish the game, if that's what they ever intended to do in the first place. ""Live content"" killed Halo and it'll probably kill Forza too. Please stop releasing unfinished games."

Year after year, EA, despite being one of the highest grossing video game company of all-time, you fail to actually deliver a product on release day that is reflective of its price. People are paying a premium for your games every year, and are met with some of the most lacklustre, mundane and boring features every year. Sure, you can blame us for continuing to buy the game, but the truth is, I love football. You love football. And FIFA/EA Sports FC is the only game out there that can scratch that itch. There are no viable competitors. Therefore, through our love for the beautiful game that is football, we keep buying it. And you know that, EA. That is why you refuse to actually do some hard coding in your game and add new features/improve the game.

You are too busy milking all the 12-year old FUTwhales that spend mum and dad's money on your stupid packs, which is all that ultimately matters to you in the end. You do not care that Career Mode has not been proper innovated since the dawn of Jesus Christ, or that Pro Clubs has so much untapped potential. All that matters to you, is FUT, and the whales that keep splashing thousands upon thousands every year, only for all of their players, items, to be obsolete the following iteration of FIFA/EAFC.

I would also like to point out that, despite us paying the same amount, the level of disrespect you have continuously shown us PC players is unforgivable. Not just this year, but every other year. Do not think we have forgot about the absolute disaster of a release that was FIFA 21, FIFA 22 and FIFA 23. If you are lucky enough to even launch the game, you are most likely met with terrible FPS, choppy animations, bugged out player models, and honestly, the list is endless if I wanted it to be. Speaking of lists, I am going to provide one with all of the bugs that I encountered in my first few hours of game-play.

→ Choppy animations, frames drop and becomes an eye-sore to watch.
→ Commentary does not work on launch. There is 0 commentary.
→ Player models, the hair, bugs out when it is rainy and foggy. Becomes pixelated.
→ Can not connect to the internet (whatever this means).
→ Controllers not working properly.
→ Game keeps minimising on PC.
→ The game is not opening and launching for so many players.
→ Can not sack coaches in Career Mode, it just freezes.
→ Objectives not counting.
→ Not getting XP when completing objectives.
→ The game freezes on the EA FC logo.
→ Stuck in half-time animation.
→ Game-play stutter.
→ Overall TERRIBLE performance even on high-end hardware.
→ Anti-cheat error message.
→ Media questions still make 0 sense.
→ Same animations for media interviews and transfers.
→ Same animations for injuries, etc. 0 innovation and creativity here.
→ Menu in FUT will freeze and you have to close the game and launch it again.
→ If you navigate the menu too quickly, it messes up and goes all over your screen.

Again, like mentioned, this list could be as long as you want it to be. The point is, you are incompetent EA, and you are ESPECIALLY incompetent when it comes to creating a proper PC port. But of course, because you know we love football and we simply have no other alternatives, you can keep getting away with this. I am an idiot for playing this game and ""enabling it"" and I know I am, but that is not going to stop me from speaking out about the disgrace of a company you run.

Also, why on Earth would you remove players walking out onto the pitch and lining up before a game? What went on in your heads over there at EA when you thought, hmm, let us replace this key part of immersion building and realism and replace it with a few stupid cutscenes then immediately throw you into the game where everyone is already on the pitch ready to go. What about Champions League nights, important finals, etc? There is no immersion anymore. You do not get to watch your team walk out, line up, with the anthem roaring in the background, your players lined up and ready to battle it out... it just sends you straight into action. This is SO stupid. As a Career Mode enjoyer (shock, I know right, cause who still willingly plays this neglected mode?) this totally kills off getting any sort of feeling towards your games, especially big ones. Mind-boggling decision. Begs the question, in typical EA fashion, which iteration of EA FC will you bring this back and market it as a ""brand new, immersive feature""?"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------New Update
after more than 200 hours timeplay here is my review for the gameplay
tbh purble place is a better game than fc24 this game is awful
do you want to win? 71 depth - 5 at back - cutbacks - direct passing - and There you go! you have anything that you need to win now its up to you
how this game works??? its more like rocket league the ball just gonna bounce 1284 times until you concede a goal like bounce bounce bounce bounce bounce bounce finesse shot and yep thats a goal there is no point in defending the ball just gonna bounce back to your opponent
your cdms are man marked by strikers (Yes your cdms are man marked by strikers and the rest of your players too !!!!!!!)
90 minutes pressure without lossing stamina and the only option that you have is to make a long pass from your lb to your rb or from your rb to your lb and then you have to wait for your opponent to make a mistake so you can make a move and create yourself a chance to score
for those whos gonna defend this company and say skill issue let me tell you something
there is no skill issue cause this game doesnt require skill anymore
its all about being a rat and have some luck
do yourself a favor and stay away of this awful thing ( im not gonna call this thing a game anymore cause its not this thing is not fun or entertaining like it supposed to be)"

Having played FIFA titles competitively and consistently throughout the last 5-6 years, I can safely say without a doubt that this is the most horrific title ever released. This may seem like an overreaction (after all, how bad can a reskinned football game be right?!), and I wish it was, but it isn't in the slightest. I will break this down into some broad sections:

Gameplay:
Where do you start with this. It appears that, for what feels like the third time in a row in FIFA/FC franchises, that the AI is only capable of playing at a high level using high depth, direct passing tactics, that completely negate any form of tactical flexibility or stylistic influence you may wish to have (this may be my FM brain kicking in, but im sure most people dont ALWAYS want to play the same 90 minutes over and over again?). Having been in the elite divisions and consistently finishing FUT champs at around 16-4, I have not seen any variation, besides the starting formation to revert to the standard 4321 meta.

With the new Evolution system being introduced, I, like many fans, were excited to see what layer of tactical flexibility this could offer to teams in ultimate team. Unfortunately, this feature is SEVERELY disappointing. In classic monopolistic style micro-transaction paradise, more 'premium' upgrades are locked behind what seems to be a ridiculously steep paywall (I am of the opinion that paying upwards of £15 for a single player upgrade is quite frankly outrageous). Furthermore, the restrictions are so draconian that only a select crop of players can be eligible. Take the 'Centurions Midfielder' upgrade, with an increased price of 150k coins (don't try to calculate how many games you would need to play) or 2k fifa points. The ONLY usable player in this selection that would be considered meta is Marcos Llorente (shocker!), and any other would be a waste of hard earned currency/ies. Like most years, the availability of exclusive players is so unbelievably high that you would have to wait until AT LEAST post Xmas for any hope of obtaining top level cards (and that is generous, since i'm basing this off of my experience in previous titles, having playing EVERY weekend league with consistent rewards). Would you like to use your favourite footballer, Kylian Mbappe? That is a shame, since you would need a literal mortgage on fifa points to afford just his services (lets not even get into top tier icon prices!!).

Remarkably, even due to the 'new' engine that was blessed to us two years ago on PC versions, the level of AI stupidity is quite frankly remarkable. Positional play is non-existent to be optimistic, and downright outrageous on the other end of the spectrum. Realistically, the only avenue of scoring is (you guessed it) Step 1: Buy fast wingers with playstyle+s that offer more 'pace' than their stats suggest (Chiesa is a good example), to then cut it back on a plate. There is no variation at the top level of the game, as this is the most achievable way of scoring a goal. The lacklustre player movement also extends to goalkeepers, who not only do NOT save shots with their actual hands (more so a forcefield aura around their gloves, magic!), but fail to make basic saving animations, and often find themselves locked into animations that they are unable to get out of. We've all seen Alisson Becker make a howler as he is diving sideways, despite the ball coming straight at him (I guess?).

For what feels like an eternity, EA have been very fast to implement micro transactions into their games without actually considering improving the fundamental gameplay, which in turn would give a more enjoyable experience and thus make people consider spending their hard earned funds on the game. When one of your landmark features in your ultimate team breakdown is the 'Claim All' Button, shouldn't you be looking elsewhere? New packs have been introduced which can set you back a literal weeks shop (if you're not careful). Thankfully there is some pushback in Europe from countries such as Belgium, but more needs to be done to recognise this in built slot machine, which, is also key to note, is listed as a PEGI 3 (ie. EA are perfectly morally ok with the fact that literal children could be gambling money on their game, just to get a virtual card which will be irrelevant in 12 months!!).

It is safe to say that this is the worst football game experience I have endured in a while. My likelihood of buying the next title is, for the first time ever, hit a new ground zero. I would encourage others to perform something similar until actual, effective, and purposeful change has been implemented to allow for tactical flexibility, gameplay consistency, and a fair playing field for all those who wish to play (from casual to professional players)."
EA+sports+fc+24,Not Recommended,93.8,"Posted: October 14
UPDATED REVIEW:

Please note that this is purely my experience of the game during the stupid hours I have sunk into it.

I won't be completely critical of the game and I'll give credit to a couple of things, most notably the gameplay. I like the animations and the motion of the players, they are fun to control. I play on normal gameplay speed and it feels great. Players are responsive and it is very fun trying to keep shape defensively (especially against ultimate difficulty) but with practice, you get there. Attacking is satisfying too, I like the different dribbling styles, although R1 dribbling at the time of this review is a little overpowered, but even still, I am happy that it's possible to dribble past players in this year's game and score some lovely solo goals.

I play purely offline, as where I am currently located I just cannot get a good enough connection to have any kind of online experience.

HOWEVER - despite EA releasing updates, not one of them has combated the biggest issue myself and many MANY others face, which is the abhorrent optimisation which is leading to stutters and for some, lag and game crashes.

I would not want to know how many of those hours I have spent trialling fixes and it is the first time in my gaming experience to encounter a game that just won't play. Sometimes a workaround will fix things temporarily, but upon the next launch, it just doesn't work again. This to me is unacceptable. They are aware of the problem, yet nothing has changed now for well over a month of it being released. The hell I've been through to sort it should never be required to play any game. I paid £80, but I feel like EA owe me a year's salary for the amount of work I've done on their game for them. Crooks.

Stutters in these kinds of games destroy any pleasurable experience you can get from it. Imagine playing an F1 game, but before every corner it stutters for 3 seconds and when it fixes itself, you've crashed into an entire neighbouring village and caused £500 million worth of damage, you'd say 'Forget it' and toss it in the bin. The same goes for football games. You need precision and reactions because timing is important. You can't do that with 3-second stutters intermittently during a match. How can nobody have seen this? I feel like Mugatu from Zoolander.

It was a new era for the franchise, a fresh start, so I allowed myself to believe that things may be different, but it just isn't the case for any of the offline modes. If you think adding cut scenes of players winning the Balon d'Or (where nobody even speaks other than some announcer, which freaks me out) and an open-top bus parade of trophies you've won (which is cool the first time, but it is the same every single time after) then you don't understand why we play football games - WE WANT TO PLAY, NOT SIT THERE AND WATCH SILENT MOVIES. Is this their attempt at making it more immersive? Disaster.

True, some promising ideas were introduced, like tactical vision and hiring coaches in manager mode, but here's the thing - that was bugged when it was released. Imagine working on a new feature, but for it not to work properly. What I mean is, that you can't fire coaches, you'll lock the game and have no chance to back out. I actually hope it doesn't get patched, because it doesn't matter, it tells us what we already know - they don't care.

It's a shame because I think that if they'd just put more effort into it, this could've been a really good game. The foundation is there with the gameplay, and that's the heart of any good football game. But why not just stop being a bunch of fraggles and develop your offline game modes more? The amount of work they put into 'create a team' for example, which was just uninspiring, is what I am talking about. Put that work into actually making a comprehensive, immersive career mode. 'Create a team' was fantastic in the F1 game, it works in that circumstance, but for a manager mode on a football game? It isn't what we want.

For those who can't be bothered to read all that: you'll feel just like Mugatu from Zoolander - It really is the same face."

I can't believe I wasted my hard-earned money on EA FC 24, and I'm utterly disgusted with this so-called ""game."" It's nothing more than a blatant cash grab designed to milk players for every penny they have. EA should be ashamed of themselves for promoting such a toxic and predatory gaming experience.

First and foremost, the pay-to-win mechanics in this game are absolutely absurd. You're practically forced to open your wallet just to have a fighting chance. Want to unlock your favorite players? Get ready to fork over a small fortune because grinding for them is a futile endeavor. The game's loot boxes are nothing short of a digital casino, preying on vulnerable players who are desperate to assemble a decent team. It's a disgrace!"

THIS IS BY FAR THE WORST FIFA EVER!
I have bought and owned all fifa releases since 2002 on the day it was released. I have paid a premium to EA every year for the fifa franchise for 21 years straight.
The game is absolutely disgusting and ridiculous. Yes they have made a few improvements like they do every year, but along with those improvements which are minimal like always, the things that are wrong with the game made me feel like i just wasted my money and time. I know there is a crazy amount of fifa fans out there, Please do not waste your money. I understand all the latest squads and transfers and other stuff we look forward to which is always discontinued in the last fifa when the actual transfer window begins. Wait for EA to release an update addressing the issues that are there in the game, if they address the issues at all.

Issues that have nothing to do with the gameplay-
*The display refresh rate settings are locked to 60fps. (On Laptop) (Desktop is Adjustable)
*The game stutters and lags and is absolutely impossible at times. This happens even on menu screens in career mode or any other, when you are not even playing a match.
*Drastic and random FPS Drops every 5-10 seconds.
I have a RTX 3060 laptop with 64GB RAM and a RTX 4090 high-end desktop. Same lag and stuttering on both machines. So definitely the problem is with the Game software itself.
This is what i get after paying a premium to one of the biggest franchises in the gaming industry. The game overall feels like it was incomplete in its development but the launch date had to be met. What a shame.

Gameplay Issues:

* The goalkeeper in the game is irrelevant.
* Shooting and finishing is the worst ever.
* Even though the ball control is better and there is an element of ""centre of gravity"" in the movement of the player in control which is nice, i still feel there is so much wrong in the overall movement of the player in control.
* Passing is the worst ever.
* First touch is inconsistent.
There is so much more wrong with the gameplay. And i am hoping that these issues will be addressed with an update. I would be shocked if this is how the game is meant to be.

To All the fifa fans out there. Wait for an update and fixes by EA. The game is not enjoyable and at times unplayable due to stutters and lags. Absolutely not worth a single penny of yours the way it is."

EAFC 24 REVIEW
+ Graphics improvement
+ New gameplay
+ Great UI, But sometimes got UI glitch in FUT cant move / click
+ Dynamic commentator (you can turn off this)
+ Dynamic pre, half and post match cutscene
+ Camera view

- Cursor keep centered in screen after my wireless mouse idle, Cant move menu (Moments, Settings, etc. because of that)
- I dont like EAFC 24 song playlist, FIFA23 better?
- Poor graphics optimization, not ready to release the game?
- Should be cheaper, because no longer use FIFA title name?

ULTIMATE TEAM REVIEW
+ Faster than FIFA23 to choose player in squad
+ Claim all reward for one objective (Not all objective)
+ No longer wasting time playing squad battle, Its quicker than FIFA23
+ Removed loan player in SBC

- Menu with scroll down in the top left corner is bad and hard to see (container too small and need larger / bolder font)
- Hidden red dot button inside Objective page, Hard to see and find completed objective
- Sometimes objective not counted
- No shortcut to go to Squad (down left analog like FIFA23)
- Opponent quit after score the equal goal, not counted as win :(
- Swap side glitch (ex. lead 5-0, then your opponent pause the game and swap the side, you are now losing 0-5, after the endgame you got forever loop post match cutscene, force close this, no worry you still won the game)
- Sometimes force me to disconnect to the main menu and counted as lose (Hack? or Game bug?)
- Women in Ultimate Team is bad idea
- No kits color in scoreboard
- So many SBC requirement error in game / companion (ex: SBC need barca man or women, but marked as invalid if you put barca men in companion or barca women in-game)
- Cant skip stadium/tifo/etc. pack
- Removed rank progress bar in squad battle
- AI HACK IS BACK, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ YOU EA!!!

COMPANION APPS REVIEW
- Unable to filter chemistry styles by type in transfer
- Unable to manager leagues consumable by league styles in transfer
- Unable to change club name
- Unable to change player shirt number
- Unable to pick some player in evolution, need to do it in game (ex: ferran torres in founders evolution, This item does not meet the eligibility requirements)

I play solely on manager career mode so I upgraded to FC 24 mainly because I wanted to do one run as Inter Miami. I could have theoretically made it work by doing transfers on FIFA 23 until the roster was mainly the same but I decided to just go ahead and update the game so that the work would be done for me and so that I would get to try the new game.

Game is about the same overall, but I think it got some nice updates:
- Training is no longer required (or heavily featured) in career mode. I actually thought it was gone until I saw it as optional before game time. This was a big one for me because otherwise you were grinding for the ""all As"" with terrible players at the beginning of the season instead of playing actual matches.
- The cut the scene were they walk out - I know some people gripe about it, but I like how the intro is now shorter. I was skipping the walk out almost every single time so it overall felt like it was flowing a bit better
- The new traits are actually helpful - The trait that lets you dribble is nice and the trait to get longer lines in free kicks is awesome. The latter is one that I will actively scout for because it so useful and make those free kicks less of a guessing game.
- Looks are actually improved this time - When I upgraded for 22 to 23, the looks were objectively worse for me. In 24, the graphics are a bit nicer without requiring me to upgrade my video card.

Overall, if you have FIFA 23 and you can afford it, go for the upgrade. If the price tag is too steep, you are better off staying on FIFA 23 until they have a massive discount on a few months. If you hated 23, then you will hate FC 24 as it is essentially the same game with a few more bells and whistles."

Don't be like me and throw your cash in this dumpster fire and expect something groundbreaking..

My first fifa was 97, been with the series for a while now, thought i'd buy 24 this year because this time it would be different... (new name and sorts). Well you guessed it, nope. Same like it used to be, only worse. Gameplay feels slow, glitching players, defending is hot trash, you can only compete in FUT if you buy a whole team full of high pace players (which are the most expensive ones most of the time). So your forced to put some extra money in if you really want to compete in rivals and champions. Plus if your not playing the meta formation and tactics your getting smacked.

A fun part for me with these kind of games is to build a nice well rounded team, open some packs and hope the rng gods bless me with a good player. EA managed to mess up that part as well because of the women they added. There is nothing more hearth breaking to see ST... PSG.... and to see a women you've never heard of appear instead of Mbappe (We have all seen the youtube videos i guess).

Maybe it's just me and im getting tired of the same formula."
EA+sports+fc+24,Recommended,37.8,"Posted: October 23
I bought this game last week and I'm almost 20 hours in. I'm in a bit of a unique situation as a *very* casual FIFA player. For context, I only recently started getting back into the sport as a spectator after a spell of not caring at all about sports, and as such I decided to buy EAFC 24 so I can play the game in the modern day. For context, the last and only FIFA game I ever had was FIFA 15, so almost 10 years between the editions I bought.

I'm also not your usual FIFA player in that I could not care less about UT. Sure, I'll open it every once in a while, do some objectives, open the reward pack/s and call it a day. But I'm not interested in the competitive play because I'm too ass at the game. If I were to load up a friendly right now I'd get stomped by someone who's played every FIFA since they were born and already has a team of icons and heroes and trailblazers. So, I only play manager and player modes. Mostly player mode, actually. Right now I'm about 4 months into my first year at Reading, with the intention of making the jump to the PL and becoming the world's best CF/CAM in existence.

Of course, this game is buggy. Even as a casual player, I see the bugs that this game has. It's just classic FIFA. I've already seen player models inside each other, incompetent goalkeeping, strange crowd chants for teams that aren't playing, crashes, player images not loading in UT cards, etc. I came into this game expecting this. The bar was low. But, it's been enjoyable. I've been having fun. Player career mode has been particularly fun. I've been on Legendary difficulty and am still able to perform well as an individual. It's not egregiously difficult where I can't score goals or dribble past defenders or make passes, but it's also not insanely easy where I score 4 goals every match and just farm the league. The one thing I really don't like is how the manager favor immediately decides your eligibility for starting 11. I dropped a stinker one game and my manager's favor dropped so much that I was a sub for the next three games despite me being a scoring machine, which doesn't make sense. If Haaland drops a stinker every once in a while and Pep decides to bench him for a month that'd be horrible. But I digress. And no, I don't restart games. I'm not a cheater. If my team loses, then my team loses. If I drop a stinker, then I drop a stinker.

Also, I hate to be that guy, but anyone that's been complaining about the game not running correctly has either never opened the options menu or has a really ♥♥♥♥ computer. I have a gaming laptop, so it's not a potato, but it's also not a full battlestation. The game runs fine at medium settings, hovering around 120 fps. The few times I've played online on FUT have been great and lag-less, which was something I remember very much struggling with on FIFA 15 when I had it.

If you're like me and only buy a FIFA once every few years, I would recommend this game. It has its charm and offers enough to keep you entertained, especially if you don't do UT either. Just make sure to lower your expectations. It's still EA and it's still FIFA. It's not at all perfect. But, it's fun, and that's what matters to me."

The game runs horribly! Removal of many tweak-able graphics options. Constant stuttering at any graphical configuration. Removal of the FIFA name delivering a half baked game and engine and the most egregious price increase! They just reorganize the UI in a 'new' but ultimately less desirable way and charge you full price and then some every year! The game only has to exist these days because there is no competition.

This game runs terribly on my AMD RX 7900 XTX, and I'm checking for driver updates every day. We're mainly playing Clubs; when a game starts the frame rate grinds down to 7 FPS for about 20 seconds and I can't even play the game. It'll also do that between cut scene transition to gameplay. It's so poorly optimized for PC. Not to mention how bad the AI is in this game. It's just all atrocious and it's really egregious that they charge $70 for this game.

Also let me play this game on Linux. Fix the anti-cheat to let me play on Linux since Windows is trash."

Obviously this is a new concoction and movement from the move when playing FIFA last season and switching to FC24 now, it's very similar to a new game, it doesn't feel like jumping one season but 2 seasons in the future. The newest third generation interaction from Hypermotion is directly referred to as Volumetric. The movement is indeed close to real players, its implementation in the Frosbite engine is really good to be applied to all real players with different physiques which have their own characteristics for each player's license, right, starting from the physical clothing worn and the physical anatomy of the body which is fairly accurate like this is a game with various dimensions of movement, what we actually feel is the same as when watching a live match on the field, each player character has different characteristics, body weight and height, which mutually influence their abilities, body position according to game tactics and timing. It makes more sense that sometimes we as players have difficulty guessing which direction to defend and which direction to exploit, it's very natural, very fluid, plus this playstyle is more assertive than the previous traits.

But that doesn't compare to the bugs offered to some other random players, on the device I play on the most annoying thing is the low-fps bug in cutscenes which tends to not be able to touch the minimum value of 60fps with the right aligned specs I have, you can imagine how much Nauseatingly, I saw 10-30 fps which was not constant but had massive ups and downs.

In terms of appearance, starting from menus, fonts and commentators, this is indeed EA's biggest leap this year, everything has been refreshed in such a way that the identity of the newest EA FC can be clearly formed that this is truly a game that cannot be separated from dependence on FIFA. But there is one thing that I hate to reduce playing this game for a long time, because you have to know that in EA FC24 there is no cutscene before the match for the cutscene of appointing the line-up, formation, and players when entering the field, lining up, and introduced. It's disgusting that there are no cutscenes like this, even though it's normal for football games, we play to feel the atmosphere firsthand and we pay according to the facilities available, but in fact it's not appropriate. It's really disappointing that EA FC doesn't want to share CUTSCENE LINE-UP or is this intentional to remove it, especially for NextGen users? Bad or rotten, for those of you who accept this major flaw, I can't consider it minor, to be honest.

And having entered TU3 since this review was written, my proud club, Chelsea FC, which has a licensed contract with EA, has not yet received an update on all its jersey kits with a new sponsor officially, even though it was introduced to the public long ago last week. I really can't think, look my flying hours are still low because of everything I'm telling you"

My honest opinion about the game and just so you know I'm a 41 year old gamer who's been playing his good share of video games on consoles for a while and have recently switched to PC gaming. I know most of the people say it's the same thing every year and yeah, they are right. You are basically buying an update for the teams and their roster every year with a few extra in-game animations. Almost the same thing most of you probably do when buying Call of Duty every year. Now, the most important thing about this. Am i having fun with it? So far YES! Does it work and runs well,smooth on my set up? YES it works perfectly fine with some tweaks of course (no stuttering,screen tearing or frame rate drops) So in the end it's really up to you if you want to buy it and try it (Just make sure your set up can run it please). Besides, You don't have to buy every single Fifa title every year, same thing with Call of Duty. You can always take a break from them every 1 or 2 years and you will see you will have fun the next time you buy those games. It's what i do and i suggest you do the same, otherwise you are gonna end up getting tired and hating on the franchise."

This is not only the worst fifa I've ever played, this is the worse game I've ever played
1. There are no casuals left
Literally everybody is lying in a pool full of sweat giving their soul to beat you, everyone has youtube tactics, knows corners and kick off routines, EVERYTHING that is a glitch is used by the community religiously
2. There is no football in this game
This is not football, I can't even compare it to something, some people said it's ping pong, it's close, but not as good. The ball just jumps around and gets caught between players where it switches possession about 5 times in 10 seconds, which will drive you mad. The meta is run down the line and pass it into the center to score in the empty net. THIS HAPPENS EVERY ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ GAME MAN, EVERY GAME, people don't play originally at all, they just play the same idiotic tactic that works and good riddance
3. This is not a game, this is a work place
You play games to have fun, the football in this game is not fun, it's madness inducing. The slots they have in the game are fun. So you basically go to work (play the ''football'' in the game) to get to the fun part, the slots machines
4. The middle of the pitch doesn't exist
You just can't play down the middle, nothing goes through, the chance of you completing a through pass through the middle ARE ZERO. So that's basically why everyone plays down the wing and passes into the box... because it's almost the only way to score. Most people spin 7 times in the same place until you do a mistake and pass it, it's ridiculous
5. THE PRESSING TACTICS ARE CRAZY
There is a glitch that goes like this, u go 71 depth or above, and the whole game ur team presses like mad. The issues is everyone has it activated, which gives you absolutely no time to relax, ur under constant stress during the whole game, very very very very very very bad experience
6. If your team isn't meta, forget about it
You can't play this game seriously unless ur team is goated, players like mbape for example just ghost through your defense, and if u play the game long enough, you see all the keepers dive the opposite way when he is shooting
7.Call it DDA, call it scripting, idk, BUT THERE IS SOMETHING
every time you hit the bar, the ball comes back to your player so you can score, if you go up 5-0, ur opponent team BECOMES INSANE, your team start acting like idiots while ur opponents team becomes godly. I was down 4-0 this year and managed to beat my opponent 7-6, I WAS WAY WORSE THAN HIM, THE GAME LITERALLY CARRIED ME, yesterday my opponent was 5-0, I activated constant pressure and came back and it ended 5-5, with me almost winning the game in the last minute. THIS IS NOT NORMAL
8. The game is infested with hackers
There are so many hackers I need a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ book to explain how many ♥♥♥♥ goes on in this game
9. You won't see the good players unless you spend THOUSANDS
I've been playing UT since fifa 14, and trust me, you don't get good players, you just don't doesn't matter what u grind, how much u play, unless you take out that credit card u won't have the team u want
10.The worse part is EA doesn't mind any of this issues
They just don't care, there are HUNDREDS of issues I could add to this topic, but it would take too much time from my life for a piece of ♥♥♥♥ game that WILL NEVER BE GOOD"

Pros from my perspective:
The menu feels much more responsive and faster.
The evolution of players in ultimate team is a great idea.
Removing position changes is great.
Game feels a bit more responsive but that could just be because it’s the first week.
Love the new cameras and how it shows during gameplay the shooting stats and different statistic.

Cons :
Goalkeepers are useless.
Goals from every angle.
Kick off momentum is still there and will always be there.
Ultimate team feels like some sort of Volta now, all those new female players with super ratings , the 1,5 meter female midget outpacing and pushing aside my Van Dijk seems unreal and unrealistic (even for a video game that claims to simulate football). I love this game and will continue playing but its just ridiculous, I don t mind having them introduced but make REALISTIC ratings which will never happen because no one will play them anymore so probably the FIFA community will just have to suck it up. I get that they want to push gender equality, but what’s going to be next? Make them literally 1 foot taller so that they could win headers easier?"

The worst game ever in regards to optimization.
Not only am I covering the PC requirements but I shall be able to play at Ultra without any lag.
But still, even when playing with the lowest graph the game still lags and ruins that ruins everything.
The most ridiculous thing is that just after the release it was running smoother than now after updates, patches and so on.
Yes, there was still lag from time to time but when playing with MAX graph, not with MIN as now.
I'm starting to think that EA posted false system requirements to scam people to buy their game or the only thing they do to the game is make it worse with every next patch and update.
There are good things though - the player's motion is great and more realistic than ever. Mechanics-wise the game is the greatest Fifa so far. Totally love the way the players interact and act as a whole.
But it's freakn unplayable with all the lag.
I even thought about upgrading my PC but then I realized that the problem isn't on my side so even if I upgrade this otherwise amazing game will remain unplayable because of the lag.
I feel cheated."

Intense ""Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind"" vibes.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Fun, but very easy. It's a great game to sit down with for a couple days and build a big sprawling village, and you'll probably get at least 10 or 20 hours out of it, but I don't see myself wanting to come back to it too much.

It's biggest strength is it's visuals - it's still fun to zoom in and watch the villagers going about their day in the Studio Ghibli-esque visuals even at the end of the playthrough.

Sadly, looking at things or fast-forwarding will occupy the vast majority of your time, because this game is very simple and not challenging, even on the hardest difficulty setting. It suffers from the problem that many similar settlement building games suffer from: the first 2 hours of your run will be difficult and you'll feel like your decisions matter, but as soon as your economy is set up, everything starts playing itself and you begin to grow exponentially way faster than the challenge can keep you in check.

However, if what you're looking for is a relaxed and forgiving romp through a charming village. If you want to place houses and manage resource flows with a little bit of threat to it interesting, this is probably a good pick up. But if you are looking for a more engaging, thoughtful city-builder that will force you to make difficult decisions, play Frostpunk instead."

A less cruel Frostpunk.
Suggestions:
- Villagers should sleep at the place that is closest to their workspace, or we should be able to specify the sleeping place for individual villager
- There should be a priority for storage places. I keep ending up having 40/40 heal herbs in Onbu healing camp and 0 in villager healing camp
- There should be a setting for animation speed, after 10 hours it kind of gets on my nerves to wait .5 seconds when switching zoom
- Maybe there should be an even faster time setting, 6x?

Overall, I'd give the game 7/10 right now and up to 10/10 if it keeps getting updates."

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
as much as i want to like this game i just cant recommend it in its current state. its difficult to put into words but it feels like the balancing is just wrong. villagers move too slowly and aimlessly to deal with urgent tasks. for example, even on beginner difficulty it can take my village of 60 people days upon days to clear out spores from the second spore cloud in that save. the only way to get enough manpower to reconstruct buildings after a natural disaster is to shut down everything else including farming and cooking because if not villagers just wander around completely directionless and eat food instead of building.

for lack of a better description it also feels like villagers don't do as much work as they require. in other words, for every villager you take on, the amount of work needed to maintain equilibrium in your village goes up by slightly more than that villager can handle. the result of this is that the more villagers i acquire, the fewer villagers i have free for construction and the longer it takes me to get things built, maintained, and repaired, when it should be the opposite.

i have a few suggestions that i think would make the game much more friendly for new players, quality of life stuff that wouldn't affect balancing in any way as i am certainly not qualified to talk about something that nuanced.
first: add an option to control individual villagers. too many times i've seen a villager finish chopping down a tree, decide her work is done, and book it a mile back to base camp to have her lunch, leaving someone else to pick up the wood that SHE CUT and carry it literally 10 feet to the construction site, only for them in turn to leave and make someone else actually construct the thing. if i could tell a villager to pick up their own wood and construct their own tent it would make repair jobs much easier, faster, and less stressful than waiting for the goons at the worker outpost to get up and do their job.
second: allow automatic harvesting. when the woodcutters run out of material they should go out and harvest their own, and when i have workers set to harvester they should know the woodcutter is out of material and go and harvest it automatically without me having to manually assign what they're cutting. i know this is not a unanimous opinion but i think it would make the gameplay loop much more enjoyable, especially since even when the woodcutter is out of wood and the workers are set to harvester AND i have trees highlighted the workers sometimes won't harvest for no apparent reason.

lastly, though this is not under the changes section because i don't know how you would change it, i think the onbu is simply too large. workers need to shuttle back and forth from the head to the center to the tail constantly and i personally think it's silly to require two or even three individual villages on the back of one onbu just to staff the required infrastructure. i shouldn't need to assign half my population to dung duty and place a second woodcutter, stonecutter, berry farm, kitchen, farm, and pantry there just to supply the dung collector and compost heap.

i think this game is excellent. the first forty days of the novice save file are genuinely enjoyable, i love the music, and the concept is all there, the balance just needs work to make it really shine."

Review updated!

TL;DR Pros
+ Cute & cozy
+ Amazing premise and potential
+ Progress that makes sense
+ Aesthetics and sountrack

TL;DR Cons:
- Repetitive core gameplay loop
- A lot of downtime

The long bit:

I love Onbu. I didn't have the heart to cause Onbu any pain, and spent the vast majority of my game time trying to keep Onbu healthy and comfortable. Seeing the message that Onbu's tail is wagging melted my cold, dead heart. Sprinting through toxic environments, making sure Onbu is fed so that there is no attempts at eating suspiciously mushroom shaped rocks, and sleeping in the soft fluffy bits. All for Onbu. You can't give me a six legged rocklizardpuppy and expect me to hurt it, I will love it until I die.

The concept of this game is incredible, and I love the potential of it. The ability to move to new environments is something that many games have attempted, usually through resettlement, and have generally failed or caused gripes in playerbases due to having to rebuild from the ground up again. The visuals and soundtrack help establish the setting and biomes, and the mixture of 3D and 2D sprites is lovely. While the paths that you can choose are linear, it makes sense in the context of Onbu being its own autonomous entity.

The game also progresses in ways that are logical. There isn't a lot of nonsensical additions, and essentially everything is focused on survival. Perhaps some entertainment buildings in the future to help boost productivity, even though it isn't too difficult to keep maxed at the moment. The decorations was a nice addition, especially as it is rare in games for them to also carry a practical purpose beyond simply adding aesthetics.

My issue with the content has mostly been remedied! The Ocean update added a lot of new things to do and research, which improved replayability significantly. Additionally the changes in game starting choices is adding challenge where there previously was little. While the gameplay is still repetitive, there is enough intrigue to keep going and try new things. However, game still struggles with the sensation of idleness for me, but that might simply be due to my preference to micromanage to a borderline unhealthy degree.

And I feel like that is still my main problem. Once you learn how the game works, and what each new technology adds, the only thing left for you to do is cycle production whenever the biome changes, and click on the map every few minutes.

But I was correct in my last review! I have changed my mind about whether or not it is worth the price tag. The developers are extremely passionate about the game, and it was part their love for it that made me buy it in the first place. There is constantly new content, and they are active within their own community. I have faith in the developers, and am certain that they will continue to add content. I have essentially doubled my hours since the first review at the time of writing this, which should already be a good sign of improvement! I will keep checking new updates, and look forward to full release.

Keep it up, devs! You have an absolutely fantastic gem in your hands, that just needs a bit of polish ♥"

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
The game art is very cute and the music is quite calm and relaxing. Love the hand drawn animations for the buildings and villagers, Onbu is a sweety too. Have not encountered any bugs during my playtime.

Here are the reasons why I would not recommend the game currently:

It's not a hard game but if you get really unlucky early on your run might be killed off. If Onbu wanders into the desert for example, because you can't control him because he doesn't trust you yet and you can't grow cacti and you can't send out explorers yet or there is no oasis to collect water from - your people will starve and you really can't do anything about that.
So you will learn to start your village in one specific way every time – which I don't think is fun.

Harvesting poison plants should be high priority always, I do not want to click through 30 individual plants to set the priority high. It's good that their offspring will keep the priority you set tho.

I feel like there's a lot of just watching the game instead of doing something. The game feel overall very slow and I am playing in x4 speed at any time.

A bunch of the research things are basically ways to profit from Onbu by physically harming him. As in taking gallbladder fluid, blood, feeding him things that upset his stomach or drilling into his skin to take stone.
And it says it will decrease his trust in you and you will have to also constantly heal him so he doesn't literally die because you abused him but overall I didn't feel like I was being punished for harming him. And I think these things SHOULD be punished by the game as you are hurting the thing that protects you, you shouldn't be able to easily get away with hurting Onbu just because you also gave him a snack and a pet. Maybe he should refuse your food and pets while you actively or just recently hurt him?

Sadly, I am not really having fun while playing, it makes me sleepy in fact.
It might turn into something more fun but right now I do not recommend buying this for 25 Euro. I payed 20 during Steam Sale and I honestly don't think that even that was justified in the games current state.
I played for 7ish hours now and basically “finished” the early access by building the monument and I can't see myself picking it up again in the near future because it's just not very engaging or fun."

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
IMPORTANT: The thumbs down is meant to be a ""NOT YET, BUT KEEP AN EYE ON IT!"".

(I started at Adept, since I played several city builders before.)

After almost 8 hours I got through, but at least on Adept it was way too easy. It took some micromanagement but my people always had enough food, Onbu was always topped off. Noone was sick for long. I never had to gather stone, blood or bile from Onbu. Trees respawn, berry collectors never deplete their bushes, even the small stones respawn. Water collects itself outside the desert. One herb garden is enough to supply all your people and Onbu.

The only real moment of fear was my first infection, but you dont even need the flamethrower guys. You can just unemploy everyone, harvest everything infected and re-employ.

Additionally, exploring the surroundings gives a bit too many resources. Yielding 60 water from one oasis in a few hours does not compare to the time my farmers need to grow that many cacti. Two teams of explorers was enough to never really gather wood or stone from Onbu.

Also researching is pretty bland. It only takes time and Knowledge points your explorers bring home.


Summary: As of now it has a lot of potential. The limited space, having to explore the surroundings for resources. balancing needs of your villagers with those of Onbu. But it does not yet deliver, since the state of the village and Onbu is too stable (too self-sufficient). It needs to enforce more strategic decisions, which in other games is nicely achieved by ambiguity of goods. Make it that some food items are needed for medicine. That iron smelters need wood, that people go on strike when you dont fulfill their needs.
Sadly I cannot recommend it at the moment, but I will play it again at Veteran and wait for what is to come.

Update: I played it on Veteran as well now and I am not sure in which regard it is supposed to be more difficult, as the overall challenge, gameplay and events were all the same ._. I understand that it is Early Access, so I hope that there will be respective updates. All in all the foundation is there and it is beautiful and promising but the devs have to put in a lot of additional work at the right spots to make it really worthwile."

However, there isn't much content. What make it worse is that there isn't much content planned based on the Early Access road map recently announced.

Hmmm... That’s a hard one..
The setting is absolutely gorgeous, the gameplay a classic builder with no big innovations (except that your world is walking on six legs), but cute, charming, and in later game probably not as easy as it looks at first glance.
I'd quit after 6h while still playing the very first tutorial mission. In the state the game is atm it works flawlessly, but everything takes forever. I felt like always missing a certain resource to keep on building and exploring the game the way I'd liked to. And this is in the tutorial world, which is described as easy with a lot of materials. And even as I was almost the whole time busy doing something, or at least watching my villagers doing something, I constantly missed a feeling of progression.

To recommend the game feels weirdly wrong to me, even I enjoyed my first five hours. I'll probably start the game one more time after final release and see, if and how it may change and give it another go.
I really wish to like this game more the next time."

cute game but extremely dependent on your first moves, if you don't B-line it for the solutions to your future problems, there is often no recovering from the horrors you'll face, the fungus spreads so unbelievably aggressively, even with the flame thrower guys its nuts to fight against, but as long as you have a full team of doctors fighting the poison you'll make it through even the worse fungul storms, not to mention onbu is NOT a big tough boi, he is a mo ♥♥♥♥♥ squishy baby and will absolutely fail to make it on his own, if you do not watch his every step, and make sure hes fed, and un poisoned youll basically lose the whole run, he cannot feed himself well at all, there are some rng chances he will get food, but he will sooner die of starvation than go out of his way to eat, and this boi will literally never hustle unless you tell him to.
he will slowly walk, or even GOD FORBID lie down and take a nap in what i can only describe as the most hostile places in existence. but either way if you juggle all these factors the entire game becomes quite relaxing and can easily eat a whole day in what feels like moments."

Make no mistake, the downvote is one of those ""because steam doesn't have a neutral rating"" situations. I absolutely adore this game, and everything about it. The smooth ambient music, the cute simple artstyle, the absolutely massive and ADORABLE Onbu and the decent amount of challenge that exists too.

...I however simply cannot recommend this game, not yet, not in its current state.

Early Access is one thing but right now the game is barely beyond ""proof of concept"" stage. It's way too simplistic in mechanics, at times rather unfair with a difficulty spike of ""Oh you picked the easiest choice but reached this arbitrary point on the map? Now we set it straight to the highest difficulty, have fun!"" type of ""ending"" and while yes, game development is not easy the content updates are far too slow of a trickle for such a near ""pre-alpha"" level state for this game. It needs a lot, and i mean A LOT more content before i'd consider changing my view.

I very much look forward to seeing if and how this game will pan out in the future.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
I hate to downvote a game this cute, but to be honest, I was surprised about all the upvotes it's getting. The gimmick of building a city on the back of the six legged turtle is a fun idea, but it really has almost no actual gameplay impact - the world map seems interesting at first, but it surves no real purpose and doesn't really add much to the game due to everything being so random and so repetitive. If there was a larger view, maybe you'd have to think and consider going to a forrest for a few years or something like that, but the way it's now it's just 'pick the path that doesn't lead to a biome that will hurt your people' and that's it. Any interaction with the overworld also quickly turns into a mindless chore - send out endless exploring parties who with almost zero interaction return with resources you don't really care about and repeat, over and over.

That would be fine if it was an aspect of an otherwise good city builder, but that's just it - the base game is not a good city builder. It gets the mechanics right, but its like a soulless bureocrat was told about city builders and designed one - gather wood, gather stone, build homes, gather food, get more people, build farms, improve wood and stone, research better buildings. If someone held a gun to your head and forced you to come up with the most generic city builder, this is what would come out. None of it is done badly, it's just very bland and in no aspect have I seen anything inventive or interesting to set it apart from other games in the genre.

At $5 I would probably still have been left somewhat disappointed. It is by no means a bad game, just also not a good one."
the+wandering+village,Recommended,6.9,"Posted: September 19, 2022
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
I'm honestly a bit torn on this game.

First of all, it's quite fun to play. The mechanic to basically keep your mount ""alive"" is interesting, there's a lot of different buildings you can utilize and the ""world map"" feature in which you can basically send out scavenger squads to harvest resources (like in frostpunk, for example) is good and fun and. The building system is also quite simple and not very complex, which might be a plus for many people, personally, I'd prefer a little bit more depth.

I did have a lot of fun with the game, but there's also major gripes:

First of all, while the ""keep your mount alive"" part is interesting, it's also unnecessary - you have to feed the thing once every 30 minutes and that's it. I've build the doctor hut for it and not once did I have to use it besides healing a poison once, and I could've just not done that. It's a badly balanced mechanic that doesn't really serve any purpose and just occupies a handful of villagers, you have to manually turn the buildings on and off to free them so they can do something more useful.

Second, the graphics. While they are not bad by any means and the creature you're riding on is gorgeous, the village and the villager itself are all 2D and this vastly downgrades the visual fidelity. I don't know why they made the decision to create the game in 2D - potentially because of a small team and not enough resources to create a 3D or at least 2.5D game, but it's a major factor that really rubs me the wrong way.

The last problem is simple - content. You can finish a run in about 3 - 4 hours. Your last task is to build a big statue that costs a few advanced resources (which you should honestly have at the end of the run) and then it basically transforms into endless mode. The problem is that every run feels roughly the same. The map doesn't change, the biomes don't change - you start the same way every time and there is no variety. That's vastly different in other games in the genre - again, I use frostpunk as example. Frostpunk has edicts, so you can alter the ideology of your town. You can be a highly christian authoritarian that basically creates the nazi-vatican that forces children to work in coal mines or you can become the benevolent mayor of your little ice city. Also, there is a variety of maps in the game, so every playthrough is different. This is completely missing in the wandering village. It's just the same run over and over again.

Overall, I think the game is a bit lacking and the only reason why I'm recommending this is because it's still early access. I have high hopes for the game and if the devs pull the right strings, they could easiely make a great game ouf of this."

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
The good:
I enjoy the limited story that is there
Onbu is very cute
there is quite a lot to manage for those that like that
the city building changes nearly every run with different configurations of onbu

The meh:
you are permanently locked into a 45 degree angle view which doesn't really feel great
It feels like villagers actively ignore priority, in my playtime I did NOT see any change from getting things built no matter the priority, though this could be because I was not great at managing them

The bad:
the first run feels cool because you are seeing everything for the first time but repeat runs with modifiers certainly feel samey, with the fact that events dont change based on difficulty(did two runs, easy and normal mode), the limited number of events also dont help this problem
A lot of the playtime is spent waiting, wether it be for resources to grow, building to be built, or just waiting for 500Km to finish a run
Villagers often waste raw resources to refine them even when not needed and you cant set a limit for them to stop refining

Overall:
I think the game is good for the people that already enjoy city builders, for those that don't I would say probably either wait for more content or pass on it, as it stands I enjoyed my first run but by about hour 3 I was realizing the monotony that comes with just adding farms and waiting to add more people to my colony, In my opinion I think more crops with a dedicated cold crop would be better to break up the monotony of just spamming beets/wheat/berries, as for tech I would like to see some kind of teraforming tech to turn certain parts to dirt and certain parts to farmland as a late game tech.

TL;DR 6.5/10 for me, though i dont love samey city builders so it may change for you, certainly try it if its on sale"

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
As this is an Early Access review, the first thing I need to make clear is that the Wandering Village I played was fully functional. The worst I can say about its performance is that I could tell when it was auto-saving due to a brief stutter... on 4x speed. It even ran as well on the Steam Deck, despite a handheld not being the best choice for a city builder.

That's not to say the controller support was lacking. It all worked great and was as intuitive as a genre that was so clearly set up for point-click-hover mouse control could possibly be.

There was also a complete game's worth of content, with enough variation in the technology trees and environment challenges to keep things all-engrossing until the game said it was over. That isn't to say you weren't perfectly allowed to keep playing the mobile mesa you'd built for five times as long, just that there wasn't enough new to discover or react to for all of that extra time to remain rewarding.

Everything else about the Wandering Village experience is exactly as advertised, though I never did feel the need to zoom down to my villagers' eye line. The casual, nature-focused art style was supported by a New Age-y, lost-to-time soundtrack that I would have called repetitive if it didn't fit the mood so well. Together, they can almost convince you that the world's not so harsh after all. If you can avoid the temptation to let your guard down, you might survive, even thrive, in a land covered in poisonous plants set against just that."

The game gets really repetitive, really fast, and there's no replayability to the game unlike other games that have shorter play times. Even when the game is finished and out of early access, I struggle to see how they would charge more than $15-$20 unless they have some major plans in the works, but with the current road map I could see myself getting only another 5 hours out of it maybe. I followed this game for a while before it released and am pretty disappointed with the price/quality ratio, and while it is a very beautiful game, there's not much 'game' to it. If there was more to the game or they charged a reasonable price for it, this would definitely be a buy rating, but something needs to change in that ratio."

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
This is a very nice game. The art style is nice and the animations are cute. It has a very interesting take at the city builder genre. Its easy to get in and have a chill time building and managing your settlement. Events are often mild and didnt have any that had my settlement ruined, which I like.

The need to adapt to various biomes is interesting and often a good challenge if you are ill-prepared. Especially food and water can turn to be an issue if you react poorly. But that's part of the learning curve.

I also like the notion of portraying the need for symbiosis, aka cooperation, between the creature and the people, as they have to struck a balance between exploiting the creature (clearly a stand-in for nature, as its literately carrying us on its back) for own survival, but not to a point that it dies and us with it.

Although this review is negative, it's worth stating the game itself is quite good in many ways; it looks great, it plays well, and it's quite addictive.

I reviewed it negatively to say I don't recommend because it's just not worth the money; after 10 hours I'd literally done everything and if I'm being honest, it had already gotten quite repetitive a few hours before that. £20 is a relatively high price for a 10 hour game compared to some stuff on the market you can get hundreds of hours of fun for less.

I will gladly change my review at some point providing they either halve the cost, or significantly increase the content because it's not a bad game at it's core - there just isn't enough of it to remotely justify the price so right now I cannot recommend."

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
I definitely recommend it, but there are some tentative parts I'll explain.

The Wandering Village is a pretty unique management game. You indirectly control your villagers by essentially pointing out the things you want done and then giving that task a priority. Villagers also work at structures that they build, which takes away from your fluid labor force (general workers). While you're checking on them, you're also riding a freakin' giant walking animal because your only other choice is a life of poison and death on the ground. So you also need to keep Onbu--the creature you ride--alive. You do this by feeding, healing, and curing. But you can also guide Onbu when you gain it's trust, which is especially important when it comes to the biomes you will come across and what you feel prepared for. You could also choose to forego the trust and simply take from the beast and deal with what comes. In short, you have to juggle a lot of important matters, sometimes a few all at once.

Starting out, the tutorial does a good job of explaining what needs to be done, but I feel it could emphasize the trust mechanic with Onbu better. Specifically explaining the benefits of valuing trust vs. ignoring it. There is a lot to learn, so it's possible I missed a few details as well, but the nice thing about the game is how it rewards patience and being observant. You may eventually answer your own question about something just by continuing to play. I find it challenging to manage, but extremely satisfying and relaxing when things just work out. But they don't always work out and you can easily cause a lot of problems for yourself if you're not careful. I managed to avoid dying a couple of times, but even now at 16 hours, I'm in a tight spot again. The challenge doesn't let up, but I actually appreciate that.

My biggest problems are mostly related to it being in Early Access. I want more content, more dynamic systems (why even have worker huts, really?), and I'd like a bit more story. I'm also finding that stone is a difficult resource to keep stocked, particularly in the late game. There are some random encounters you can experience along the way and I found out that they seem to repeat more often than I'd like. I'd definitely appreciate more variety there. And lastly, while I don't hate the price, it is pretty high for what you get. But, to be fair, if everything on their Early Access roadmap is implemented, it's easily worth that price.

Overall, I have had a fantastic time being awake until 2 am on multiple sessions because there's always more to do and more to improve. It really sucked me in for a good while. I highly recommend it if you want a more unique take on managing a small civilization.

Also, I'd die for my Onbu."

I'm leaving a positive review despite not being able to honestly recommend the game in it's current state. That being said, it would be unfair to give it a negative review since the game has a lot of potential and it's still in early access.
The idea of the game is quite original and it has been neatly implemented. I didn't notice any major bugs or game-breaking lack of balance. The graphics is nice and the music is acceptable I guess (didn't pay much attention to it). What the game lacks is content. There should be more of everything - technologies, buildings, biomes, resources. Late-game is pretty much non-existant and the game becomes quite repetitive after you've seen all biomes (which usually occurs around 30th day, while the game is designed to last for 100+ days). I got quite bored with the game after discovering all major techs and finding out there's nothing more to do and there's nothing that threatens my settlement anymore (around day 120 or ~8 hours of gameplay). I will give this game another chance in a year or so when there would hopefully be more content."

I played over 100 hours, from exploiting the demo, being part of the beta tester, to content creator. I love this game so much. The art is so good and lovely with matching music and theme, the game can be a bit difficult for new players, but learning about the layout and how your Onbu react is the key to satisfaction. In this game, we are not just making a village, but also make sure said village provide for Onbu that carries them. Sometimes, it means to make Onbu feels hurt for a bit, on some others maybe because lack of preparations, we got to painfully extract blood from Onbu so the village may survive. Each game have its own stories, because the terrain and what in it is randomly generated. Each game is a sweet mix of village builder and survival."

I want to like this game, I do. But there's just no direction. I love the idea of being able to choose to befriend or essentially enslave the monster that your village sits on. But there doesn't seem to be any goal. Survival sure, but to what end? Are you escorting the monster to its mating grounds? Heading somewhere to die? Are we trying to rekindle the last sparks of humanity, or just find a nice place to live? We don't know, because the game doesn't tell us. We just trudge on forever until the game gets too hard and we die or you end and get a monument. Give me a reason to choose the worse path because there may be something there I need. Make me choose to be mean to my monster because its for its own good. This game could be such a great story, but it just isn't there yet. Its early access, so I am very hopeful that one will arrive, but as of right now, for the asking price, its not worth it IMO."

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
If video games are themselves a tech tree, ""Banished"" unlocks a lot of different other games. Itself ""what if Sim City but production chains,"" you can up the game aspects and come up with Timberborn, lower them and get Age of Man, add in more narrative and get Frostpunk, up the individuality and you get Rimword, up the production chain detail and get One More Island, up the detail and realism and get Farthest Frontier and so on. Yeah, this isn't literal, don't @ me about chronology.

The Wander Village is what if Banished, but a strategic layer. Strategic layers are fun ideas that usually don't work too well, because inevitably it means jamming one game onto another game, and one of the pair will suffer. Even when it works, it doesn't work.

The Wandering Village is the exception because the strategic layer is intuitive. It's a big animal, it gets hungry, tired, and sick. It takes care of itself, but does better with some attention, and needs more the later in the game and the harder the environment. It takes the place of what might be the military aspect of a different game, and like the best implementations of those feels wrapped tightly in, creating a wide spectrum of choices and ways to develop.

I suspect that the tech tree and food will be tinkered with, and the UI has some frustrations. There is no ability to determine the sex of the rock dinosaur, which, come on devs, you're leaving a solid Discworld gag lying right there. I'm undecided on whether the event pacing is right, but that will make a difference for the replayability. It feels priced correctly in terms of what you get now, so it's recommendable in early access, and more about whether anything gets screwed up in the finalization of the game rather than what more gets added.

So, while it depends on what you're looking for out of a city builder, this is a recommend if you like them."

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
BLUF: Beautiful Game that needs balancing, but stands enough on its own two feet to be an introduction to city builders.

This game has a lot of heart. I know how dumb that sounds in the modern gaming market, but you get that feeling at every step of this game, from the art style to the music and sound effects, it all plays together well and you can tell a lot of focus went into it.

Currently, however, I cant in good faith recommend it for one reason. Balancing. This games balancing is all over the place, the biggest culprit of which is food production. In games similar to this, food production is always that little bug buzzing in your ear and is to be expected. However, those other games have the luxury of map space, while this does not. Compounding the issue, is that no matter how big you make your farm on your limited area or how much you staff it, the farmers will refuse to cultivate more than 10 plots of the farm. This leads to famine, every time. Yes, you could build more farms, but the problem will still persist. My working theory is that you need 1 farm per 10 people (possibly 8), and need 5 of them to run the farm. So for every 10 people, you only get 5 actual workers, which then sends a ripple effect to the other production and housing systems. Which sucks, because the bio system they have for best crop types per biome, is a refreshing idea that cant be fully utilized.

Hopefully its just a bug and not something hard coded to be like that for the illusion of always behind.

At beginning it may be hard to master, but once you know how to plan a village, what to prioritize and how to keep Onbu happy and healthy - it becomes very easy and little repetitive. Story is short for now. You survive until And it's over. So I hope that full release will offer more story! And more challenge and more variability.

As for being early release, I encountered no bugs. Everything works beautifully.

What's best about it? It's nice to have survival city builder which offers something more than simply building and managing your city. You have to pay attention to the map and keep alive the creature that carries your village. It's a fun take on city builder. Also, Onbu is really cute.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
So lets start off with discussing what i see to be reoccurring criticism and my experience with it.

Difficulty:
Yes when playing on the normal difficulty, it definitely felt easy, as someone who has played games like this quite a bit

Simulation:
This is far from the simulations provided in Dwarf Fortress and Rim World and you certainly lack the same level of development and control that these provide in that aspect.

Now with those in mind your probably asking yourself ""ok so why are you recommending it"" and thats because despite those two things its still really fun and really niche. Your not just managing your villagers and village you also have to keep in mind that the giant rock dragon ur on is important to ur survival. Maintaining trust by feeding him and healing him so you can help direct him around the world, and avoid storms. Also the fact your on the back of a giant dinosaur means you have to put way more thought into managing space and resources, since their not quite infinite. While resources can be gain by scouts going out into the world to gain resources from off dino sights, its never going to be as much as you gain from the back of puff the magic dragon. Its a super cute, and interesting idea that is embodied brilliantly. The game is still early access, and i only see it getting better, as of now its definitely a great game that i recommend, with a higher difficulty if you need that. definitely a solid 20 hours of a few runs and even more if you want to seek those achievments and such. Im excited to see where this game goes next!

Great game, would definitely recommend.

Edit:
♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ I TAKE BACK WHAT I SAID ABOUT DIFFICULTY
well sorta
but im coming back to update this bc i felt like this recent expierence contradicts what my statements on difficulty say. Poison dude. Poison. Some games have enemies, invading armies, storms, nah, this game its poison, half of my villages population, desolated. I wasnt properly prepared for the poison clouds, i wasnt paying enough attention to Onbu's route, right through 2 clouds, and my island is covered in infested plants, and in a desperate struggle to build decaminator's, produce more herbs, and cut down as many infested growths as possible while loosing more and more population, making this all harder. It looks like this may cause the death of what was a 50+ pop village. Its worth mentioning that in terms of food, ive been breaking mostly even, never having an overwhelming surplus, and this has worsened due to the current poison issue. I imagine on Veteran these issues are way more difficult and one would encounter them earlier on. Next play through i think will be on veteran, just to see.

Updated Review: I liked the new Ocean Biome update, new biome and new buildings definitely added some more nice content. Art was already great. Hostility modifiers at least added some replay value, which is always nice to have. Especially in short games like this. I didn't play the game since a long while now and there seems to be some updates on important game aspects as well, you can now somewhat control and adjust your Onbu trust better. New research tree additions were definitely needed. Game still lacking in some aspects like any solid end game goal, or variety of playstyle options, or something to make it a little more different from all other city building/survival games. Onbu is great and has interesting mechanics in that sense but it needs to be improved and extended more. It is all somewhat still basic. Worker management and a sense of village still needs to improved as well. Right now game is still lacking on content and features a bit but I feel like it has lots of potential to improve and developers seems passionate about it. So hopefully there will be a lot more updates like Ocean biome to come. I will eagerly wait them at least."

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
This is a wonderfully atmospheric and accessible city-builder where you juggle the needs of your growing village with the usual - managing food, water, housing, health etc - as well as the needs of your enormous animal host, Onbu.

The game sells this symbiosis well, with Onbu moving you onwards from biome to biome; bringing you access to new resources and temperatures, which determine which crops you can grow, the scarcity of water, and the toxicity-levels from (the presumably apocalyptic amounts of) pollution that has reduced the world to the smattering of ruins and nomad tribes left for you to encounter throughout the game.

If you like the atmosphere in , then its heavy influence on this game's design will light a fire in you.

It is well fleshed-out for an Early-Access title, with integrated facility to provide feedback and bug-reports in-game. Its early-access launch content was enough to keep me entertained for a solid week or so, and I can see that growing exponentially as the game increases in complexity with the addition of new biomes, events, stories, and goals. I'm excited to see the project grow, and to check-back after launch to see what's been added!"

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
First of all: not worth $25 in its current state, unless you're really starving for city building/survival content.

It's a chill city builder with a nice twist - riding on the back of a giant ""animal"" in an apocalyptic world which is constantly changing biomes. There isn't super micro managing of your citizens like rimworld or banished. That being said, it's still more hands on than ""plop building down and wait for more resources"". The changing biomes allow for swapping priorities/planning. It comes complete with a tech tree however its nothing to write home about. You can send out scouting parties much like FrostPunk however, the missions are more repetitive and less lore building. Zero late game as its still early Early Access.

TL;DR Promising, relaxed city builder that still requires planning, however due to its lack of current depth is only worth during decent sale."

SDHQ STEAM DECK PERFORMANCE REVIEW:


Follow our curator page for more Steam Deck reviews



The Game Itself:

I want to start by saying that this game is awesome. I have personally been following it for months and it has lived up to my hopes. The game's graphics are colorful and vibrant and the gameplay feels satisfying so far. You build a city on the back of a giant, taking care of not only your people, but the beast as well. This is a city-builder, it doesn't really break many boundaries in that regard, but the addition of developing a trusting relationship the beast you live on is an exciting new element. Now, you have to take care of and develop trust with the monster, or he will rustle his back and destroy...everything...Overall though, I think the game has a lot going for it and I am excited to see where this heads through the Early Access lifepspan.



I was warned by the developers that the game wasn't made with the Steam Deck in mind, though they will be adding in optimization and support over time. I am pleased to say I am not worried as the game runs pretty well on the Deck! For the most part, the game hits 60 FPS and sticks to a 4+ hour battery life. There are really only 3 snags I think come up with the game.

The biggest is controller layout. The game was very obviously made for keyboard and mouse play, which makes sense given the type of game it is. Thanks to Steam Input's versatility though, we created a community controller layout named ""SDHQ Steam Deck V1"". This control scheme maps some necessary inputs around, like using a radial menu with the left trackpad and mapping game speed to the Dpad. You still need to use your mouse cursor, which is mapped to the right analog stick and right trigger to emulate left click as well as the right trackpad for more precise movements.

The other issue is a bit of a framerate drop when the game is loading your village back in after being far away. The game drops to around 30-40 FPS for around 5 seconds, but will then bounce right back up, so it isn't a huge issue. The text is also a bit small, but for a game like this, I would say it is okay, though I would love to see a text-scaling option in the future.

Overall, I was really impressed and super pleased to see how well everything worked out of the box. The Wandering Village also has cloud saves, which are fantastic if you also play on a desktop, and a native Linux build! I expect to be playing this a lot more and look forward to seeing the optimizations and more to make the Steam Deck experience even better."

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Overall this is a great game in a similar vein to Frostpunk and Timberborn. Currently there's a decent amount of content and I ""finished"" the starting difficulty after about 5-6 hours with a final population of just over 100 villagers. I don't have any major gripes with the game and am excited to see what new features are added as the game progresses through early access.

The core game-play loop of keeping your colony content, healthy and fed while also maintaining your relationship with your rock-doggo ""Onbu"" is solid. It feels satisfying when Onbu begins to trust your commands and you can better plan out your colony based on what biomes or events you will run into.

The UI is clean and straightforward, but I do wish there was an ""advanced"" option that gave more insight into historical data for production and consumption of resources. Currently you can view your overall food use/production in the past 24 hours, as well as how many of each resource are currently ""reserved"", but that's about it. The fact that there's no dedicated UI element for water production/consumption is a large oversight in my opinion. Similarly, I think it would be beneficial for there to be more information regarding how long it takes or the specific mechanics of curing poisoned villagers. The game states that villagers will automatically seek aid from doctors, but I found that even with two fully staffed medical stations on opposite ends of my colony, a handful of villagers would just keep working until they died, walking right past idle doctors.

The art style fits the game brilliantly, with the 3D and 2D assets blending together in a cohesive way. The art style is flexible enough to make the game feel both bright and charming at times, while at the same time allowing for the environment to feel threatening and deadly when needed.

The music isn't anything to write home about, but it fits the theme of the game, and helps raise the feeling of anxiety as you pass through dangerous territory. The soundtrack might not be as anxiety inducing as something like Frostpunks, but it matches the game quite well and doesn't feel too repetitive.

Overall, it's a game that feels well rounded and ""complete"". It has a clear direction, and I have certainly enjoyed the available content. I'm excited to see what changes and additions the devs will bring, and will return for a new play-through each update."

This game is a nice little game if you just want to chill out and have quite an enjoyable ride on a big stupid beast. Because it is really, really stupid. Amicable, but boy is it stupid. But let's start at the beginning:
The game basically drops you with a little background story onto Onbu. Further story has not been implemented yet. So you ride this big doofus and try to make your living while satisfying its frankly quite humble needs.
With a catchy nice soundtrack and decent UI the game is entertaining while new research achievements keep you interested in exploring new options. While this is going on, although you have been the nicest you could ever have been to it, Onbu basically chooses to not obey you in the worst possible situations, running directly through every poison cloud and tornado he can find. It's like it's trying to get rid of you, but you hold on, you keep petting it and hope for the best.
The game is not too hard on easy, but you have to prepare for harder times. With mediocre decisions, you can lose and poisoned plants can overwhelm you if you are ill prepared or not reacting quick enough. After all, it was not too hard to progress on easy mode and explore the game in its entirety.

Being in early Access, the game has it's flaws. While some production lines seem very unnessessary (Tree Nursery and Forester, you really don't need that much wood), other resources seem extremely hard to get by (for me it was stone, harvesting spikes and deep mining both hurt Onbu which at some point I really stopped caring about since the imbecile dinosaur doesn't listen anyway). The Onbu Constipator seems useless and just a bad tradeoff in comparison to the Energy Booster. The food pump really does not seem to give you any advantage since it's really not that hard to stack food and mushrooms while just flinging the food into it's kisser improves its mood. These are probably easy-to-fix issues.

After 10 hours on easy mode I came to the point where I discovered all useful research, built everything I wanted, built the endgame milestone and the game had no further objective other to maybe research everything else. So i did that, 5 more hours went by and i am done having seen everything in the game. While having enjoyed the time, that's a bit too little. But it's early access and there's a roadmap, promising some story, better interaction with Onbu and I am really looking forward to it!

After all, I loved my asinine Onbu (even if it didn't love me) and look forward to play it again when it's a bit more polished, since the gameplay was good and fun!

PS: I love my Onbu, no Onbus were harmed in the making of this review. It's a really retarded lizard, though."

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Really neat idea for a management game! Having to take care of Onbu as well as your villagers puts an interesting twist into gameplay.

Pros:
I really enjoyed the toxic plants effect, since it can get out of control very quickly and requires you to make quick, sweeping decisions to control the spread of the infection. Things can get very harrowing very quickly depending on how unlucky you are - I had a toxic plants effect then an earthquake right afterward in the early game which was definitely a fun challenge to recover from. I also never ran into any bugs or performance issues, and the art style is absolutely beautiful and unique.

Cons:
My biggest gripe is that the game could use some balancing. I played on the hardest difficulty and never really had too many issues. The hardest part of the game is getting established within the first 1 - 2 hours. Once you build a couple decontaminators + blie extractor, and get Onbu to like you enough to always listen to your commands, then the game gets pretty easy. Berry collectors/farms are ridiculously productive and I never felt like I was desperate enough to harvest blood or do anything to make Onbu lose trust in my decisions. To challenge myself, I just completely stopped using the hornblower because being able to fully control Onbu's actions is just too OP right now. There's also some sound issues - I noticed that the background music will sometimes just end abruptly rather than smoothly transitioning when you move into a different biome.

Conclusion:
Overall a really unique, well put-together game with a ton of potential. Since the game is early access I'm definitely willing to forgive some of the balance issues, as I'm sure they'll get ironed out."

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
TL:DR: I do enjoy the game, but would recommend it on sale for cheaper than current price, as there isn't enough content to justify $25.


REALLY wish Steam had a Neutral rating for reviews, as this is a perfect example of good and bad all in one. I'd recommend it at a cheaper price due to the lack of content right now.

It took me 10 hours to do after learning everything to play efficiently, but I reached the ""endgame""
Day 290. Endgame? Nope, we must keep walking to survive! 
A Screenshot of The Wandering Village


The Good:
Decent art style - Reminds me of Studio Ghibli. It's a very relaxing look to an otherwise dark game (you are trying to survive the deadly poison plants).

Good Atmosphere - The game presents itself in a manner fit of the art style. It's very nice and works well.

Progression - You can unlock tech at your own pace, but face being left behind if something goes wrong. Some tech requires knowledge obtainable from Shrines with scavenger parties.


The Bad:
Shallow Game-play - It's a very linear game, directing or letting the Onbu walk down two set paths: North and South. You also have a few multi-choice selections for what I'd call 'special events'.

No real goal posts at the moment - Once you unlock everything in the tech tree, you just keep on trucking. There's not really an end to the game per-se, more of when you want it to end.

No real in depth simulation - Everything is extremely cut and dry, with no real dynamic systems in place to alter game-play to a point where it would snap me out of just monitoring my village and Onbu.

There is also no good way for me to see what tasks are being done and what is completed. I wish I had a chart for that stuff without needing to click on every individual. It makes seeing what needs to be done or checking progress much more tedious.

Poison plants can break stone roads, which is all fine and dandy as it stops you from walling off parts of the map from poison plants, but it also forces me to use my resources to fix it every time it happens, and it gets old fast.

You will find it hard to gauge when the Onbu will listen to every command you give it until it starts doing the happy dance and wagging it's tail when you travel. Otherwise it's a guessing game until that point and a gauge to see it would be great.



I'm sure with time it'll turn into a great game, but at this point it's not a game for $25. If it was priced around $10 it'd be a steal.


Edit: Opened up comments as I've now played pretty far into the game and now feel confident in answering questions.I've also started fleshing out the review.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
TL;DR: S'alright. Design issues and lack of content. Will recommend if it improves. I really want it to.



The art is very appealing and the setting is AMAZING with so many unique possibilities. Unfortunately though I can't recommend it. Fair enough I got almost 8 hours out of it but with colony sims I really expect something more. And it wasn't necessarily a memorable 8 hours.

I blew through more or less the whole tech tree and I never really broke a sweat. I played on the normal difficulty and I could switch to a harder difficulty, sure, but I feel like I already saw everything there is to see and it became very repetitive.

Gripes:
-Scavenging is annoying micro management more than interesting decision making
-No reason not to play on max speed
-A lot of the buildings you just toggle on when you need them and toggle off immediately after if you want to play optimally. Or just leave them manned and idle because you can't be bothered anymore.
-Biomes are rather short lived and repetitive
-Biomes don't actually change the way you play. You just switch some crops around if you walk into a desert, and it's sad to see the core premise of a wandering village be solved by three or four mouse clicks once an hour.
-Exclusively the ocean biome has unique tech for it that is only usable in the ocean biome. No other biome is like that. It's weird.
-No events really caused any worry or concern
-Most difficult part of the game was finding a spot to place my big end game decoration
-Nothing shocking or surprising happened in the play through. You know... some dwarf fortress style ""FUN""
-No choices to make a run unique. I guess I can choose to be cruel to the animal or not but regardless I will still need to heal it, cure it and pet it and then harvest it's blood for food variety and it's bile for fighting the poison.

Again, I love the art and setting, there is so much potential. Just needs to work out some design issues and add a lot more content. I am looking forward to changing my review."

PROS
+ cute art style
+ colony on a moving object is refreshing for the genre
+ game makes you adapt e.g. through different biomes
+ easy to learn
+ runs smoothly at all times
+ finite resources does not let you sit in your comfort zone forever
+ you always feel at a lack of manpower which forces you to prioritise

CONS
- bad events are not punishing enough or it's too easy to recover
- too little content for the money
- endgame runs itself. not a challenge anymore
- monument does not do anything albeit being expensive
- lack of depth in general

with a torn heart, I need to give this a negative review, mostly because the game is fun and I like it but for that amount of money other early access games offer more. My minimum requirement for games is each Euro should equate to one hour of fun which I am not sure I had as for most of my 20+ hours the game just ran in the background while I was doing something else on my PC and when everything was running automatically without me needing to put any commands because the colony was built to be able to run itself and recover in the endgame, it lost its appeal.

I know that there is more content coming and I will try it out again. I genuinely hope that it will turn this review into a positive one because I've been waiting for this game so long after playing the demo and always checked the Discord in great anticipation."
the+wandering+village,Not Recommended,10.0,"Posted: April 1
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
The game is fun, but there's some pretty frustrating aspects to it. At the moment, my review is negative, but I intend to change it when more improvements are made.

1. As other reviewers have said, the lack of an overarching goal beyond ""don't die"" isn't doing it for me.
2. Villages die *WAY TOO EASILY*. No food for a few in-game hours? Boom, your population is cut in half. These people have the energy reserves of mayflies. In fact, as far as I can tell (not scientific), being poisoned takes longer to kill them than not eating.
3. I don't like that I can't zoom out to see more of the village without going into the ""See the Onbu"" view. This tripped me up dozens of times when I was trying to apply priorities to harvesting over a wide area.
4. I *hated* having to micro manage harvesting rocks and trees. This is something that should be happening automatically. Either make harvesters at the workpost auto-harvest, or make builders that need stone go get stone, or make stonecutters who are out of stone go get stone. The villagers aren't stupid, they aren't going to sit on their thumbs and say ""Gee, i really need stone, but that rock that i'm looking at hasn't been marked as harvest-able by the village leader, so i guess instead of building the granary that we need to not starve to death, i'll just chill"".
5. I very much did not enjoy having to manually set priorities after setting something to be harvested. Make it a single click-and-drag.
6. Double clicking on something (e.g. poison plants, rocks, trees, so on) should auto select all of the things of that type that are visible on the screen.
7. There is no UI indicator on how much the Onbu trusts the village, major information gap, and the player may not even realize the Onbu isn't following commands like which direction to walk in. Took me 4 times before i even realized.
8. My Onbu decided to sleep in the middle of a toxic storm within 5 minutes of starting the game. Really? That's not OK. The Onbu shouldn't be suicidal. It's one thing for it to refuse to run through something dangerous, it's an entirely different thing to have it literally lay down and take a nap while it's being actively harmed. At worse it should slow down to a crawl, but never sleep.
9. I randomly had my Onbu go from 100 health to 20 health without any kind of UI indication, or explaination. I could not figure out if it was caused by environment damage, or something that I was doing, or what. The game needs to make the health of the Onbu significantly more in-your-face. Any damage at all should cause a noise and UI ping, and lots of damage in a short period of time should force the player to pay attention.
10. My Onbu walked through a thunderstorm, and half of my buildings were destroyed. Unacceptable. Something that took me 20+ minutes of real-world time to put together demolished in under 20 seconds with no warning. I literally shut the game down when this happened because I was forced to go find every building that was destroyed and click ""rebuild"". Buildings need to be able to survive no less than 3 damaging events before being demolished. Add a repair and/or maintainence mechanic to give the player flexibility on ""fix"" verses ""rebuild"". But just demolishing half my buildings, and then requiring several minutes of busy clicking to ask for them to be rebuilt is rage-quit level of bad design.
11. I unlocked huts, an upgrade to tents. I clicked two tents to be demolished to make room for a hut. It took 10 minutes for my villagers to actually demolish the tents, they were apparently off doing who knows what. Demolishing buildings is very short time cost, so it should implicitly be prioritized above other tasks.
12. Allow the player to place buildings over other buildings, with a confirmation box asking if they're sure. I should not have to *first* destroy the existing buildings, wait for the villagers to get around to it, then remember to check back to see if i can place the new building.
13. I absolutely do not like the ""Change out your crops when the Onbu moves to a new biome"" mechanic. If you're going to keep this mechanic, then allow me to set a schedule that tells the villagers what crop to plant in which biome. The player should *NOT* be needing to micromanage this.
14. Kitchen produces 3 polenta for 3 corn. Am I not understanding something about the food mechanic? as far as I can tell, this provides the exact same amount of ""food"" per crop, but by adding 1-3 villager's worth of labor to it. Change it to be like the other crops early, 3->5.
15. I don't like that the Herbalist is it's own stand-alone building, when it's literally just a farm with a different name. The healing herbs should be just a different crop to pick from in the list.
16. Same with the mushrooms. The mycologist should be merged into the farm building.
17. Add dirt crops. One to start the game with, and then another set of researched crops that can be unlocked.
18. I hate the cactus farming mechanic. It's a very labor intensive solution that can be easily worked around by building a crapton of air-wells to tide the village over.
19. Why can't I tap into the Onbu to get water? We can get blood to make blackpudding, but not water?
20. Not being able to rotate buildings is very annoying."

While the current early access game is still fairly short ( it took me 15 hours to get to the current 'end' point, but i like to go slow with games like this) the amount of promise it has makes me excited to see more. I can tell they put a lot of work already in this game. I love the fresh take of a city/survival builder and the need to find and create your own resources through exploration and different world regions on the back of a large friend. Besides the current shortness of the game, my only real complaint so far is the ai of the villagers and onbu, not much of a story, and the lack of a more versatile research tree; but as the studio has already made it clear they will be working on these, i will be content to wait!

the+wandering+village,Recommended,9.0,"Posted: September 16, 2022
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
This game is definitely not finished yet, but it's definitely good. Right now it feels they want to set up ""hard choices"" of helping or hurting the Onbu (giant), Helping or hurting Nomads along the way, and chosing paths (both literal and tech); BUT those choices are sorta of both forced and not important.

For instance, Onbu ""Trust"" is the only stat you DON'T see, and it's also the only thing that seems fickle. I can break the creature trust by hurting it all day, so long as I just Feed and Pet it at the last second before making a request it seems to obey. Meanwhile if I have long ago done nothing but love and never broke it's trust.. it seems to never let me choose which way to turn at crossroads.

Same problem with wandering nomads and decisions for poisoned nomads, etc. Since there is no reputation system, acting like giving medicine or water to them means anything is pointless. They either give me nothing, more people, or I ""roleplay"" that I feel bad that some people might die. I'm never rewarded for helping people out, and never shown consequences for letting everyone die around me.
Now, that being said; mechanically giving them my resources to get more people and things so that my town gets bigger and stronger still works; so THAT part still works. So that game still works in early access. Like I said, the game is set up so long as the developers know it's not finished yet.

The feel of the game is great. The Game Cycles is about dealing with the change of biomes. As your Onbu walks around you need to constantly shift what you grow, what you harvest, and what your scavenge so that you are ahead of the problems. The difficulty is that the hazards ahead get worse and worse the farther you walk, but so do some of the potential bonuses and tech. So you must grow fast enough to take advantage of those things in time to ""win"".

The win is usually when you have out ""teched"" the hazards enough to not worry too much about them. The only problem I had with the game in this is that it was self aware of this problem and so it created a buffer to stop this. Late tech required ""knowledge points"" to complete it. The only want to get this is from random scavenge points on the map. This means RNG can make you wait to do tech. Mix this up with the fact that some resources are only found from scavenge points and you need those for some buildings to build those late tech buildings... and you're stuck playing the game longer than you need to be to ""win"" the game.

TLDR; The game has enough potential for me in just the feel it brings to play recommend it, but it has built in mechanical enforced length. It's only the late, late game; but it still sucks to just wait around for RNG for new things in a game. Buy if you're okay for 10-20 good hours of game while waiting for updates or to support the game. I can definitely see myself playing it a different way in my second/third play through which is a big win for any city builder."

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
What a wonderful little game, a wholesome new spin on city builders! Though a fairly short game as the game technically ""ends"" at day 100 but you can continue to play for what i assume is forever. But despite being relatively short, i have no doubt it will be beefed out throughout development and i cannot wait for what the devs have in store! I have played this on all difficulties and I feel like the difficulties need defining and tuning more. Beginner and intermediate feel the same and the hardest difficulty is only hard until you have 30+ villagers and the main essential buildings researched, the late game seems the same on all modes.

Pros:
. Wonderful immersive music that change in each biome.
. Onbu is adorable and its fun looking after his needs and keeping him safe.
. Good AI
. Very stable game, never encountered any bugs or crashes.
. Outstanding use of 3D and 2D assets resulting in an adorable art style.

Cons:
. Early access always has its risks.
. Relatively short game.
. Fairly easy difficulties.
. Some crops wont be used as much as others as some need very specific biomes that I never seemed to be in that often, so villagers always complain about their diet.
. Sometimes the villagers wont build or harvest something until you make it a priority even if there is a low workload.

Suggestions:
(I understand that some of these might even be in development already)

. Greenhouses so you can grow crops in all biomes.
. Barns/coops and livestock.
. Make difficulties more distinct.
. Villagers age and have kids.
. Schools for kids giving educated villagers boosts.
. The ability to do more with mushrooms (eg. mushroom soup for your villagers)
. Be able to make more foods with a combination of crops (eg. Berry pie: wheat + berrys, tomato & mushroom soup etc)
. More crops (eg. potatoes, onions etc)
. Meet other Onbu and maybe make Onbu caravans were you use balloons for villagers to get from one Onbu to another.
. Bandit raids on your Onbu + a barracks/garrison building for soldiers to defend Onbu.
. More biomes and more varied random encounters.
. The ability to select a villager and order it to do a specific task.
. Graveyards to honour dead villagers.
. Make gaining Onbu's trust harder and make the consequences of upsetting him greater.

That's all i can think of for now but I'm sure ill think or more things :)

A special thank you to everyone involved with this game! <3

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
The art style and premise is very nice, but unfortunately the current research system and lack of progression just kills it for me. The research tree feels like padding at some points, like for example the wheat. You research how to grow wheat, then research how to make flour from wheat, and finally how to bake it. The only use for wheat is to make flour then bread, which is behind 3 research tiers. Then the same happens for mushrooms into onbu food, blood into pudding, saplings into trees. Just odd multi-part research that only leads to 1 product at the end. Unfortunately, it feels more like added padding for time/progression as the research tree feels pretty shallow as is, actually condensing techs that are useless standalone would really show it. A weird gripe but when you spend a majority of the game just sitting on your hands and waiting for a new tech to finish, said tech being pointless makes it feel pointless. As is, do not recommend the game, this feels more like a Demo than an EA game."

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
There isn't much to the storyline itself. The game has been in early access for nearly a year and I bought it on sale. I would've hoped that there was a lot more to the game. I built some building in 13 hours, and maybe 3 gameplays (including the tutorial). Once you get the hang of it, you've already beaten it.
Wait for it to be cheaper -- or wait to see if they make the game better by releasing more for it; questlines, storylines, other survivors and more types of random events. Make zombies or volcanoes or tsunamis happen. I'm on this giant mountain of a creature and we.... walk. Sometimes run. Down pre-aligned paths that literally give you a choice of Northeast or Southeast.
It gets boring and dull fast.
What I do like is that it was a fairly chill game. but I've beaten it. There's no reason to repeat it unless they release more content/ any quests/ natural disasters. Make some of the people zombies.
The game's design is fairly unique and cool, but once you get the hang of it --- you've already beaten it. I hope they do more to the game and really push storyline development or more randomizations. I like the game, but there needs to be more before I encourage others to pay for it."

I've thoroughly enjoyed this game, on my second run through (my first village died quite badly). There's a really nice balance of chill watching your little people scurry about, and stressful trying to grow enough food in the desert or exterminate all the toxic spores laying waste to your berries! The music and especially the sounds of Onbu are great, and it broke my heart to finally give in and build the technology that Onbu doesn't like, but that my people needed to survive. Until the next toxic storm killed a third of them off, that is.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
***The Good***
Concept: Limited-scale city builder played on three layers. 1.) the village, 2.) the onbu, 3.) Interactions with the wider world (onbu's path / biomes / events / scavenging locations)

Art Style: The little 2d animated sprites are adorable, especially because you can zoom down into the village level. Gives it all kind of a whimsical paper-doll look amid the 3d rendering of Onbu itself. The art style was what caught my interest first.

Ongoing Development: Early access games get a bad rap sometimes, I think. This game has a great dev team, and a solid roadmap. I believe that when it's finished, it will be fully worth its price tag.

***The Meh***
Story: Currently nonexistent. There's a little lorebook that explains game mechanics, but no real depth at this stage in development. (More story is planned, however)

Gameplay: Honestly? It's a little thin. Solid for what it is, but once you've figured out a decent priority system, it only takes 1-2 hours to really get rolling. Many colony sims have an early-mid-lategame staging for development, but right now The Wandering Village kind of goes from early to done. There's no real 'endgame.' I hit a point where I had no interest in further research because using the buildings would hurt trust with Onbu, and I was able to survive just fine without them. THAT SAID -- the devs are very communicative, with a clear roadmap.

***Pricing Fairness***
At this stage of development, I probably would have priced this at $20 max, not $25, but bellyaching over $5 on what is clearly a labor of love with a great team behind it seems silly. It's a bit steep but nowhere near robbery. Kind of nice to have a little game like this to boot up now and then."

I think the foundation is solid. If the devs actually deliver to get the game out of early access and support changes I think this can turn into something really great!

Pros:

Interesting Concept.
Growth is Fun.

Cons:
Poison is Unbalanced - I can beat it every time but that takes manually shutting down EVERYTHING I have and tasking everyone individually to harvest away the poison. Really annoying.
No Replay Ability.
Too Expensive - This game, as it sits is worth $15.00 due to lack of replayability and a more fleshed out system.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
I guess my problem is I'm not sure what this game is trying to be. As a city builder/management sim it's really shallow (everything basically boils down to ""what crop am I growing for the next 10 minutes""). There's not really a major story-telling aspect aside from the initial ""world is toxic"" setting. The idea of a city building a symbiotic relationship with this titan (onbu) is a super neat idea, but...

At the same time it's also very shallow. Get a horn, feed it once or twice, and it will basically do most anything you tell it to. And there's no punishment (that i found) for doing the ""anti-onbu"" things aside from it basically ignoring your orders. Which ultimately doesn't really matter, because the city management is shallow enough that minimal planning is needed to prep for the next biome you're entering, and you would likely have had to make those preparations anyway. The only time I actually directed my onbu was when I wanted to figure out what was in a biome I hadn't been in yet. 98% of the time I just let it walk.

If you like simple and soothing city builder games, this game prolly isn't a bad pickup. If you were hoping this had a bit more strategy involved or the relationship with the titan was more impactful, at this point in time (7/24/23) I can't really say you'll have fun with this game. You'll likely be like me and get a handful of hours of trying things out and then be done."

This was a really enjoyable game where not only do you need to watch out for the health of your villagers but also the Onbu in which you are building your settlement on. The art work is so cute and love how the settlement goes 3D when you zoom in. The fact that this is Early Access and runs so well and also room to expand even further. Twitch integration is also a very cute little addition allowing viewers to be named after Nomads and adjust your course when a fork in the road appears. Overall really well done. Very creative, very unique and worth you checking it out."

I love management type games, but this one absolutely infuriated me. Regardless of having many villagers available to build they would just wander around, eat, stand still, and work on the buildings on their own time... WHICH TOOK ABSOLUTE DAYS ON END. I'm sitting there wondering why they're refusing to build one of the main buildings during the tutorial phase when I have all the necessary materials that they just keep storing away occasionally going to pick it up and deposit it into the building I needed finished. Regardless of me setting a specific building to Highest Priority it was ignored. It's a shame, I was looking forward to finally playing this game cuz the style caught my attention, but for now it's a no for me till they get the villagers ai fixed."

Rimworld but super chill.
Not necessarily easy but there's not much systems going on, you don't manage individual villagers, housing is just one house that you build, there's no time schedules, no enemies in fact.
It's just about producing resources, and stocking up for the various harsher bioms which affect your resource production.
Basically the only optimization you can do is building placement, and making stone paths so the villagers walk slightly faster."

OK, do not @ me for this comment but I liked this game in a very different yet similar way as to how I liked Factorio. The hassle isn't there except for a few moment, that's different, but the RP choices are there - allow me to explain - it is optimal to treat Onbu as a beast, feasting upon it and skinning it alive while poking it to go where you want and at the pace of your choosing BUT (and Onbu has a big butt, so) BUT I could also play it friendly and kind and find that Onbu also likes me and the people living on its back. I'll play again once the full game is out and I look forward to more kaiju creatures to live on, maybe ones that are more feisty or sleep in profound hibernation or even one that's looking to mate or find its lost child or parents (?)"

I loooove the concept of the game and how it looks.
I did buy this thinking it would be a cosy city builder, which isn't my experience with it (for now, maybe I'm still figuring it out, idk)

I do have some feedback considering this game is in early access:
- Please let me zoom out so I can see the whole village without going to Onbu view
- I would prefer it if stonecutters that need stone would gather their stone , it makes more sense to me then them just waiting for someone else to do it
- For some reason demolishing doesn't seem to work? it takes ages
- Please add the option to rotate buildings ':)
- Can i get a screen with an overview of all the villagers tasks (and the option to change their priority, maybe drag them in the right order?). I feel like they never listen to what I ask them to do & keep wondering what the h*ll they are doing then, but can't check
- I feel like the toxic plants reproduce way to fast for how slow the villagers walk

I'll be adding to this review while playing.
From what I have seen the dev's are working hard on improving things & they listen to the feedback (which is why I am writing this).
It's a fun game, I would totally recommend buying it on sale!"

What can I say? It's great. The concept is charming, the gameplay does it justice, and it doesn't feel like an Early Access game at all.

I love how the *wandering* aspects solves one of the biggest issues of other city builders, where you don't have much to do once you stabilise your economy. Because the creature enters different biomes you constantly need to re-adjust, shift your resourcers, etc. and it keeps the playthrough active.

Can't wait to see how it develops further, because it's more than promising and already very playable."

The Wandering Village

has a really nice style for a Strategy-Survival Game and a nice concept with its theme in which Players right away start on the Back of a Giant Creature that, like the Title of the Game already gives away, wanders around.
And with the Change of the Creatures Position there comes also changes to the Environment the Villagers will find themselfs in and the Players has to help them to survive by building and harvesting various different Things.
Also the Creature that carries the Villagers arround require the Players attention from time to time.

The Tutorial is well made and easaly leads Players into this Game and how it works.
With different Houses, Technology, Research and assignable Jobs for Villagers, there is a high variety on how to prepare or fight against challenges that the Changes of the climate, cold, hot, swampy, etc, will throw against the Player.

The best Part of this Game is its nice and, even if its survival, still relaxing and enjoyable theme. If you want to just lean back for a while you can play on normal Speed, or if it isnt fast enough there are sliders to speed up the tempo to force events to happen more early. Even an implemented difficulty Setting helps to get a more preferred Gameworld.
And for sure the best Part are the interactions with the giant Creature. At the Beginning just a low amount, but over the course of a Game the relationship between the Villagers and the Creature lead to more options like letting it know when it can safely rest or to feed it or healing it etc.

For this Game i will not count negatives at the moment, because it is still in an Early Access state.

So far tho i can say, that i am already impressed by it and i am looking forward to future updates in the hope that they implement even more Biomes and Buildings and Gameplay-Options.

I recommend this Game to People who like to enjoy chillig Strategy-Survival Games and who also love simple Graphic, but still artistic style.

---------------------------------
8,7 / 10 graphics (Nice choice to go that 2D Drawing Style in a 3D World, it really gives it a nice artistic touch)
8,5 / 10 Gameplay (Easy to get into the Game)
6,4 / 10 Story (The Main-Story is good so far, but i would like to see a little more sidequests and unique Side-Character Stories to tell a bite more about the World they life in)
7,4 / 10 City-Management and variety of Buildings (City Management is easy, the Building variety maybe a little bit low, but that is likely to Early Access state and i hope they increase the amount of possible Buildings)
4,2 / 10 Soundtrack (There are a few Tracks, but for the Playtime it takes for one Playthrough i would like to hear a higher variety of Tracks to not getting the same over and over)"

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Quick review: Buy it, awesome and pretty welcoming gameplay mechanics combined with an interesting concept for the ""movement around the map"", a great difficulty curve and a quite nice visual artstyle. It lacks a little bit of ""objectives"" if you want to ""complete"" the game.

Extended review: The wandering village is a pretty straight forward ""City Builder""/""Colony management"" game that takes some concepts from the genre that usually are ""static"" and by putting you in the back of one ""definetively small beast"" turns them into something more dynamic while adding some extra mechanics to the ""management core"" of the game. You can expect an absolutely beautiful visual stlye and art direction as well as nice sound design.

The learning curve is pretty welcoming and you can expect some extra depth to it that you might think at first, I kind of dislike the idea of having to survive ""for as long as you can"" instead of having an exact objective, but that's just a personal taste there's nothing wrong with it. In my case I plan on playing until I unlock everything in hopes that there's some kind of ending after that.

The game has a lot of content for an ""early access"" and a lot of polish to be honest, if they are just planning on expanding the game and adding more features with this level of polish I'll be quite happy with it.

The price might seem high for a ""non complete"" game, but at the moment I think it is woth it.

In case you want to check some footage of the game here you have some:

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
it's a lovely start to what I see being an amazing game as the developers continue to improve it. currently, there's not a lot to do however this is what you sign up for when you buy a game during early access. the animations of Onbu are well done and the game is gorgeous. graphics and visual appeal is something this game has down and I can't complain at all.

this is an early access game so in the spirit of that, I'd like to add the things I wish were in the game or changes i think would be beneficial. I'd like to see a better balancing system. food runs out very quickly, and the poison plants spread too rapidly to be combated quickly. when poison plants appear I have been wiped out quite quickly as they spread fast enough that I cannot create enough medicine to cure the poisoned villagers. in turn, this creates a chain reaction of them all dying. I would put this as a lack of my own skill but given the other mentions of this issue, I think it would be a good idea to make the poison plants more manageable to balance gameplay. I would also love to see more of an animation when the buildings are destroyed due to earthquakes or tornados. overall the game is very charming but as a more personal request, I wish there was a little bit of a story. I thought there would be one with how you could explore to places that said they held artifacts but was a little disappointed to learn there was no story. although that is understandable considering that was never promised. I do however think it would definitely add to the game to have little goals to work towards."

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
I have just a little under an hour played with this game and overall I have enjoyed it. It is an unique city/base builder that is done in a cute art style.

The major uniqueness to the game play is that instead of seasons coming and going, your creature (Onbu) walks through different regions that have different biomes, thus subjecting your villagers to different weather. Along the way a blight will occasionally infect your trees, bushes, villagers and so on. This blight if it hits you early on can spread quicker that you can contain it if you aren't prepared, as I clearly was not during my first game. I still may be able to pull through but it isn't looking good.

Another unique part is that you can somewhat control the Onbu by having it potentially changing it's direction on the world map. You can zoom out and see various paths, sometimes ahead you might see the possibility for new villagers or possible dangers. Even though you can try to influence the Onbu, from what I gather it is not a given, just a possibility.

All in all the game performed great on an aging i5-7400 @3Ghz run 16GB Ram, 1060GTX and Samsung SSD. I experience no crashes or bugs during my playtime. That's always a plus even more so with a EA game that released not too long ago. For the price I do recommend it for fans of the City Building genre.

It is Steam Deck verified, I haven't tried it yet on the SD, but I will do so and report back on how it runs on said platform. That being said, I am not a fan of running RTS type games on the deck and prefer good old mouse and keyboard. That said it is nice to see it is a SD Verified game."

Lack of content. What you need to do is just build all the buildings. How do you place your buildings only make a small difference. The path the dragon go does not affect much, but it makes you need to replant all the crops. Or sometime destory all your buildings and make you to repair them. It is not fun but jut annoying. In fact, most of the thing you do in the game is not challenging nor relaxing, only repetitive."

Onbu may be life, but Onbu is also death.
I was feeding Onbu, petting him as often as it would let me, not harvesting his blood but he still never trusted me. He refused to run through a huge poisonous forest and decided to sleep through an immediately subsequent poison cloud storm. I know, right? He killed 20+ villagers by long exposing them to poisons. I had full doctor/herbs going. In response to my requests to walk/run, Onbu leveled half of my village. I was on the easiest setting. Cute game."

I already played many hours on the Demo and Beta Testing Build.
For an Early Access game, it already has a lot to offer, from many things to research, build, and discover, to many events that you need to carefully plan and manage from the map.
The interesting thing about this game is the titular *wandering* village. Your village is built on the back of an adorable gentle giant who just wants to wander, eat and sleep. As residents hitching a ride on its back, your fate depends of it as much as its depends on you. While it provides a place to live, wandering in different biomes for you to explore, it relies on you to feed, keep it healthy, and guide it. But be careful! If you harm it too much, it will lose all trust in you and try to shake you off! You key is to live in harmony!"

I've really enjoyed this game. It's fun and relaxing, plus the little customer storylines are adorable. I got it while I've been sick so I've been playing it to keep myself occupied and it's a great way to lose track of time.

I've almost completely upgraded the shop and unlocked all stickers, only have a few customer stories left. I'd love to see further improvements to the game...

- Additional sticker options ! especially words and faces
- Improved creator options ! like overlaying, cropping, masking, etc
- Being able to create / include thank you notes in packages
- More customer stories ! or just different customer interactions in general
- Continued interaction with customers from stories ! don't they like my stickers anymore ? :c
- Being able to feature stickers in the store with tags like ""new"" and ""bestseller""
- Being able to put stickers on sale, or discount them
- Sorting options within the sticker drawer when filling packages (and maybe the store as well?), after you make 30+ stickers it can be a bit bothersome to scroll through to find what you're looking for, the ability to sort them into categories for better organization would be lovely
- The addition of a sticker outline on printer sheets ! I can't see the white portions of stickers on the white paper, which can make arranging stickers on the sheet kind of annoying, so knowing where the white parts are would be nice

All in all a lovely game that I hope to see more for / from ! :D"

A super relaxing cozy game where you can design and create as many stickers as you want - using the various templates etc you can purchase from the in-game shop (currency comes in the form of coins and hearts you get from sending stickers out to customers).

As an IRL sticker collector I thoroughly enjoy this game, however there is a feature I would love to see added:

A sticker book, so that when you delete stickers to either make space or make more profit, your old designs aren't completely lost and you can just glance through the book to see your old designs etc.

Other than that I really do enjoy the game, and I hope to see more added to the game - possibly with more achievements and character stories involved?

Also, really love the fact you can save the stickers you create in-game onto your own desktop as transparent files. I'll be printing mine off eventually to decorate my laptop at some point!

I wish there was an undo button for making stickers and a better way to grab sticker when they're placed, because a lot of the time when your crafting and have multiple stickers down its really super hard to get control of a specific sticker, and to fix the issue you have to move every sticker you placed out of the way so you can grab the one you want to fix.

Overall feeling: recommend. Great storytelling, really cozy and fun for the first 4-ish hours, but gets monotonous and lacks replayability.

---

I really enjoyed the first 4-5 hours of this game! The main gameplay loop of designing, printing, and packaging gets addictive quickly, and getting to experience customer stories through this small-business-owner format was lovely and kept me wanting to play more and more. The storytelling aspect is great - the customers are a diverse bunch of creatures, Really Cute, and with lovely stories that add to the charm of the game. The art style is GORGEOUS (although Really Bright), and the sticker customization is genuinely so fun. It's collage based, so there's no pressure to be a ""good artist"", it's just fun.

However, without the aesthetics or the storytelling, the core gameplay loop was just... kind of bland. It does a great job at being a relaxing past time, but has zero challenge or anything that inspires long-term progression, really. There's no ""numbers go up woo"" chase that's typically present in job simulator games: your income / number of customers / overall work experience is basically the same in end-game as in the beginning, so there's no external motivation to make more stickers. There is barely any challenge other than sometimes running low on money and having to postpone printing a sheet of stickers until tomorrow (which is really not how operating a small business is irl, but I get that the game is trying to go for cozy over realistic). There's nothing to strategize about, almost nothing to improve or optimize, and the only goal keeping me playing past hour 5 was getting all the achievements (which is unfortunately really tedious). So, once the stories end and you get bored of simply making cute pixel collages for the fun of it, there is not much motivating you to play more.

Honestly, considering the simplicity of the core gameplay loop, the lack of challenge and business progression, and the fact that storytelling was the main driver to keep me playing, this is probably a better interactive visual novel rather than a true small business simulator.

Despite this, I liked Sticky Business. I still recommend this game, but with a few ""buts"". This game is AWESOME if you need to spend a zero-stress cozy evening making collage stickers and roleplaying as an online art store owner. The storytelling is cute, and getting to know your customers is lovely. You can easily sink several hours getting lost in designing new stickers. However, when the stories end, for a lot of people the game will probably get boring quickly, and there's kind of no reason to replay unless you're really into designing aspect.

good game! its a really good chill game to relax to and its interesting to see how peoples stories will go! the sticker editor is amazing and you can make some cool stuff.

however, for a game that focus's on stickers and making them wow is the assembling system bare bones, its fine but you are only allowed to choose from 3 sizes, flip and rotate. there is no free deform that would allow you to manually change the size to the desired effect, this is really needed as most of the pride stickers are massive so if you wanna use em for a background or even bend em a lil you cant and they stick out like a sore thumb or the 3 sizes you can choose from are too small or just dont fit. this could be fixed with a magic wand tool that maps textures into other shapes example, mapping the trans flag into a circle template shape. it would also 10x's increase the amount of stickers you have in your toolbox

you dont have a flat square ground so you cant make much environment wise only a small half round which sucks. you cant edit already made stickers by yourself so if you make one mistake and only notice when its done you have to scrap it and completely remake it. this is an actual joke in a sticker MAKER game.

if the devs push out an update or few they should really focus on adding more manipulations to making stickers as its pretty clunky to figure out.

Sticky Business is an utterly adorable, relaxing, and addictive game about operating a sticker shop. Everything about it is astonishingly wholesome and although its gameplay eventually becomes monotonous, the positives far outweigh the negatives. Despite its theme occupying somewhat of a niche corner, there is a lot of fun to be had, and I hope to see a sequel, or DLC in the near future.

Pros
Wholesome aesthetic
Addictive & easy gameplay
Every small task is made fun & with adorable animations
A range of brief, generally uplifting stories for each customer.
Encourages creativity, but does not shun those who lack it
Cons
Monotonous achievements involving intense grinding to buy all upgrades/stickers
The simple premise loses its spark after a few hours, providing no longevity

If you would like to see more reviews written by me, please follow my curator page and help support my work Cookie Reviews.

Sticky Business encompasses such a simplified concept, yet I have not seen anything even remotely similar done so masterfully. Despite its slightly suspicious sounding name, the game is the definition of everything CUTE. It encourages inclusivity, wholesomeness and of course, a love of stickers.

There is no main story, but there are mini stories told through short paragraphs on returning customers. Gameplay is all about managing your very own sticker shop. Buy stickers from an enormous, ever-growing collection. Design your own sticker by combining designs from a monumental collection to create something truly unique. Print your stickers, customise your online shop and of course, pack and post the sticker orders! Every task you do takes up time. Once the day is over, you will be forced to sleep and start the next day. I never felt any time pressure and never experienced a late order, however if this concept sounds worrying to you, there is also an option to make the day speed “limitless.”



Sticky Business’s interface is exceptionally user-friendly and extremely easy to navigate. Not to mention that every click feels like a hit of dopamine with a cuteness overload of colours and animations. This is difficult to explain, but even printing stickers made me feel so accomplished, the matching ding sound only added to this. Making these mundane tasks fun and addictive is a success on its own. Pack the orders how you see fit. Upgrade your packing paper and filling to confetti colours, polka dots or your favourite colour. Add in a freebie sticker or sweet to make that customers day. Pack the stickers and send it off with a click. Earn money and hearts from successful orders to buy more upgrades. Add more slots to your online shop, buy different sticker paper to print stickers on, new designs and so much more.



Customers will order specific sticker designs based on what is available in your online shop. Some clients will be connected to one of the branching stories and their order will come with a small bubble of text to read. The text typically relates to their personal situation and why they are ordering the stickers. It often will also reference a request for more stickers from a different theme, such as dinosaurs, space, animals or so forth. Creating stickers that encompass these themes will allow that character’s story to progress, and they will come back the next day or so, purchasing those new stickers, and with the next section of their story to read. All conversations are kept within easy reach and can be re-read at any time.



As aforementioned, one of my favourite elements about the game is its promotion of creativity, to make unique, artsy designs, yet it is also OK if you do not… and the game will not punish you. Want to chuck three types of stickers together and call it a day? You can! Want to create the most perfect bouquet of flowers, with a matching starry background where every colour perfectly compliments each other and the angle of each sticker is flawlessly identical? You can! I would not call myself a creative person, but I adore this game. After seeing some of the examples of stickers from other players, I realised the games true potential. Works of art can be produced here, but if that is not your style, that is fine too. The stories progress based on the *types* of stickers used, not how cleverly you place them together. Of course, thoughtfulness and effort is encouraged, given the pure arrangement of stickers to choose from, but it is nice that progression is not restricted to this.


The noticeable downside to this game’s simple premise, is this. The gameplay does become rather stale when repeated, which is to be expected with a game of this nature. My main gripe is the grindy achievements that force this. If you do not care for achievements, the four or so hours of gameplay will likely satisfy you, but for completionists, the achievements can turn this fun game into a bit of a slog. Even for those not interested in achievements, after the main stories are completed, you have most likely upgraded everything to perfection, and without new character stories coming in, there is little to keep you interested. Given the very reasonable price of $AU14.50, I believe this to be a fair trade off, well-worth the enjoyment I had. But for those looking for more of a long-term game, it is important to be aware of.


Visuals are bright, blocky, and reminded me of the Myspace era. The overabundance of vibrant colour is an attack on the eyes, but in the best way possible. Stickers are obnoxiously cute and ooze the cozy games aesthetic.



The backing audio is nothing unique, but helps create a relaxing environment. Despite this sounding trivial, those dopamine-giving dings and clicks I described earlier also play a vital role in the game and help make every task an absolute joy to complete.


4 hours (I 100% completed all stories, but not the completionists achievements).

No

Not really.

Sticky Business is a reminder that even the most simple-sounding premise can provide pure entertainment – if done correctly. It is a testament for the many simulation-based games that have not been able to master such a niche theme. This is not a game that will appeal to the masses, but if anything you have read in my review even somewhat intrigues you, you are likely to enjoy this game and I encourage you to give it a try."

I decided the play this to try and unwind before bed the other day because I did not have the brain power to play something complex, but wasn't tired enough to sleep yet.

Close to 3 hours later I needed to FORCE myself to go to bed cause this game is just so chill and cozy I did not want to stop playing. If you like chill vibe games like Unpacking or Dorfromantik this is for you.

I have a special thank you sheet of stickers to put one in each purchase as well as a couple freebies.
Playing this game is kinda like watching those chill 'packing your order' videos.

Just be aware there are some time limits and deadlines, they don't seem to affect anything I know aside from the potential to fail an order. I haven't had any negative effects from not fulfilling an order yet aside from feeling bad I wasn't able to send cute stickers their way.

Keep an eye on your ingame messages / social media. You'll get hints on what kind of stickers people are interested in and making a correct one will get you a new customer the next day.

So come chill out and get down to some sticky business.

Oh and point blank if your aren't LGBTQ+ friendly this game is not for you."

I have only played this game for 5 or so hours (as of right now, many more to come) and I have already started my own sticker business to sell stickers to my friends and family. This game inspired me to finally start one of my longest dreams and goals (I even used the name for my sticker store in the game as my name for my irl store!). The designs in the game are so my style and I have used this game as a point of reference for many of my compositions for my stickers! I thank the devs for sticking (hehe) to their goals with this game and inspiring artists like me to become more expressive and creative with their art! Thank you so much!"

Thoughts:

Im not sure if the developer(s) use neopronouns, but seeing the inclusion of the neopronoun flag personally made me so happy! I'm a neo and xeno user with many pronouns and genders that are fluid (currently a genderfluff wolfboy and using he/they/bark/woof!)

I started playing this game as I soon as a bought it, and the next thing I know I'm on day 25!!! Its so cute and I love all the stories. Also the addition of the ADHD and autism flag... I myself have audhd and it has great representation! ADHD is often viewed as just being energetic and not paying attention/caring, but in reality one of the worse symptoms is the memory problems!

A game with plenty of representation both within the stories and the stickers. Perfect for the queer folks who just want a cozy little game <3"

Sticky Business Review: Crafting Cozy Creativity

You know, the idea of running a small business may sound like a recipe for stress, but imagine the joy of designing products and sending them off to excited customers. That's the delightful essence of Sticky Business, a charming simulation game that lets you step into the shoes of a small business owner, in this case, running your own sticker shop with all the creative freedom in the world.

Crafted by the German indie studio Spellgarden Games, Sticky Business is a cozy and adorable simulator where you venture into the world of online entrepreneurship. Your mission: create unique designs, handle orders, package products, and send them off to eagerly awaiting customers. The gameplay isn't overly complex, but it's surprisingly engaging and kept me entertained in unexpected ways.

Once you dive in, you'll find yourself settling into a comfortable routine. Each day brings a set number of hours, and every task consumes a chunk of your precious time. After the tutorial and creating your first sticker (a cat in a coffee cup, in my case), you'll slip into a pleasing rhythm of order fulfillment, posting, and squeezing in some time at the end of the day for new designs or restocking. You can even toss in freebies like extra stickers or sweets, though I couldn't quite tell if this boosted order numbers.

As you progress in Sticky Business, fulfilling orders and collecting hearts unlocks more design assets. These hearts also double as currency for buying additional colors to jazz up your designs. The thrill of acquiring upgrades, especially early on when you must choose your design components carefully, opens doors to new creative possibilities.

Sticky Business does offer some light business and management sim elements, but its core charm lies in creativity rather than gameplay complexity. It's the perfect game for unwinding. However, if you're after a deep business simulation, it might leave you wanting more.

But don't let that fool you; there's a story here. Customer orders are sprinkled with messages that offer glimpses into their lives. From a grieving family to someone seeking new friendships, these short but emotional insights enrich the game.

Sometimes, customers will request special stickers to progress their stories, sparking inspiration for fresh creations you might not have considered otherwise. I found myself diving into the store to purchase new sticker upgrades more than once, responding to these unique demands. The requests aren't overly detailed, usually centered around a vague theme rather than strict specifications, but they nudge you to step out of your comfort zone and create something new.

One area Sticky Business could improve is customization beyond stickers. While you can control elements like the paper and filling for order boxes, having more say over your workspace and online store front would be a welcome addition. In such a creative game, it feels like a missed opportunity not to have more control. Sure, you can change your shop's color, but you can't set your own prices or layout, which can sometimes mean you're selling a sticker for just a few coins.

Visually, the in-game graphics are adorable. The work surface is a pastel paradise adorned with plants and coffee cups. The stickers themselves sport a cute and cartoony style that's reminiscent of clip art, but they're charming enough to convince me to buy a few.

The one drawback for me was the music. While cheerful, it became a tad repetitive, eventually prompting me to switch to my own tunes.

In the grand scheme of things, Sticky Business might not be a sprawling game with countless tasks. It's repetitive, offering just a handful of activities. But you know what? It's a joyful and fun experience, tailor-made for anyone who enjoys cozy, relaxing games. From its cute graphics and cheerful music to the freedom to create without fear of judgment, Sticky Business is the perfect way to unwind without a care in the world."

""A simple, comfy and wholesome game with cute small stories about the customers and their lives.""
Sticky Business allows for a fair amount of creativity in the creation of stickers and then selling it. I enjoyed it greatly, and before I knew it, I was 2 hours into the game despite the game being incredibly simple; make the sticker, print the sticker, and sell the sticker.


Plot 5/5
Sticky Business does not have a plot or story behind yourself, and why you started a sticker business, but as you sell and make new products, you get to hear about the lives of a few regular customers. Some of these regulars know each other, and you can hear the perspectives of each customer on their lives. All of these stories are wholesome and engaging. Hearing about the customers made me happy, and some customers even make suggestions of what they'd like to see in the store. I would drop everything I was doing to make their sticker desires come true even though they were predetermined messages.
I loved seeing the stories between the customers, and seeing their happy reactions to the stickers that I made. While there was not much plot, or anything that could really be considered plot, the mini stories and interactions with customers that I did experience, I fully enjoyed it.

The controls of this game are relatively simple, which makes it easy to pick up, however there is nothing further to it, without any challenges, quests or progression, which could make a player lose interest and get bored.

I did also find that there lacked explanations in some aspects in the tutorial of gameplay, for example: How do you get hearts? What does candy do? What happens if you add extra stickers to an order? When is the due date of an order? What are all of the icons in the day summary screen?

These were all questions I had while playing the game, and I did just end up having to guess or figure it out myself by testing it. The lack of explanation left for many things to be desired, but I acknowledge the possibility that I may have just missed the tutorial or explanation for said things.

While the game did have many options and possibilities to customise your stickers and packaging, which I enjoyed greatly, I think some further additions would also be good. The ability to create your own text for stickers rather than just the set ones, and further website customisability for your store are things I would love to see added in the future.

The art is adorable, plenty of splashes of colour in every screen, making it aesthetically pleasing. I enjoyed the art for both the UI and the stickers.

Sticky Business has relatively simple background music, and much to my surprise I did not find myself getting sick of the music even after 7 hours into one sitting. The sound design on notifications, clicks, selecting items and etc. were also very fun and satisfying to listen to when performing actions, which I liked. It did not stand out as incredible, but the audio in Sticky Business was good.

I do believe that Sticky Business is not the most replayable game, as the main engagement for me was the mini stories of the regulars, and after completing the stories, there aren't any further communications from them. This makes the gameplay rather repetitive. I found that once I finished all the stories, and had all the upgrades, I got bored very quickly.

I do believe that it may be good once in a while to open up to make some cute stickers and package some orders, but it is not something I would play frequently and enjoy for lengthy periods of time after finishing it.

I quite enjoyed Sticky Business, it was visually pleasing and aesthetic, accompanied with cute and satisfying sound design. The small stories of customers were engaging and wholesome. There was a fair amount of freedom in the creativity aspect of creating stickers, but of course there could also be more, such as being able to draw your own features or adding your own text. I did, however find that the game lacked any progression, which makes the gameplay rather bland after a period time, as well as replayability after completing all of the mini stories of customers, and some explanations of certain features in the tutorial. However, I enjoyed Sticky Business and consider it to be a wholesome and relaxing game to pick up."

as long as you don't go in expecting a management type of game then you should have a good time. this game is all about designing stickers and is more about creativity and self-expression than really growing a business. there are some cute little customer stories sprinkled in for fun, too. it does take a little while to get the last few achievements for unlocking every item but is overall very chill."

I wish you could see the stickers in a drawer or something, rather than on a scrolling bar. When you have many sticker designs, it becomes tedious going back and forth."

If you like quaint, casual games that help you relax and de-stress, then this is the game for you. Sticky Business is an artistic catalyst and is enchanting in small ways. You can grind and fast track the completion of the game, which I did in under 11 hours. There were plenty of inclusive upgrades and stickers as well. Once I started playing this game, I couldn't help but 100% in one go. It's addicting and the backstories from the customers were humorous to me. The editing of the stickers were easy to use and follow. Being able to customize your business's website was also a more immersive touch. This game was definitely worth the purchase."

I enjoy the concept of this game and the art style. However, after playing for a bit, it got really repetitive, and I no longer had any motivation to create more stickers. I wish there were mini objectives/challenges to complete. Perhaps there could be customer satisfaction bar where we need to adjust our packaging or types of stickers based on customer reviews. Overall, I didn't hate the game, just really simple."

I just found this game randomly and I -had- to have it. You have a small sticker business and you design them, print them out, and send them off to customers. It's so cute and a great creative outlet. I'm enjoying all the icons there are for the stickers and the inclusivity!!! Not only do they have LGBTQIA+ icons, but they have mental health ones as well. This makes it so enjoyable and I might be able to save some for real life application, they just put a watermark over it. All in all, really fun game so far. I did a week ingame. The tutorial is pretty good, had no issues other than not realizing I needed to put more than 1 sticker in the package. The coin options are a bit pricey, but it just means I'll have that much more time to play the game. Would recommend if you like small relaxing games. The price was a bit less than I thought it would be, pleasantly surprised. I also love that you can have a limitless mode so you can actually relax and aren't timed. I think this is great as-is, but if they add more things to it.. it'd just make it that much better."

🌟 Sticky business is one of those games where you don't know what you're getting into. 🎮 What starts as a simple sticker designer tool 🖌️ quickly turns into a heartwarming little simulator clearly made with a lot of love. ❤️

What I really enjoyed about it was the way the stories flowed flawlessly one into the other 📖 and of course, the numerous ways I could create and then recreate my many, many stickers. 🌈🦄

This game helped me a lot during hard times, especially when I wanted to be left alone, hidden from the world. 🌍 It showed me cute tiny little animals and plants 🐾🌱, and made me realize that the world isn't as bleak as it might seem. 🌞

I love it. Absolutely adorable. 😍

I love this game a lot. I've even ordered some sticker paper so I can print out my designs. It's got some very light business sim elements to it and you can unlock new components to use to make more stickers. I'm glad there are some game-y aspects and that it's not just a design tool -- not that there would be anything wrong with that. Although it might not be enough for those who are looking for a more in-depth sim game. The sticker editor is very simple and easy to use and fun to play with. Definitely recommended!"

I DON'T HATE THIS GAME, I JUST CANT RECOMMEND IT IN THE STATE ITS IN RIGHT NOW.


I have been looking forward to this game for a while so I was very pleased when it first came out. Beautiful graphics and lovely music, despite the music looping it doesn't get repetitive, unfortunately, i cant say the same about the game as a whole. Great concept for a game, make your own sticker business, it has great LGBTQ+ representation but i feel like its lacking a lot in the little things that would really polish this game. I have nothing wrong with the stories they're wholesome and cute, it's mostly with the layout of the game and some parts that feel really clunky.

When you have created your first sticker you need to print it off, printing costs depending on the type of sticker you're making, E.G Paper, holo, card etc.. When arranging your sticker on the paper you can either do it manually or click and have the game auto fit it. I have found that the game isn't very good at this?? there as been times where its not let me complete a page despite there being enough room at the bottom for another row, that causes me to have to come in and manually do it which isn't a problem just a nit pick. The actual problems I have though is that you cant organise your stickers, or your printer sheets. I would have loved for there to be a small folder system where you can categorise your stickers in the packing menu and or the printing menu. I am tired of scrolling looking for stickers when I have upwards of 50 designs. I know some people might disagree with me and say ""it's more clicking"" but i would rather it that way, it stresses me out not being able to organise my stickers, if I had my own files I could have exclusive freebie stickers, pride stickers, animal stickers and so on. As of now its a mess and I get drained having to look for everything. Even if you didn't want to add a file system being able to click on the requested stickers via the customers order to have them be put in automatically would be a great help. I love love love the packing peanuts and packing paper, the sweets are also a great addition however I feel like i am always constantly forgetting the sweets exist. The buttons to swap tabs are at the top of the screen near your stickers so i find myself ignoring it most of the time to prioritise the stickers. Maybe if it was swapped to the bottom it would be easier to see but that might just be a me thing.
It would also be a great edition to include custom thank you cards! they could be unlocked mid game rather than right at the start, i think it would include more personality to the game and makes your orders unique and personalised.
When printing new stickers there should be a little pop up which tells you what stickers are low in stock. I don't have the best short term memory so i end up forgetting what stickers i need to print and waste money printing wrong ones. I would really benefit from a ""Low in stock"" menu, even when packing your stickers having them glow red when they are low in stock would defo help me remember more, and instead of removing them entirely from the stock when they do run out, grey them out. I get tired looking for a sticker because its just disappeared when its ran out.


When creating stickers you should be able to have certain elements have boarders and some that do not. I feel like most of my stickers look stupid with white boarders when only a small bit needs them. Also being able to select the type of paper you'd like to use BEFORE finalising the sticker would be great. I always find myself forgetting about the other types.
Also small small smalllll thing... LET US DRAW!!! I WANT TO DRAW MY OWN STICKERS!!!!! it doesn't have to be a mandatory feature to progress but as an artist i would love to have the ability to create completely custom stickers to sell to my clients.

Here are a few other small issues that don't really need a paragraph but are worth mentioning
Maybe add more music? the music now is fine and relaxing but it would be nice to have different sound tracks or being able to unlock different music, you could do that via upgrades and equip it by clicking a casset player maybe? or a record player, for a record player the vinyls could have unique decals on for different tracks.

When packing your orders the button PACK is very similar to the word BACK i find myself accidentally clicking this instead of the home button which makes me prematurely send my order leading it to be incomplete. Possibly changing it to a check mark would help a lot more.


very small thing that might just be a me problem but i struggle to understand how to gain hearts, it feels very random despite me always adding 75%+ to an order ( loads of freebies) i find myself making 0 hearts a day and i am unable to gain more stickers due to this. I also understand the coins are profit based rather than money as a whole but it would be helpful to see how that money is calculated i.e
Printing = -30
sales = 200
profit = 170
Total money = 170
just so it makes sense and you're able to see where your money is going, a little similar to how stardew shows you what sold for what when using the overnight sale bin.
When unlocking clients @Curry was a mystery on how to get, maybe when you haven't met the customer it should tell you what you need to complete in order to unlock them E.g @curry is unlocked after finishing @Miss honeys story line. It's just the small things that would make this game so much better..

for possible replay-ability the devs could host sticker contests which would encourage people to replay the game after completetion.

I took my time with this game but it can easily be completed in 3hrs or less if you speed run it. I think if it gets frequent updates / holiday updates it will be a thriving game but as of now it is very bare bones.


Like i said i don't hate this game, I've played 5 hours and i will defo intend to play more if these small things are worked on. If you enjoy a peaceful relaxing game then id say go for it, but at the same time don't expect any organisation with your stickers, it will get very tedious after a few hours.

this game is overwhelmingly repetitive and the reward system is very limited, also the options for your actual stickers are little to none no matter how much time you spend on a sticker or resources you use the price barely varies which makes it seem like your hard work is wasted. the story lines are very short yet sometimes are challenging to complete which i like. some of the actual game complainants are glitchy and the game itself is not very rewarding, theres no price variation between elements so once you have purchased the limited items you want your money will just rack up, even your own website page seems like an after thought as there are basically n options on howto customize it. the game seems very rushed and under developed and marketed even though release was pushed back. i feel like they should expand their team to create a full game worth the price tag. once this game gets more updates and developments im sure itll be great to play :)"

I'm having an absolute blase with this game. It's so simple yet charming. Bonus points for being able to download the stickers onto your computer so you can print them yourself! Very relaxing and calms me down whenever I'm stressed or just need a minute to myself.

Suggestion for the future:
allow a paint/draw option for even more customization opportunities!"

As someone who actually have real live experience in this field (Artist alley stuff) I love how pretty accurate the depiction of the process esp. giving freebies in form of extra sticker and candies. Wholesome AF, the designs combines with each other well aesthetically during ""Create"" process. Plus, the ability to export the design into png files so the players can print it for realsies is a neat feature. If only real-life small sticker business can be this nice and supportive ;w;b

There's no end goal. This game is a cute idea but all you really use your coins for is buying more stickers to sell. I think it would improve the whole- boring - part if you added something to save for. Like for example: you are trying to get a pet and you need to pay for treats, cat trees, costumes, food) or even youre trying to buy furniture for your apartment or save for a new place. Also being able to design advertisements for your store just like you design your own stickers! i think thats a cool idea. Its a solid 2-3 stars in my opinion. I've played worse games but this is just unbearable to play after a while and it was pretty expensive when its not worth it."

I MAKE BUBBER DUCKY STICKERS WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

This game is one of my favorite, relaxing games ever. It's so creative with so many options to make the coolest stickers ever. I do wish there was an edit button but other than that it is so AWESOME. You can customize your shop, make up your name, create stickers with many color options, and even choose different papers and packaging for the shipping boxes. Absolutely marvelous game and I love it to death."

While the game is very cute and has some fun stories to read, the game very quickly becomes repetitive. There really isn't much gameplay to do. I just about 100% the game in just 10 hrs (until my save was deleted ugh), those 10 hrs include time i accidentally left my game running while afk, realistically it probably took me 5 hrs. The stickers are really fun and cute to play around with, but by my tenth sticker I was kind of running out of ideas. The game is essentially: make sticker, print stickers, package, send, sleep. Nothing more."

NOTE:
The below review was my initial negative review for this game prior to updates. I have since played the update put in by the devs and recommend this game, as the issues indicated below have been addressed. Game is simple, wholesome, and can be extensive, depending on your creativity and energy for detail/personalisation. Still missing a few features but collectively a good indie game.

At 60ish minutes played, I reviewed this game as positive. I am changing my review to negative as, at 6 hours, I am entirely sick of this game. 100%ing it is needlessly time-consuming as upgrading everything takes forever. My eyes burn and I can't adjust the brightness. I am so sick of the exact same song on repeat. I can barely customise my shop and I am now getting 2-3 customers a day, if I'm lucky, which has massively slowed down the process.

This game is cute, simple, wholesome fun. Initially, I enjoyed it. However, the longevity of it just does not exist. This may not be an issue, except the devs put in achievements which require you to play much longer than completing the stories will realistically take, and I am bored. The game needs additional features, ranging from accessibility to customisation. It needs to bump up the cash/hearts you gather as you work, as it is a slog to unlock everything. There should be a loadout option so I don't need to select the same colour combo for my packaging every single day. As well, there is NO sorting option on the stickers- if you create enough (and why wouldn't you, with an excess of options) you will be scrolling back and forth hunting for them every order. There's no indication on the printing page of the stock you have, which turns printing stickers into a memory game (spoiler: not fun). The time restriction each day feels restrictive, too, and could stand to be longer.

All in all, I do technically recommend this game. It's sweet and simple, it does what it's trying to do. However, as an actual , with achievements which require you to play for an extended period (beyond any story motivators) it is exhausting me and I will not pick it up again once I've completed it. Which is a shame.

With some updates- which the community are begging for, and the devs surely cannot ignore- I would change my review to positive."

This game is addictivly fun! it's so simple yet so satisfying. i love that i can save my sticker designs to look at later.

i would love for the developer to add more ability to customize the selling page, past the 6 colors and 4 designs, but i love that there is even that much. I'd love for an ability to customize the desk, printer exct. I really hope they add more sticker options and designs. I'd also love for them to have achievements for 5 staring each sticker componet set.
there is so much already but so much more that can be added. if the devs decide to make a part 2 to this game i will definatly be buying it!!

its soothing to put weird bits together to make something and i love the stupid or silly or ... other type names i give the stickers, it's be quite the source of fun and stress relief which i've despriately needed lately."

I just started to play this game and almost completed all the stories.
I really love pixel art and something cozy.

Pros
- Cute pixelart, visually very pleasing I love it!
- You can be creative making your own stickers
- Easy to understand and very simple
- There's a story!


- It becomes very repetitive and at some rate boring, Just take some breaks!
- Even though you can create your own stickers you still have a limited option.
Examples: You can change the colour of the outline of the stickers and some stickers shapes, but not the image of the sticker itself. There's also a limited colour palette you can choose from.

Do I think this game is worth it? Yes, It's cute, it's simple. Nothing really to complain about."
sitcky+business,Recommended,4.3,"Posted: November 15
Cute and pleasant but a little lacking in some respects. The core gameplay loop feels less like it's rewarding your progress with more sticker components and more like it's artificially gating them to limit your output?

The packing section has some cute options but does not accurately reflect how a small seller would ship stickers. You're not going to ship three stickers in a big box with packing peanuts.

The writing is middling to weak; every storyline is predictable and leans into self-indulgence. The streamer complaining about getting flamed for switching to playing Cozy Games had me rolling my eyes. Every conflict is resolved by buying your stickers, somehow.

Everything is on trend for something billing itself as a ""Wholesome Game"" so I guess you're getting exactly what you expect. It's fine, and I've had some fun making stickers, but it's made no lasting impression. At time of writing I've played two sessions of it. I expect to get 1-2 more out of it before I put this away and forget about it entirely. If Steam let you answer ""Do you recommend this game?"" with a big shrug emoji this review would be marked that way, instead of Positive."

Bei diesem niedlichen Spiel kann man seiner Kreativität beim Gestalten eigener Sticker freien Lauf lassen. Durch das Verkaufen der Sticker erhält man schließlich Geld und Herzen, um unter anderem neue Gestaltungsmöglichkeiten wie Motive und Schriftfarben zu erhalten. Mir persönlich macht es sehr viel Spaß mit den vielfältigen Motiven hübsche Sticker zu entwerfen. Zudem ist es unglaublich entspannend und erholsam, wenn man einen stressigen Tag hatte.

while the demo was enjoyable, and i liked how creative you could be and that you had an unlimited amount of stickers you can make, i bought the full game and was pretty disappointed. gives you very limited materials to work with and you have to buy your way up to actually have some little amount of creative freedom. overrall maybe its somebodys cup of tea, but not mine. worth maybe 3 bucks to me at most..."

I was super excited about this game since I played the demo and I was so not disappointed! I loved what they expanded on from the demo and just how unique and creative you can get when making stickers. I might be close to being done with the stories in the game, but I can definitely see myself staying around just to create even more stickers.

Edit: Finished the stories, and enjoyed every single one of them! I'm definitely going to keep playing, I mean I still have so many slots for stickers to fill and even then I might replace them with even better ones! The possibilities in this game are almost endless!"

Are you looking for a cozy, fun, low-pressure game to help you wake up gently, fall asleep calmly, or just help take your mind off the horror that is the capitalist hellscape that we live in? Then look no further, Sticky Business is the game for you!!

I am absolutely obsessed with this game. I’m not the most visually creative person in the world, but I absolutely ADORE how easy and fun it is to create cute, cozy stickers. The music is a bit repetitive, but it’s also pleasant so I don’t mind that so much because it allows me to disassociate while I make cute little stickers featuring frogs and ducks. I love the aesthetic of this game too - lots of animals, bright colors, a great variety of items to make stickers with.

I absolutely recommend this game for anyone who wants a chill way to get those creative juices flowing - even if you’re not very visually creative ;)"

the sticker creator is very cute and fun, and has a lot of options. a bit too many in my opinion since getting the all stickers achievement is pretty... tedious. i find after the novelty of this game runs out that is what it becomes. tedious. profits are pretty slow even further into the game, making getting all the achievements feel like a chore. i did enjoy the little stories and stuff, but after id say the first two hours the gameplay got old. because of this i dont think its worth the price. 5 dollars an hour is... not great. i stopped caring about what i made or how things are put and just started to fill out orders as quick as possible. not fun.

im honestly on the fence of if i would recommend it or not. if there was a middleground or a ""buy it when it is on 50% off"" option i would pick that. because its so cute and the lgbt themes and stuff i want to recommend it but i cant justify doing that for the amount of ""fun time"" i got out of it. i dont see much replay value either.

i felt prone to stagnation in this game, i ran out of ideas and basically was just remaking the same thing for stickers. even with so many options it didnt give me any inspiration. you can make funny combinations and stuff but that wears off quickly too. plus some of the stories are unclear on how to start them. i enjoyed it for a little while but i cannot recommend it personally."

I am not a twitch streamer by any means but the twitch integration is so fun. I'll go live on twitch for my friends while we're on discord & they all scramble to order stickers before the time runs out. Very cute way to create community engagement"

I played the demo of this game when it released and fell in love with it. I didn't realise I could love it even more once the complete game came out! Not only is it super easy to understand and navigate but it's also wonderfully inclusive. The pride flag section has so many options for gender, sexuality and even disability pride flags that are all up top date and have obviously had research gone into having the correct flag. Not only is the sticker options inclusive but there is even a whole story line and achievement revolving around ADHD which I adored. The graphics are super cozy and the animation of the stickers if you design them to be glittery, shiny or even out of cardboard is beautiful. I cannot recommend this game enough, especially when it's at an affordable price. I could spend hours on hours playing this game and I cannot give my appreciation to the game's designers and team for how well thought out every aspect of the game is. One thing I would like to see though in a game update is being able to change the colours of every sticker you buy other than the clouds, hearts etc, e.g. the animals or gamer sticker. No glitches, smooth game okay that is fun and that never gets boring. 12/10 stars"

I enjoy the concept of this game and the art style but its fun for about 30-60 minutes, then it just gets repetitive and boring. There is little to no satisfaction in completing things. I wish there were mini challenges or something to complete. Perhaps there could be customer satisfaction bar where we need to adjust our packaging or types of stickers based on customer reviews. Maybe being able to get bad reviews would put a spin to it as well, cuz noone only gets good reviews for a shop. Overall, I didn't hate the game, its just really simple and not for me. The game is essentially: make sticker, print stickers, package, send, sleep. Nothing more.

It's cute and it's calming so long as you weren't expecting too much in the way of making original pieces. It's mostly clip art.

As someone who creates art often, I found this game to be quaint & relaxing at first. Though as I tried to play through the sticker creation process I found myself having trouble. I kept feeling completely stone-walled when trying to create new ideas. Some things I would recommend in an update for the developer. And if these thing are already incorporated make them potentially easier to find or give more hope that they will be coming or available as you progress through the game. Either through xp gain or purchasing in the shop.

- Have individual sticker components have their own sticker boarder sliders to control the their width
- Have the ability to change the colors on simple pre-made stickers (like the plants) People are intuitive, they can make anything given the right silhouette of a shape.
- Have a pen to draw fine lines with. What really drew me to this game was the rocket in that gradient night sky. I was so disappointed when I found out I couldn't make my own gradient. Let alone tweak the one provided to be a different color.
- Have sticker components scale disproportionately. I would have loved to make a lot of things, had I not found that the objects I was working with only grew and shrank keeping their aspect ratio. I would have loved to have a really long arrow. Or perhaps an oval instead of a circle. I found I couldn't make shapes or patterns that I wanted because I couldn't edit the size of some objects to my liking.

I can get behind buying new colors, shapes & pre-made stickers in the base shop. It gives you something to work towards. But as an artist I feel like every trick I tried to incorporate to make this the best experience possible got stone-walled. These things were missing, or the settings that were already in place were lacking. I felt as though all that was left to do was put the pre-made pixel art together. Like forcing a square peg into a round hole."

Quack. 🦆

This is less a game and more of an experience. No, you cannot control the ducks. But you CAN watch them. And by watching them, you can witness SO MUCH.

One of my ducks had babies which it promptly abandoned. Another duck stabbed a Flamingo pool floaty and it deflated. Another duck went around the pond so fast that it JETTISONED ITSELF INTO THE OCEAN and disappeared over the horizon, forever. I cried.

It's like a soap opera. With rubber ducks. You never know what's going to happen next.

I streamed this game and narrated the events for five hours. Every time the duck bar began to fill toward a new duck, chat would chant, ""DUCK IMMINENT"". When I was done I immediately bought the DLC. A bunch of my friends bought the game and began gifting it to friends. I already can't wait to play again and check out the new ducks in the DLC.

I hope that the creators continue to create new ducks and features, because they're onto a real ducking winner of a game here."

Two ducks arrived at my pool, one of wood and one of cloth. They began as strangers, but at time went by and the breeze in the summer sky changed, so did their circumstances; they were blown towards each other and it was love at first sight. They floated together for ages, rarely straying from one another. Even when they were apart, they always ended up reuniting with one another in a beautiful display of petroleum passion; things were perfect.

But then came another, one with a burning hatred for the life of lonliness he led. For though the pool was a world of joy and love, he felt none. Enraged, he began pursuing the two lovers, determined to make them feel the same pain that he had known for his isolated existance.

He set the wooden duck ablaze, the fire burning with the intensity of the jealousy of the relationship he yearned for, but could never have. It took only moments for the cloth duck to notice that their partner NAY, their very purpose of creation burning in agony and crying out to them. The cloth duck rushed to help, only to be ignited by the same destructive flames that now consumed the wooden one.

But neither would dare leave each other. for without one, the other could never be whole. So instead, they endured the pain, gazing into each other's eyes. Through the pain they felt as their plastic flesh became scorched, they endured. For the pain of living apart would be far worse than that of the flames.

They still float together, their dedication to each other brighter than even the most intense pool light, never to be snuffed out.

tl;dr 2 highly flammable ducks are inseparable for some reason and the lava duck hates them for it


and that was my first experience with these ducks. God I love them so much! 10/10 would recommend

Edit: apparently the firefighter duck hates them too; it has been staring at them burning and seems to actively avoid extinguishing them"

No words can even begin to express the beauty and complexion of this game. No, this is no game, this is a masterpiece. My review could never dream to do any justice for this simple masterpiece, but I shall continue forward in my writing. Not a second goes by where I am not running this game, time is simply too finite, too short, to achieve this games fullest potential. ""What if no one else stays by this game eternally?!"" ""What if no one reaches the maximum amount of ducks on the map at one?!"" These are questions I have asked myself, these are the questions that have driven me to push forward on my mission. When my computer is open, I must have Placid Plastic Duck Simulator open, even if my computer grows to a heat close to that of the sun when I have 5 other games open, I must continue to run Placid Plastic Duck Simulator, for who else will. It is not only for the fact that no one else may run this game for eternity, but also for the mysteries, that I run this game. What is the meaning of the door, is it related to the chalkboard duck from the More Ducks DLC in any way? If the Ski Duck from Quacking on the Ice (DLC) can be unthawed when the campfire is lit, can the ice of the hockey rink be thawed as well to release the yeti duck. Despite both of these ideas being very unlikely, they still both drive me to let the game run, as letting the game run is the only way to experience any special event. I still can't believe how unknown a game so paradoxically colossal yet simple as this is. It is the best game ever known to man, and consequentially the most underrated as well."

Very intense gameplay. Such in depth character backstories, I forgot this was a game about ducks the more I played.
That final boss fight was absolutely insane, it took so much grinding for me to finally beat the boss. After countless days of grinding to get every duck, finally I noticed the boss starting to falter. At first it was subtle, I noticed the ducks moving slower, more jolty if you will. Then as I built my army to be even stronger, the boss got weaker, slower still the ducks moved until finally finally it happened. Placid Plastic Duck Simulator.exe has stopped responding. It was done, the final boss couldn't take it anymore. It had given up.

Now to do it all again with each DLC, no such things as too many ducks"

You literately watch ducks float around and be ducks. The only complaint is that you cant nudge them around when they escape. I REALLY want to be able to save them. Dev PLEASE!

Chilli con carne recipe

if you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding Chilli con carne recipe you've come to the right place,

Ingredients

1 large onion
1 red pepper
2 garlic cloves
1 tbsp oil
1 heaped tsp hot chilli powder (or 1 level tbsp if you only have mild)

1 tsp paprika
1 tsp ground cumin
500g lean minced beef
1 beef stock cube
400g can chopped tomatoes
½ tsp dried marjoram
1 tsp sugar (or add a thumbnail-sized piece of dark chocolate along with the beans instead, see tip)

2 tbsp tomato purée
410g can red kidney beans
plain boiled long grain rice, to serve
soured cream, to serve

Directions

STEP 1
Prepare your vegetables. Chop 1 large onion into small dice, about 5mm square. The easiest way to do this is to cut the onion in half from root to tip, peel it and slice each half into thick matchsticks lengthways, not quite cutting all the way to the root end so they are still held together. Slice across the matchsticks into neat dice.

STEP 2
Cut 1 red pepper in half lengthways, remove stalk and wash the seeds away, then chop. Peel and finely chop 2 garlic cloves.

STEP 3
Start cooking. Put your pan on the hob over a medium heat. Add 1 tbsp oil and leave it for 1-2 minutes until hot (a little longer for an electric hob).

STEP 4
Add the onion and cook, stirring fairly frequently, for about 5 minutes, or until the onion is soft, squidgy and slightly translucent.

STEP 5
Tip in the garlic, red pepper, 1 heaped tsp hot chilli powder or 1 level tbsp mild chilli powder, 1 tsp paprika and 1 tsp ground cumin.

STEP 6
Give it a good stir, then leave it to cook for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.

STEP 7
Brown 500g lean minced beef. Turn the heat up a bit, add the meat to the pan and break it up with your spoon or spatula. The mix should sizzle a bit when you add the mince.

STEP 8
Keep stirring and prodding for at least 5 minutes, until all the mince is in uniform, mince-sized lumps and there are no more pink bits. Make sure you keep the heat hot enough for the meat to fry and become brown, rather than just stew.

STEP 9
Make the sauce. Crumble 1 beef stock cube into 300ml hot water. Pour this into the pan with the mince mixture.


info.
This great chilli recipe has to be one of the best dishes to serve to friends for a casual get-together. An easy sharing favourite that uses up storecupboard ingredients.

It’s cold. It should be cold, but I can’t feel anything. A flurry of snow rains down around me as I slide across a frozen pool.

A Zamboni without a driver pushes past me, moving the others to the gondola lift. I do not know if it chose to ignore me or if it just missed. I don’t think I’ll ever know.

There’s a lot of things I’ll never know. Who I am, for example. I know what I am, but I don’t know what I look like. I’m a duck, a rubber duck to be exact. The others are too—they slide past me, sometimes float past me, if we’re in water—and they wear all sorts of colors and designs.

All I know for certain is that I quack sometimes, seemingly at random. I can’t control it; it just happens.

I don’t think the others are aware, like I am. I think I’m the only one who’s really here. In a sense, I’m alone...and yet I’m not.

Someone else is here. It’s not one of the ducks. It’s something else entirely, a different sort of entity. They’ve never done anything to any of us, but I sense their presence. I know they’re here. I can feel them. But all they do is watch.

Am I happy with this life? I can’t say. I can’t remember anything else. As far as I know, I’ve always been a rubber duck.

It could be worse. Some of the others catch fire. Some of them fly off the mountain, never to be seen again. I’ve even seen one explode. Me? I just float endlessly, without a care in the world. Nothing to do. No need for food. For money.

But it could be better. If there was just one other duck here, aware, like I am... Would that be better? Would it be better to have someone like me, even if we couldn’t communicate? I guess I’ll never know.

It’s getting dark. Darker than nighttime, that is. So dark that I can’t see, not even the warm glow of fire that is always burning. But this is normal.

The other presence fades. The ducks remain.

I am alone."

MY RATING: 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 ✘ ✘ ✘ 7 / 10

I was actually going to say that the game is kinda totally useless. But then I can't do that, because somehow I've grown to love the very different rubber duckies and that wouldn't be entirely fair to the rubber duckies either.
So let's just agree on conditionally useful. That sounds a lot nicer too.

Somehow the game is also funny, even if you can't do anything but watch the rubber duckies splashing around and unfortunately also when they burn or melt in the sun.

Yes, you heard that right, no ♥♥♥♥. and I didn't think at first that the game would be too unforgiving to me.


I don't know if a hint from the developer would not have been bad. I mean,

But apart from this shocking experience, the game is also good as a screensaver or as a GPU burn-in test.
Since there are no settings for graphics options / performance, depending on the GPU model, the computer can take off or you have the feeling of sitting next to a jet plane. In this case I can only recommend you to set the FPS to 30 via the graphics card settings. That's enough, protects the GPU as well as your ears and nerves.

If you want to run the game in window mode, you can define your own resolution in the game's start options (Library, right mouse button > Proberties under General).
All you have to do is enter e.g. -screen-width 1200 -screen-height 720, or of course the resolution you want and you're done. After the game starts, just press ALT+Enter and voila, windowed mode.

Apart from the screen saver option, the game offers 15 achievements that all work and unlock themselves and are also counted in the statistics.
So the only thing you have to do is start the game, wait and watch the ducks splash, or not. As you wish. I would like to briefly point out the burning rubber ducky again because, yes, I think you know what I mean...

And what is perhaps still missing for perfect bathing happiness are the trading cards that one or the other would like to have. Time will tell if we can still get them. I hope there won't be a burning rubber ducky on it...

So let's hold on:
If you would like to have a few more achievements and a perfect game, are looking for a new screensaver or maybe want to see the burning rubber ducky, you will certainly not go wrong with the game.
Everyone else can save it.

Have fun 💖






✅ funny to watch

Placid Plastic Duck

 It would be greatly appreciated if you would rate this review with a prize, although it is not necessary. If you want to read more reviews like this follow me as a mentor. If you want to discuss the reviews and talk to other people in my Steam group. The links:  My Mentor Page   My Group Page  

This game is a misunderstood gem that currently needs to get the recognition it deserves.

But you may wonder, why is it supposedly so good? Well, then I will answer your question. Placid Plastic Duck is about some ducks in a swimming pool and it's true, this may seem very boring, but that would only be judging a book by its cover.

In the game you start with a duck in the pool, you will not be able to move it, since it moves by itself and you will only be able to see it from outside or get in the first person, after a while every few minutes another duck will arrive and another and another... Until you have more ducks than days in the sun.

In Placid Plastic Duck you can fulfill your fantasy of having a gigantic number of ducks, being able to have them of different rarities, patterns and colors, in addition to the fact that there are some that can interact with each other and this not only happens with the ducks from the base game, but also with those of the dlcs.

As an experienced player with all the achievements I have witnessed many interactions, there is a duck with a candle that can burn an ice cube to unlock an easter duck (sorry for the joke) and yes, you read that right, there are SECRET ducks, there are several ducks that They can be obtained in the normal map and other secrets that are from the other dlc map, like these there are many interactions, such as a ninja duck that you have to find hidden or a duck that has to capture a ghost duck on camera.

Placid Plastic Duck are not just ducks, they are THE ducks you want to have, you have many types and each one can be more or less to your liking, this game accompanied by its own music can help you relax while you study or finish a job, this game , is what YOU NEED."

Have you ever wanted to do nothing? Well now you can! Even better yet, have you wanted to do nothing, but WITH rubber duckies of various suits and unique cosmetics? Well the waits over folks, now you can literally sit there and do nothing but watch little duckies float around in a relaxing environment and quack your little heart out.
Not to even get you started on achievements, good gracious. You earn achievements on the FLY by doing NOTHING. (Aka... NOTHING) All the achievements I've gotten thus far, I have not a dang clue when i get them.
Various events can take place depending on what ducks you have on hand. I got an achievement for getting a floaty popped by the pool. Do I know how? Heck no i don't, why? Cuz I was doing NOTHING.
Now even YOU can do nothing by yourself or with friends ONLINE! This game is nuts and I live for it. Its great for making you sleepy, or for those moods that you have no clue what game you wanna play. Just watch DUCKS!!
Even includes some nice background music to enjoy, however it does have some questionable ones, mainly on the first level where the relaxing music turns to either 1 of 2 odd tracks. 1 being just a lotta Spanish outta nowhere. The other being a deep voice also speaking some not-English language.
We always got youtube if the music is less desired.
GO WATCH YOU SOME DUCK!"

In total I spent $8 on this game, And I do not regret it.

When I first got this game I thought it was a very simple game: collect a few ducks float around and that's it. however as my ducks slowly grew larger and larger and I acquired more and more. I then started looking around and realized that this world of the Ducks that we choose to be a part of is more than just some plastic ducks floating on a pool. It was a Great Awakening of sorts and I have devoted my time and effort to obtaining every duck physically possible. I never thought that they'll be such Connections in this game that take a spiritual and deeper meaning into oneself and the understanding that the Ducks are the reason we are all here today and that without the Placid plastic ducks I would have never experienced such greatness such as exploding ducks, fire ducks, burning ducks, Ducks being put out by other ducks, ducks flying and getting themselves stuck in a place that I didn't even know was possible, and of course duck. With that being said, What I originally thought was a waste of $8 was $8 well spent."

Very relaxing game! Never knew how much I needed a plastic duck simulator.
However, my ducks are very bad at operating the slide. They keep ending up beached on the grass, or slowly swimming into the horizon and never returning. One is also stuck in the bottom of the pool.
Do not take this as criticism, I think it just adds some flavor! Though I would not complain about a patch so my ducks don't keep disappearing."

This game has, frankly, changed my outlook on life. I went from simply existing in my world, taking everything for granted and letting life pass me by, too actually stopping and observing what was going on around me. The grass blowing in the wind, the local wildlife as they go about living life. I watched them live a lifestyle I had long forgotten about. One of enjoyment and tranquillity. One I still, deep down, longed for. This game helped me not only come to this understanding, but come this much closer to actually experiencing it. This game has absolutely changed my outlook on life for the better, and I have preached this game to everybody I know like gospel. Needless to say, this game is a 10/10. I cannot thank the developers of this game nearly enough for the amazing experience they have crafted. Please buy this game for yourself and everybody you know. I promise you will not regret it."

This game is a social commentary on our modern day lifestyle, the sheer contrast between constantly working weeks on end with no time to relax and a plastic duck floating endlessly, without any danger whatsoever, however, they are trapped in the confines of the pool, try as they might to escape, A mysterious force drags them back to the depths of the pools along with every other duck that manifests periodically. Overall this game is a fantastic game for people who enjoy philosophy. 10/10

Ducks, ducks, ducks. (Played on Steam Deck)

While there have been a lot of idle games, where the goal is essentially to watch the game play it self for you, Placid Plastic Duck Simulator is somewhat one of a kind.
It quite literally requires no action by the player, just sit there, and watch ducks. Oh hey another duck spawned. Oh this one has a propeller hat, look at him go fly away ducky!
There is nothing to really excuse my hrs on record playing the game, but I would say for the price, fantastic thing to have in the background while you work on other tasks, the chill beats, the ambient sounds, the random quacks as the camera zips from duck to duck, all with unique designs that make them appealing to watch float in your pool.
Oh there he goes down the slide, that is adorable!
Calling this a game is somewhat unfair, as its not trying to be. Almost all the achievements require no action from the player, nor is the player able to do anything other than move from spot to spot. Leave the game on long enough, and your achievement list will be full sooner or later.
The pool areas that are available are very beautiful, with lots of hidden details and random events that occur on both, somewhat guaranteeing you entertainment every time you glance back at the duck pool.
Oh my duck just got abducted by aliens. And they replaced it with an alien duck. Neat.

There is not really a point to anything you do here, and you can get some added dlc that is also very cheap, and has a lovely ammount of ducks, with unique mechanics and attention to detail leaving me satisfied with the pricing. But they do add up eventually in cost.
There is also the issue of lack of settings, the resolution being changed does not really help lower end systems, and having too many ducks can prove for a very lag filled experience, without the ability to lower the settings to compensate.
With the unlocked ability to mess with the radio, I was also hoping for some more music variety, but I was sad to find out not really much else.
Some of the dlc has added some more active achievements, but they do not add up to much more than clicking on stuff. There are also some hidden... lore bits? Alternate reality game hints? That were fun to figure out, and I got a cool new duck for it!

Overall, It is a very fun idle experience to check back on while doing other things, the duck designs are fantastic, the interactions between them and the environment are full of attention to detail, with only a few minor flaws. Wonderful execution of the interactive screen saver concept."

Not really sure how to describe it.

I like to have it playing on my second monitor while working, every so often when I feel need a small break I like to grab something to eat/drink and just check on my ducks.

The Christmas update was also fantastic. I loved streaming it to my living room TV while I decorated.

I defs didn't expect anything more than the base game, but the DLCs have been a great surprise.
Also the price, on all of it, is so worth it."

Still did not get the last Achievement. It is soooooo mean.
Writing a Review.

That was exactly my Gaming Experience with this….ehm…. Game.
Lets face the true. This is more a Screensaver then a Game.
But it is, what it said on the Salepage.
And every promise fulfilled!
Nothing more, nothing less.
Take your Time, watch the really cute different Plastic Ducks falling into the Pool, enjoy the Music, enjoy Day and Night and go crazy with that damn, mean, hard, AAAAAAAAARGHHHH extinguish fire Achievement.



But be happy with such a heartwarming Simulator.

Thank you for reading and what are you waiting for? Jump into the Pool for just 1,59!!! That is cheaper then your local swimming pool!!"

Never have I witnessed such raw emotion and such diverse story lines in one game. I saw a submarine duck reach his wildest dreams, chug out into the ocean, and sink into the abyssal depths of eternity. I witnessed an 8/10 180° backslide done by a fire-breathing dragon duck. Haven't seen a move like that done in my 69 years. I even lived the tragedy of a psychedelic hypno duck get blasted out of the pool and under the slide, never to return....except in my next game when he returned as a zombie duck. My cowduck got abducted by aliens...Good times.

Also I named a red duck ""BloodClotHorrorDuck"" .. So there's that.

10/10 would buy all 4 DLC's again......."

Placid Plastic Duck Simulator is honestly a game that I have found a lot of comfort in. Though it may seem to be a boring game about rubber ducks just floating around, it is game full of love, calming music, beautiful graphics, and silly little ducks. The game is perfect to put on in the background while you study, work, draw, or really do anything. I find it very stress reliving and great for calming down especially when you have problems with mental health. Looking at these silly ducks floating around brings a sense of peace and makes all your worries float away. I truly couldn't recommend this game more."

Explaining Plastic Duck SIm in one sentence: It's a real-time screensaver.

There's more to it than that, but that is the very basic essence of it. There are mini events that randomly occur; planes fly by, curious little UFOs appear to steal a duck away into the night (this literally happened in the background as I was writing this section, thanks game), inflatable pool decorations get popped or knocked in depending on what your ducks do as they float around.

It is absolutely something you put on in the background/a second monitor, or if you want to have passive entertainment while doing something else. I fell asleep with it running, and as someone who has sleeping problems, it was nice to look over after a routine night of randomly waking up from poor sleep to see the ducks still bein' ducks without a care in the world, drifting around on my monitor.

Also a UFO came back and spat out a completely unrelated duck while I was typing this. Not sure what to make of that.

The music in the game is nice, although there's not a lot of it. You have probably ~20-30 minutes of music from the in-game radio that will loop. It's very good, but there isn't enough of it, even though it absolutely fits that mellow vibe of ""yeah, the rest of the world kinda sucks, but we're just ducks enjoying what we got.""

If you have an anxiety disorder, I can absolutely see this helping."

OK, jokes and memey reviews aside, this game is legitimately really good for its price point. Based on the title and ""beginning"" of the game, you may think it's what it advertises itself as- a silly, funny little premise that you'll play for about half an hour and then get bored of. However, there are so many little events, secrets easter eggs, and interactions between the different types of Ducks that it's kind of amazing. Even outside of making up your own little stories and plots about what your Ducks do, there's still so much this game has to offer.

The music and graphics are also surprisingly great for how cheap the game is, and even without the DLC there are plenty of Ducks to scratch that itch to complete your collection. Yeah, you can always just AFK and leave the game running, but then you miss out on all out of nowhere things that can happen like"

I dunno, man.
I really, REALLY tried to like this game, gave it plenty of time, tried everything it has to offer. I was so excited when I saw it was being developed!
Sadly, it’s just not a fishing game. More like an exploration game with fishing elements where the fishing feels more like an afterthought than the core.
My experience was as follows:

- I decided to log my 2-hour (120 minute) gaming session according to what activity I was doing within the game. I was completing challenge missions on the mission board. The challenges were fishing challenges, but they all required the player to reach or find a specific location. End result: time I spent walking/driving/finding the right spots on the map: 100 minutes. Time I spend fishing: 20 minutes.

- The maps are very large and you are expected to travel to lookout towers in order to unlock markers for locations on your map, then travel to said markers in order to “discover” the locations. The problem, is, while this works perfectly for theHunter, it’s extremely annoying in the Angler. Why? Because in theHunter, walking is what you’re supposed to do. You walk slowly from location to location and hunt while doing it. It’s exciting and gives the player a logical route to take. But the Angler is a fishing game. So walking and driving only takes away from fishing because it’s not like I’m gonna find some random fish in the middle of the road. Most of the missions in the game are 90% traveling and 10% fishing. A lot of the missions (especially in the Norway map) contain no fishing at all.

- The game lacks purely fishing related missions. I finished them all very quickly and then I was left with nothing to do except many tedious flower collecting missions etc...

- The traveling itself is very slow and frustrating. The cars are buggy and you can’t reach many map locations with a car to begin with. Walking is slow, extremely time-consuming and boring.

- It takes a long time to unlock locations on the map, but not all unlocked locations give you a fast travel point. I can’t understand why this is. Every single waterbody etc. should be a fast travel point as the player gains nothing from making multiple walking trips to the same location.

- The game runs pretty bad. I can run TheHunter 70+ fps on ultra graphics, this runs barely 25-30 fps on medium-low. My rig is well above the recommended specs.

- The game crashes a lot. About once every 30 minutes or so.

- The credit/xp system is needlessly complicated. There are literal conspiracy theories on how it actually works because no-one seems to know for sure. What’s wrong with getting a bit of credits/xp for each fish? Just adjust fish worth according to size/rarity etc. The current system is just weird makes fishing feel less rewarding.

- It makes no sense to have a level/xp system in the game if there are no skills to unlock or level requirements for gear. What’s the point?

- The gear is needlessly complicated also. There should be some sort of assistance in pairing rods/reels/lines as the current system leads to people wasting credits on parts that should fit the rest of the gear but just...won’t. The leveling of gear is also a mess similar to the main xp/credit system.

- Tedious inventory restrictions. The player can carry 5 rods and 5 reels with himself at all times but there’s no space for bread crumbs in his pocket if he also carries a selection of different hooks. Have the devs ever heard of a tackle box? (And yes, they come in bigger sizes.) This doubles down on the missing fast travel spots in it’s tiresomeness. Let’s say your mission is to go to a specific spot. Only after you reach said spot will you be told what kind of fish you need to catch. Not carrying the exact tackle you need? You have to fast travel back to the shop to access your storage, and then walk all the way back to the mission spot because there’s no fast travel location anywhere near. Just… why? I really really hope tackle boxes and storage boxes aren’t a problem the devs invented on purpose just to offer paid DLC as a solution later.

- The achievements in the game downright discourage fishing. Most of the achievements revolve around exploration, points of interest, collectibles, you name it. The actual fishing related ones are easy and fast to get. It would have been nice to get some long-term fishing achievements to work towards.

- The fishing itself is not very intuitive. I get that the developers were trying to achieve “realism”, but it’s important to remember that this is a game and games are supposed to be fun. The game won’t allow you to just pick a random spot and throw your bobble into the water because the fish spawn at very specific locations. This means that a lot of the water area doesn’t have fish spawns at all, thus you can’t pick a spot at random and catch a fish. You have to go around looking at the water and physically see the fish you want to catch before commencing the actual fishing. I don’t know about the devs but I’ve been fishing at a freshwater lake for almost 30 years and as long as you sit down, have a bait of some sort and just wait, you’ll always catch something sooner or later. And no, I don’t need to circle the lake for hours trying to make eye-contact with the fish before choosing a spot. I can see that many others had this same complaint of not catching any fish if they just wanted to fish intuitively.

- The missions at the Norway map disappointed me deeply and they are the reason why I’m writing this review. The developers got A LOT of backlash for focusing on exploration over fishing. I was expecting them to listen to their customers when making the Norway reserve. But to my astonishment, they doubled down on the exploration! The new map has missions that forego fishing completely and just send you running around, looking for “clues” and “caches”. The hints given are pretty bad and I just can’t imagine who thought this would be a good idea / fun for anyone. The results speak for themselves, no-one even cares enough to make guide on how to finish these missions.

All and all this is one of those “I wonder if they actually played their own game before releasing it”- products. It’s more exploration than fishing. And, sadly, it’s more tedious than fun.
I wouldn't be this harsh if the game was in early access and by all accounts, it should be in early access. But it's not so I waited a few months and then took it at face value."
call+of+the+wild+the+angler,Not Recommended,23.5,"Posted: August 31, 2022
Don't expect a finished polished product. Despite calling this a full release this is very much an early access project that needs a lot of work. There are many good features and visuals and many bad or outright missing features and visuals.

The world itself looks incredible but the Water, the most important aspect in a fishing game, looks awful and blurry and your bobbers are all but invisible on the surface unless very close to you. actually fighting the fish is good but then there is an awful immersion breaking black screen cut to you suddenly holding the fish when you catch it, no pulling the fish out of the water or netting it.

character customization is nice but the ""type 1"" (male) character model is derpy looking and has a bad case of man-boobs.

Fishing lures are extremely generic and simple, and many do not work as they are supposed to. baits for float fishing are ok but the selection of hard plastic lures is awful, and the soft plastics are incredibly bad, there aren't even different color options just different sizes for the same color of grub, shad, etc. Fishing lures in the real world are designed to catch the fisherman as much as the fish, with tens of thousands of designs, colors, and techniques to choose from, so for a real world Angler to come to this game and find a single design of crankbait, swimbait, frog, jerkbait, and spinnerbait, with only a single color option for each size of lure, is awfully disappointing. color choice of a lure is incredibly important when fishing, weather, water clarity, local baitfish, etc. all play a part and while i don't expect such things to be implemented in a game like this having the option to at least pretend the color choice matters would be nice for immersion.

The ability to toggle between retrieval types when reeling is good and something I wish more fishing games had. Casting is atrocious, both in the button mechanics and animations, there is nothing remotely approaching realistic casting physics, and no one has ever cast a lure like they do in this game in the history of mankind, at least not without throwing the lure straight into the ground and backlashing. Please let us walk while the line is cast and/or fish is on the hook.

All in all the game is a very frustrating mix of great and terrible mechanics and great and terrible visuals. it feels like the developers have definitely put some effort into the game but also like they have never played any of the decent fishing games on the market before, let alone gone fishing in real life beyond a guided trip or two where someone else did the hard work for them. Fishing planet, Ultimate fishing simulator, and fishing sim world all have lessons that could have been learned to use to improve this game. this game has the potential to outshine any of those in the future, but is not there yet.

I have wanted EW to make a fishing game since long before this was ever announced and I hate to be giving a negative review to a game I have been anticipating for so long but there is hope for the future. TheHunter COTW and classic are both miles better games now than they were when they released and this dev has a history of sticking with their games in the long term with consistent updates of both free and paid content. I pray that they continue to listen to their community and improve this game, and hope to be able to change this review relatively soon.

ETA: I want to be clear that there is still some fun to be had in this game, and i intend to play it for a while, and i believe it will eventually be a great game if the developers stick with it and do not abandon it. I just want people to be aware of what they are getting into at this early point in the game. Also my game has now crashed twice, both after or while interacting with the shop.

Norway Reserve Update: coming back to the game a bit with the addition of the new reserve, glad to see it being given for free. The game is definitely moving in the right direction, and the map design and landscape visuals continue to shine in the new reserve, though water still has issues particularly with odd shadows that traverse the water from the sides and vertically as you move your head, at least on Norway. I think this was a good choice of location for the new reserve and the higher level gear is appropriately more expensive to grind for, giving some more purpose to actually grinding money which is good. fish movement and behavior when fighting has definitely improved and feels more on par with other fishing games now, particularly with the harder fighting fish like the new salmon. fishing with lures/jigs still feels inconsistent to me compared to the float fishing which seems to have a much higher success rate in quickly getting a bite, i could just need to do more research into whether a specific retrieve is needed and proper hook size etc. though i am making sure to use baits listed as preferred by the fish im targeting. Limiting to 30 inventory slots still feels way too restrictive for no real reason imo and just means you practically have to go back to a store every time you want to target a different species.

The game still has a ways to go and many of my other complaints and positives from initial review remain true as well, but it is definitely headed in the right direction and I still believe it can be a great game if they continue to stick with it. my review would be in more of a grey area now but I still say buy it if you aren't too picky about your fishing games and just want something to chill with, and/or you are willing to wait for it to live up to it's potential."

Okay, I hate to waste time leaving reviews in general let alone negative ones but i feel compelled to do so here.

I wanted to like this game and I gave it a fair shot at over 30 hours played.. and...eh..

The visuals are fine, i see complaints about the water. It didn't bother me and thought it worked/looked fine. The species of fish were fine to me and amount. I liked the rods and reels..I enjoyed the cosmetics, etc.. all of what I like is aesthetic though, it finally hit me.

The game just doesn't know what it wants to be.

I DO NOT understand why we cannot keep our fish as trophies. This instantly turned a friend of mine off of the game. They literally asked ('but we can put our big catches in the lodge right'??). NOPE. sorry. you must release all fish and you cannot keep any as actual trophies. I mean we have lodges in hunter. just link the lodge through apex connect and let us keep fish trophies. sorry no. just toss it back and move on. PETA wouldn't approve.?

I DO NOT understand why we cannot simply invite a friend to play with us like their other hunting game. Oh no. here we MUST create an account and login, then join some server and join with a bunch of randos. Like this is some MMO type of game or something. this is horrible. All I wanted to do was jump into some fishing with a friend of mine. just us, very simple. but no. you need an account, you have to login, you have to join some rando server etc.. i mean why? why is this so convoluted when their other game is not.. no ty.

I DO NOT understand why we need to run around and collect sticks, bugs, bark and other stuff in this park.. I want to fish. period. nothing else. This isn't a hunting game where you are already in the woods roaming around and naturally come upon a point of interest. In this game you want to be on or next to the water fishing. NOT roaming the shire looking for random stuff Bilbo has laying around or diseased trees with full fishing gear on. This is ridiculous. This all needs to be removed. A simple solution? Just make some quests where we can get plastic out of the lakes, or maybe fish up old line and hooks, etc. you know stuff that you may do while actually fishing and not something that has you running around mines and mountains like you are in Moiria headed to Mordor..

I DO NOT understand why the handbook is so limited and lacking. Sorry I cant remember 70 dang types of lures and hook sizes and baits and what sizes exactly go with what etc.. The hand book gives you some basic idea of the fish and what they like. but it is severely lacking hook sizes. At least the handbook should add things to the fish 'description' when you try it and it works.. so ..you know, you can go back and look. because that's great if you are a pro fisher, I'm not and there is no way i'm going to remember all the baits and hook sizes that go with every type of fish and then add the 'ranks' on top of that. its just not happening. The book should add things or info as we go along or unlock new 'finds' so we can simply find that info later on. because I am def not remembering all this and I'm not making spreadsheets for this GAME.

Speaking of the hooks and whatnot. They make no sense to me. I've been fishing a bit, no where near a pro lol, but I'm not completely ignorant. I'm sorry this game needs some serious leeway.. You need to be exact literally exact to catch fish in my 30+ hour experience I've found. You need (just an example I'm making up) a size #4 hook to catch LM Bass. okay. If you use a #3. NOPE. sorry. bass don't even think its there. This is so game breaking and nauseating to have to be THAT exact with fishing. I've been fishing I have caught some bluegill with very large hooks, almost comical but they got hooked somehow, and the exact opposite has happened too with a larger fish swallowing a small hook or getting it stuck in gills. This game. you need to be 100% using the literal exact # hook size or the fish ignore the bait. At least make it so the fish attempt the 'bite'.. the game could adjust and give the fish a % chance to throw the hook or become free if it goes for a #3 over the 'needed' #4 for bass. its just off-putting how this is done and feels in game, having to be literally so exact on-the-nose.

The issue above also makes the game.. boring after my 30+ hours. I know if i cast this exact bait with this hook # then I am getting a gold like every time with a silver tossed in here and there. This just needs to be way more random, which goes along with what i stated above. Its just to literal and on-the-nose.

Can we get 3rd person boats and 'jeeps'?

Can we make 'jeeps' not feel like they are on ice.?

Can we please be allowed to change the time of day? I would like to be able to fish at night time with out having to wait an entire day cycle to do so and then feel rushed.. Makes it not-so-fun to find those catfish spots.

Can we fish bobber-less please, just drop bait down into the lake. like Cheese, weight, drop over board for those bottom feeders?

Can we fish up random stuff? like.. Line, Hooks, garbage maybe, the odd turtle here or there, etc. Also tie the quests to this type of stuff, not the shire/bilbo item collecting crap.

I could go on but I am going to stop here at this point.

This game IMO should of been made into the next map of Hunter CoTW along with the hunting. A full 'outdoor' experience. As a stand alone game this game is just kind of a mess and goes in different directions and tries things that just do not work out at all, and leaves some things out completely that we are use to from the hunting game..

As is stands now I am sorry but I did give this game a fair shot and i did want to like and really enjoy it. But i just cannot and do not recommend this game to others as it stands now. There are just to many 'issues' once the 'pretty back round' phase has passed.

sorry this is a no-buy IMO.."

Welp... this is quite embarrassingly poor and disappointing. As someone who has checked fishing every year on both editions of theHunter's yearly surveys, this just hurts. I've sunk some time into it, and the best way that I can describe it is that they played the telephone game with experienced anglers trying to communicate fishing to game designers, then to a bunch of programmers whose outside experience was limited to hiking to the bus stop, then actually made by interns on a serious crunch.

For the uninitiated, the game is a dual fishing/exploration experience, which is a fantastic concept, and that has absolutely massive potential, with exploration being rewarding too. It is made in one of the most beautiful open world engines out there, after all.

Here are my biggest gripes about the core of the game:
- Buggy. Very, very buggy. Feels like a late alpha build.
- Graphics. Performance for me is good on Ultra, but I have a beefy computer that can handle it. The details are what makes this a problem. Aggressive distance object culling results in eye-sore landscapes, as anything beyond a certain point is barren except from a few 2D bushes and trees. Top that off with FXAA or no AA making those 2D objects really pixelly and unbearable to look at, so TAA is you're only option. Also, V-Sync causes horrible stuttering (almost like an fps drop), and is particularly bad in cutscenes, where it appears like 13 fps while the camera is flying around. Kinda makes you sick.
- The water primarily is the issue here, and is kind of a massive portion of the game. Clearly Apex wasn't designed to handle dynamic water, and I'm guessing making it was taking up too much of EW's time, so a functioning prototype was just put in. There are no waves, just simple movement in some wind direction, or a flowing texture in rivers, without any actual flow. On top of it all, it's surface is just weird, it's like it got blurred out of existence. Bobbers/floats are extraordinarily tiny, and are nearly invisible due to that blurring effect. It's probably worst on Lake Delirium, near the hot springs, where it's basically blue pool water, and it looks like someone spilled blue void paint and fish are swimming in air sometimes.
- Steering for both boat and vehicle M&K is progressive (haven't tried on controller yet), which results in excessive swerving, since a tap is too little, and a short press is too much. It's a much bigger problem on vehicles, though. Something a little more definite would be nice.
- Dialogue can be quite cringy and annoying. Particularly Sophia being a jabber-jack. Having a reduced dialogue option would be nice, since simply turning it off ruins portions of the world.
- Lighting could use some work, particularly around dawn/dusk. As someone who lives in the mountains, it's not quite like someone just turned the lights off when the sun goes behind the mountains.
- Having the ability to change time of day would also be nice. Want to target species that prefer nighttime? Well, pull up your favorite meme page and wait.
- Are you American and don't want to use the Metric system? Well too bad! Even though you've changed your preference to Imperial, most of the measurements are still in Metric, and what is in Imperial has the wrong units. Nobody measures their fish in yards, rarely feet, and almost always in inches. In fact, I'm pretty sure most Metric anglers don't use meters to measure their fish. Units could use to be revised.
- Character customization is awfully lackluster and uncreative. Makes buying apparel pretty much non-existent.
- Missions are often cryptic and sometimes they seem like they just forgot to add in the important stuff. How to Catch a Whitefish - Step 1, get the recommended gear. Okay, what is the recommended gear? It doesn't tell you anywhere, and doesn't allow you to accept anything else until you've completed that.

Exploration:
It's not bad, surprisingly. The only aspect of the game that isn't entirely broken.

Now the fishing aspect of the game... oh boy.
- You have some Ultra-Polarized X-Ray Vision Sunglasses equipped, and you can magically see any and all fish in the water. Makes the fishing dumb and predictable. Oh, there's a fish, I'll just cast to it, and clearly it's working, and I can just watch it take my bait. There is sight fishing in real life, but it's usually in really shallow and/or clear water - the trick is that they can see you too, which these fish don't seem to care too much about.
- Casting is awful. No matter what, you will always cast the same distance, or 2/3 of that with the short cast. No rod, reel, or line combo is going to change that. You shouldn't be able to jig when you cast your line like you do. There's also not an option to let line out, either, so you can jig if you wanted to.
- Once you catch a fish, physics leaves the chat. Reeling in a tired fish bends your rod nearly in half, and puts your line tension up excessively high, meanwhile a fish pulling drag only puts the force meter to your drag setting, and your rod barely reflects that that fish is pulling. The whole point of a drag system is to limit the maximum force exerted on the line, yet simply pumping the rod will nearly max out the tension, entirely bypassing the drag system.
- Speaking of tired fish, well, they don't sometimes. I've seen and caught numerous fish landed with drastically underpowered equipment. I've landed a pissed off 15lbs carp that I foul-hooked in the dorsal on an ultralight rod with 6lb-test line that I was using to catch stocked trout, simply because I managed tension and eventually tired the fish out. In game, I fought with a fish for over 7 minutes, and it just refused to get tired, and you end up in a stalemate with the fish, and you've got to break or cut the line.
- The game description says it realistically places fish based on time, habitat, and temperature, yet you find fish in the most questionable locations. For instance, largemouth bass near the surface in the middle of a lake at 30 meters depth at midday with no cover at 50°F... yeah, that doesn't happen. I can say that with certainty and experience, as I grew up in Wyoming (where Golden Peaks Reserve is supposed to be located) fishing for these exact fish species.
- Some lures attract fish they shouldn't, and some don't attract any. Soft plastics are a joke, and I haven't been able to catch a single fish with any soft-plastics. Trout rarely go after top-water hardbaits like poppers and frogs, but they do in game, sometimes absolutely nothing will be attracted to a spinner (even though that's a universal lure, really). Then baits are sometimes really weird. Nothing wants to bite on a worm? Really? Everything will eat a worm, especially panfish like bluegill, and I'm surprised that they just don't have any effectiveness. Also the preferred baits listed in the handbook often times have absolutely no effect on the intended species.
- Fish are slow and dumb. Since you can see all the fish, you can tell when they're interested in your lure - but they just can't catch up to it, but aren't attracted to a slower retrieve that they can catch up with. Really frustrating sometimes.
- The UI is weird an unintuitive. When bobber fishing, the UI in the corner barely reflects the state of the bobber, and you can usually just look at memes and wait for the audio cue, rather than actually watch your bobber (if you could) or the UI. When spin fishing, you've got a random powering up bar that looks like it belongs on some random piece of tech in a random 80's sci-fi film that really has no effect on gameplay other than being annoying. Also, you've got two more numbers that at least on indicated depth of the lure, and the other, no idea - I presume it tells you in the spin fishing tutorial, but it's bugged.

There's still more, but my fingers hurt and I hit the character limit, so that's all I've got."

If you are looking for a complete fishing simulation game look elsewhere.

The game was released in an Alpha state but treated as a full release. While the game has come a fair ways from the release state it is still an early release at beast in playability. I personally am still experiencing the day one issue of not having fishing spots trigger and mark on my map. The graphics are a far cry from their older game running on their previous engine. The fact that they have worked to improve the water graphics and physics shows that none of these were done pre-release but could have been if a larger team, more time, or an honest appraisal and statement by the developer of the current state of the game from the start.

All in all 4/10 with the possibility to improve once they put a full development team on the title

UPDATE 11/10/22

The challenger update did nothing to resolve the issues that have been raised. The community team will also harass you in their discord for having any opinion that is contrary to theirs and will ban you if you dont back down or allow them to continue to harass you with other members of their community."

EDIT: I do appreciate the fact that the devs read the reviews and are implementing changes with the feedback. Most devs wouldnt do this. Hopefully this whole list will be crossed off soon.

Fixed issues so far:
- Trying to get into a lobby with a friend is a nightmare
- reeling speed doesn't match the amount of line reeling in.
- fish swim too slow, and sometimes cant catch up to your bait depending on how fast you reel in.
- the water close to you looks good, but distant water looks bad and blurry. (water is looking and acting better)



Another example of why everyone hates the current gaming industry. Releasing a full game for 30$ and having only 12 fish species. should be named trout simulator since 95% of every water body has trout unrealistically. should have bluegill, crappie, and other sunfish in every water body, otherwise there would be no predator fish.

Cons:
- low amount of tackle
- not having the ability to bottom fish or other ways to fish, like carp or catfish with rod holders
- cant move while casted
- fish are mostly all visible on the surface making it too easy to catch fish
- casting animation doesn't make sense, the bail is closed when casting, also there's no ability to cast where you want, it's either really close to you or super far away.
- topwater lures like a frog and popper sink, which makes no sense at all.
- no leaderboards
- challenge quests give you a free diamond for each fish species taking the fun away of catching one on your own. It just spawns gold/diamond fish just for your challenge, and once you caught the diamond, all the fish go away.
- only having 30 inventory slots is too low
- no chat system to talk with other players
- putting together tackle combinations are limited. For example, you can't put a float setup on a baitcaster, can't put live bait on jigheads
- no in game clock to see what time it is, or having no way to change your time




Pros:
- map looks really nice
- fun to explore remote bodies of water even tho its all just trout usually
- is still fun to play with friends despite all the problems"

EDITED FOR EVOLUTION UPDATE:
My prior review still stands true for the game along with the following addition:

The good fishing gear is now locked behind the reputation system. You are required to do NON FISHING MISSIONS to get fishing gear. So running around for hours on end taking photos of flowers... makes no sense.

You are now paid per fish caught.

They added 8 new species to the starter map. Including Sturgeon. Sturgeon are strictly bottom feeding fish... but they still have no way to fish the bottom. So you have to fish for them on float in the top 1.4 meter of water. Makes tons of sense?

The Short review:
The maps are beautiful. It's a great treasure hunting game. But everything else needs a lot of work.

After 5 days of playing review:

Again, the maps are stunning in standard fashion for the Dev. But after 5 days the actual mechanics have been the biggest let down with The Angler.

I do appreciate the fact that you can throw a float, lure, or jig on a spinning rod. This is a realistic thing to do. Spinning rods are versatile like that. So that is a positive for the game.
The treasure hunt missions are a nice break from the fishing...

Now for the bad, the fishing:
The income thing is not explained and is based off of xp gained and not per fish (not explained anywhere.)
Line is chosen by the rod's max rated capability, I don't know what to say on that. Just strange.
For casting, you can cast short or long. There is no real in between. Can't ""clip"" to a specific distance.
Gear is exceptionally limited. There are no leaders, a 10lb pike would shred through the lines they have. Steel leaders would make sense here, don't exist in the game.
Catfish are bottom dwellers, but you catch them on the surface... again, don't know what to say on that.
Physics for Jig fishing: broken at best? Jigs drop fairly fast when not reeling, but when reeling at the slowest speed and obvious slack is in the line they stay at the same depth.
They give you bass boats, but no sonar/depth sounder or a trolling motor.
The SUV's... nauseating to drive. There is something about the camera in the SUV's that turn them into a vomit comet.
No bottom/feeder fishing. Don't know why, got the fish and bait in game that this would make sense for it, no form of bottom fishing implemented.
Can only fish 1 rod. Only fishing game I've seen that you cannot fish more than 1 rod at a time.
Visual bugs/short comings like hands clipping through the reels, or fishing from a boat and seeing your shadow and it just doesn't match what your character is doing. It's like playing a horror game at times with the shadow thing and the strange almost moaning sound on the starter map.
The multiplayer: you can shut it off, but it's not explained how to. No blacklist option for the rude lot that will park their boat on top of you or come and throw their line right on your's. I realize rude players are a thing, just give us tools to combat the problem ""children.""

It's a lot like seeing a really good kit car. It looks sharp, it looks like it's fast... but then you realize the body is sitting on a rusted out 1972 VW chassis and the engine has 1 dead cylinder, 2 fouled plugs and a bad rear main seal. Also 2nd gear is stripped out and the clutch is slipping like mad.

I just can't suggest this game to anyone when there are free options out there with way better mechanics. Even for half the price you get better mechanics on another. I bought this game on a deep discount so I don't feel too ripped off. I just feel that this doesn't live up to other games in the Dev's library for quality (Hunter CotW.) Maybe eventually they will fix it all, or maybe they'll just keep pumping out DLC for it and say it's fine as is. Don't know."

UPDATED REVIEW - OLD REVIEW IS BELOW

Patch 1.2.1 has been released. It's been over 30 days since we got a patch, and all they've focused on is increasing diamond rarity spawn rates. 30 days for spawn rates! Also, a developer has commented on my review, asking to join Discord. I've been on the discord for a few months now, and everyone is making lots of suggestions to improve the game, but the devs are responding very slowly, if at all, despite the large number of requests! The discord is also becoming less and less active, mainly because there is no proper communication between the developers and the players. Unfortunately, as evidenced by this patch, the devs have ignored what the players have requested, no one knows why because there is no communication, but this is also why players are leaving the game on a daily basis.We get a maximum of 200 players per day, and this continues to drop; it used to be 500+ players.

This game really has a future if they start listening to the players quickly and push the patches faster; otherwise, I fear the worst for this game.
So much potential! I hope the developers finally focus on what the community is asking for. In the future, I will update my review as needed as patches happen that steer the game in a better direction.

Meanwhile, I and the community mostly keep asking for:
- Set the time yourself because some people can't play in the dark and because some fish become more active at certain times.
- Make the game more about fishing and release updates accordingly; the game is now mainly focused on exploring the map and not fishing.
- We can't talk freely because of the chat system.
- Fish spawns and quests feel programmed without realism.
- There are still 30 inventory slots available! This is really little, and nobody understands why they can't increase it! There is a lot of annoyance here because you have to travel a long distance back to the store to change things.
- Carp fishing is missing.
- Trolls missing.
- Feeder fishing is missing.
- You can't move when your rod is in the water.
- You have no rod support, so you can't fish with multiple rods.
- Fish spawn and behavior feel extremely scripted and unnatural.
- Your score is based only on the line thickness you use; the reel and rod don't matter
- More camera options, such as third-person and underwater cameras, are required.
- When compared to the default map, the DLC map performs horribly.
- There are no weather effects.
- Achievements are all based on everything except fishing!! I've been trying to get 100% for a long time now.

ORIGINAL REVIEW


COTW Angler has some of the most beautiful scenery I've seen in any fishing game. There is lots of beautiful terrain with rivers and lakes. But that's the only big plus the game has at the moment: it looks good.
The game itself is less; the developers have focused way too much on exploring the map instead of fishing, which is what the game should be all about. Your first main quest involves driving around the entire map, visiting outposts and unlocking new towns. And this on narrow roads where your car can become stuck quickly. To give you an idea, this is a community made map of all locations, objects, and POI:

If you have a quest to catch a diamond fish, for example, the game will continue to spawn fish until you have caught the required fish. If you don't have an active quest, all the fish disappear, and you regularly catch nothing.
This is also a stupid system; big fish can only be caught with specific hooks; otherwise, the diamond fish will not bite. In real life, you never know what you're going to catch, even if you use smaller hooks.

For 30 EUR, I absolutely cannot recommend this game. What I personally would like to change:

- Change the time so you don't get stuck in the middle of the night for hours.
- Focus less on map exploration and more on fishing.
- The chat, allow us to speak freely with no fixed messages.
- Make fish spawns more balanced throughout the game, not just when you have a quest.
- The ability to muffle the director and the woman at the desk.
- Expand your inventory space; you only have 30 slots for hooks, lures, fishing rods, and so on."

Product refunded

I read the negative reviews, but I wanted to give it a try anyway.
It was disappointing. There are Early Access games that are more developed than this.

If the game had been released as an Early Access game, at least it would have prepared you better for it. Releasing this as a full game, you come in with certain expectations. The game is definitely NOT a finished product. It already starts with the character customization. Seriously?! Blonde or go bald?!

The driving feels sloppy. Then again, it's not a driving game. The water is, like many reviews already mentioned, oily. This is a fishing game, so you look at it a lot.

I read people go: It just came out, it will get better.
Is this really how low our expectations need to be for a full release of a game nowadays?
Or are we allowed to expect more?"

I like this game a lot BUT I wouldn't recommend it ( at least for now )

Reasons are :-

1- The game is totally not finished at all
2- Lots of bugs and glitches
3- Sometimes you wonder if you still playing a fishing game or not
4- Using the map is a pain in the butt ... so laggy and difficult to choose as specific location ( controller )
5- Adding a friend is VERY confusing and VERY laggy too
6- After some long fish fights , your drag will lock at 100% for no specific reason and the line will snap even if you dong drag at all
7- Using the quick menu to choose the bait will not allow you to reach some baits to select them ( controller )
8- For a map this big , they could have added more fish, rods, & baits
9- One of the lakes is glitched as if you try to float fish in it , your bait will keep sinking no matter what you do

Faced other glitches too but will stick with this for now"

If I wanted to sit on a lake all day and catch nothing I'd go real fishing. On the plus side, I get in WAY less trouble for drinking a 12 pack on the boat here than I do in real life.

Add some fish."

Huge disappointment overall. Doesn't hold up to The Hunter, not even in the slightest. I'm not sure why the level of quality wouldn't start with that of The Hunter, but apparently it's ok to charge full-price for an incomplete game w/ 10 year old quality. Hopefully it'll get better with time, but I don't see why an extra $50+ in DLC's over the next year+ (if we're lucky) justify so many people's forgiving reviews. The Devs need to know how bad it is, not miss all the criticisms because someone still gave it a thumbs up, even though it's an incomplete game with a huge list of embarrassing and detrimental flaws. You don't even make it past the character customization before it's obvious that the game was incomplete. The character development is literally worse than many 90's games. Here's a list of key elements that the game should've had in order to justify being launched as ""complete"" and not in Alpha. Not worth $30, more like a $10 game atm. Hopefully these things will come soon enough. I'll update and refine the list as things come up.

- The worst Character Creation I've ever seen. Really needs more options for EVERYTHING! Offensively limited.
- Water quality is terrible *UPDATED/IMPROVED

- Non-realistic lure and bobber action *UPDATED/IMPROVED*

- Reeling speed is broken and inaccurate *UPDATED* Now seems to be overly compensated and too slow (hand visual) when reeling at speeds of 1-2

- Distance of cast and line out is broken and inaccurate

- Fish look and act cartoonish and completely unrealistic

- Immersion is broken due to a cut screen when bringing fish on-shore

- CANNOT PASS TIME!? This is absolutely essential IMO.

- No variance of fish species based in any conditions (time, area, weather, etc.) *UPDATED/NEEDS IMPROVEMENT*

- No time of day, or weather variance *UPDATED/SEEMS WORSE*

- Can't enter buildings

- Can't set up a tent/camp

- Can't move after cast

- When you track a marker on your map, there is no indication of it on the map itself. No changed color or indicator

- CAN'T SAVE HARVESTS!? WTF!? Wen Fish Shack with mounted trophies!? At least a record of harvests, please!

- Extremely glitchy graphics overall. *UPDATED/SLIGHTLY IMPROVED*

- Multiplayer doesn't work *UPDATED/FIXED*

THE LIST GOES ON! I'll update the above list more as I go. FEEL FREE TO SHARE ADDITIONAL GLITCHES/BUGS/INADEQUACIES BELOW IN THE COMMENTS BELOW!
If confirmed, I will add them to the core list above.

UPDATES:

Hotfix 1.01 is in today (9/5/22). Fixed a few minor issues (look up the patch notes for more details) but didn't address anything major which is to be expected so early. Slowly but surely, this game will get better and better.

Hotfix 1.02 helped the water quality A LOT! Looks much better but still far from perfect. It's great to know that the devs are working hard and getting fixes in.
As well as water quality slightly improving, the reeling speed is actually relative to the speed set, which is a no brainer improvement that helps immersion and game interaction.

- This Hotfix seems to have cause a daylight glitch that I've yet to pinpoint the finer details of as the update just came out and I haven't put many hours in since. But the light seems to act sporadically at random points of transitionary light (day to night/night to day)."

Newest new Edit:
I don’t really even need to play it again to know there’s still not a reason to buy this. Just reading about the update has made me certain this game is meant to fail.

The community has almost unanimously agreed that the ‘questing’ or ‘lore’ objectives are atrocious and lead to the player spending more time driving around and looking at rocks than actually fishing.

So what have they done?

They’ve made questing an essential part of the game to progress your gear and equipment.

They just want your money, they don’t care about making a fun game.


I've felt it was time to try this again with the first DLC coming out. (and the multiple dev reply's I've recieved) Needless to say they've made many performance improvements and bug fixes since I last played. The game hardly ran at 60fps and now seems to run smooth as can be for me but I know that may not be the case for everyone. This I'm very happy to see.


-Performance
-Fish Speed/AI (It has been tweaked, still not perfect but much better than Day 1)
-Multiplayer adjustments/fixes
-Water look (they water doesn't look perfect yet either but the physics still suck in a lot of instances)
-Reel speed adjustments
-Fishing animations fixes
-Day and night cycle SEEM to be fixed... (no in game clock)

And that's where the good ends.

-Lack of fish variety (Don't be fooled by the DLC. They did not add 13 all new fish. Most are rehashed form the base game with some variations or all new ones sprinkled in)
-Can't net fish
-No fishing equipment (tripods, cages, etc.)
-Can't move while casted
-No action camera (This isn't quite a fishing sim so why not a close up camera for the hook/fish?)
- Nothing to do that are fishing related
-Still fetch quests and lore pages


-Bugs everywhere. Multiplayer bugs, fishing bugs, lure bugs, fish spawn out of thin air to bite your lure (sadly, I wouldn't be surprised if this was intentional)
-Useless multiplayer. There is nothing to compare between others, no place to gather, no challanges to compete in. It's pointless and should be turned off.

If this game wasn't 65% driving around in a busted jeep, it'd be OK at best. There is still so much to work on and add that the fact they've already got DLC #2 lined up is quiet frightening. The goal clearly isn't to make a functional multiplayer driven fishing game. It's to crank out DLC after DLC like CotW does and soak in the profits.

Add fishing tournaments or a fishing HUB. There feels no need to have multiplayer on as you can't anything together other than experience countless bugs like floating lures and missing catch animations.

DLC (currently free to own as of writing this) this game is worth at most 15$. This isn't a good fishing game quite yet. They'd need to remove the fetch items, dumb lore dumps and forced map exploration then add the other half of the fishing game for this game to really be worth the money.


Edit
10 hours in and I'm still not convinced. The game loop is BAD. The three most important things in a fishing game are just so far off from being ready that it's really sad that the game came out like this. The fishing animations (casting, reeling, inability to move, no netting), the water quality/physics and the fish animations/AI are all atrocious. The only things this game has going for it is the map. Until you start exploring and realize how empty and useless it is. The open map style from Hunter:COTW just doesn't translate well into a fishing game. It's hard to say how much time will be needed to flip this game around but, sadly, my review still stands. If you're hesitant, stay away from this until the core mechanics are fixed.

Edited Original review. Toned it down a bit and made some more concise critiques:
2 Hour Review:
Picture this. You're an avid fisherman looking for a fresh experience. You've spent half of your pension and abandoned your wife to travel thousands of miles to fish at the Golden Ridge Reservation with none other than Wal-marts hardiest Wonder Woman hunting & fishing rod with included Batman themed bobber.

You're greeted by a woman on a walkie-talkie who does their best to man-splain how to cast your mint condition rod and reel. Fine. You cast Batman a few times to appease this radio-wench. But casting is not enough. She forces you to Assassin's Creed climb the nearest fire watch station. She explains that although fishing supplies are abundant, maps are only given to the elite 0.1% of gamers. You must explore the map by foot or by Jurassic Park jeep to discover anything meaningful.

But at last. You've made it to the first small outpost in the center of the reservation. You can finally start what you came here to do. Your batman bobber weeps tears of joy. You cast Wonder Woman as far as you can into the Lake. You wait. And wait. And wait. Nothing bites. You move spots and cast again. You wait longer than before.

2 hours have gone by and you've spent the majority of your vacation in a jeep listening to the local game warden complain about all of the ecologically devastating corporations that operate freely throughout the worlds emptiest reservation. You pick up notes, trinkets and report sparkling plant life along the way, only attempting to fish only once or twice along the way.

It's finally hit you that your newly broken marriage and 30 years worth of your pension may not have been worth doing fetch quests for the worlds worst park ranger and extortionist bait shop owner.

You load a 12 gauge shell into your Wal-mart Wonder Woman hunting & fishing rod and pray there are more than 12 species of fish in Heaven.


Serious Review:
This is by far the worst fishing game ever made. PS2 fishing games function better than this. This is 80% exploration, 10% reloading the game, 5% Googling questions, 4% searching for the Steam refund policy and 1% actually fishing. I am greatly disappointed to see so many people give the pass to this game. It may have the POTENTIAL to be good but by golly is it so far away from it. There's practically nothing good going for it in it's current state.

The BAD:
And the actual fishing part of the game could not be any more shallow.
No moving after casting
Only 2 reeling speed animations. You could be at 1x speed but your hand looks like it's reeling in 500yrds a minute.
Mulitplayer just doesn't work the majority of the time
The water quality is HORRENDOUS
Fishing rod animations are broken/unrealistic
Fish animations and AI are very unrealistic. Some fish must be broken because I have google how to catch a few diffrenet kinds and have gotten 0 after IRL hours of trying. I check what location, bait/lures to use and time of day and get the same 4-5 fish every time.
No real sense of progression besides a Lvl number and currency. You can have maxed out gear in less than 3 hours without trying that hard.
Can't pass time for some ungodly reason. I've also noticed that the time of day doesn't cycle correctly the majority of my play time.
No special equipment (tents, tripods etc)
Animations instead of netting fish
Only 12 species of fish on a map more than large enough to house more fish.
The map UI simply doesn't work. It is extremely non-user friendly. Mini map is needed badly.
The majority of the 'quests' expect you to explore rather than fish. Some quest are outright broken/buggy to complete.
These are just things I've noticed in the first 10 HOURS of playing.

The unfortunate truth however is that this will likely go the route of HCOTW and all meaningful content will be behind a pay wall. Only pick this up at $5 or less. I will not shill for another dev/game but there are PLENTY of better and fully functioning fishing sims out there. This one adds nothing new while being incredibly regressive in the fishing sim genre."

The game is highly not recommended. The multiplayer session is whack. There is no settings so anybody random can join your session. I'm not a fan of this because you don't have any control of who is entering your session. This can ruin your session that you've started.

I'll also say that this game should've been a DLC for CotW: The Hunter. They could've easily just added fishing to that game and just removed the 'The Hunter'. Not to mention the driving is terrible. The Hunter is worth the money, but The Angler isn't."

This game needs an AWFUL amount of work to be a good fishing game, but the potential is HUGE. If they can patch it in time it could very well be one of the best fishing games to ever exist. But there are some glaring problems and the game feels very early access even though it isn't somehow..

I've just realised I never put down the positives of this game, so lemme do that before I list the issues.

Here are some of the good aspects of the game.

-Graphics are very pretty.
-Sound effects are quite nice.
-Catching fish is fairly satisfying.
-Driving around on a car/boat is relaxing.
-Doing the challenges are pretty fun and gives a direction for the player to head towards while teaching the player about spots where they could fish.
-You can see the fish swimming around under the water and you can actually catch them.
-Collectibles are quite fun to obtain.
-There are a lot of nice fishing spots that feel calm and interesting to fish at.
-You're able to change your character design completely whenever you want.
-NPCs that talk make the game feel more lively, and while there isn't many of them the ones that talk do make the world feel more alive. (Even if sometimes a particular shopkeeper talks too much)
-Souvenirs a good step in the right direction, but souvenirs also don't work as a good progression style because you're not actually improving but looking more special, but since it's there as an end-game thing when you'd already have all the good equipment, I'll leave it as a positive thing)

Here are some of the issues I've noticed that need to be added/removed/adjusted/fixed..
(as these get fixed, I'll put down next to the issue whether it's been fixed/improved/revised etc. from what I've seen)

-Mirrors on vehicles don't work, immersion breaking.
-(Improved) There's a slight delay between hooking and starting to pull in the fish, doesn't feel smooth.
-Tension on bottom right needs to split between rod, reel and line (similar to setting tension settings to pro in fishing planet, you can see which of your parts are weak and holding you back)
-Tension meter needs to be smoother, the UI is very jumpy looking.
-Drag percentage needs to be closer to the tension meter so you don't have to look across your screen to see drag.
-(Improved) Water textures need work, shimmering/blurry textures break immersion and immersion is extremely important in a simulator
-Bait count UI, why do I need to open my inventory to see how many baits I have left.. Also, show rod name, which rod setup it is etc.
-Repairing equipment for money. Maintenance costs makes a simulation a simulation.
-Better camera movement options, ability to reduce sway when rod is casted and moving camera for better motion. Make it so the rod moves static with the camera. What is this weird slow camera following? I've noticed there's an issue as well if you pull up the rod with the right mouse button and let go while moving the rod in a direction, it'll do some weird catch-up. Why not just keep camera straight, and adjust it evenly with the rod movement.. (Fishing Planet ffs, there's a reason they're still going strong)
-Time forwarding to change time of day.
-Ability to zoom towards bobber/bail when float fishing
-Ability to see how deep lure is when lure fishing
-Stop vehicles from de-spawning if you close the game. Nothing like being stranded in the middle of nowhere, sure you can fast travel but if you've driven quite far you're stuck walking around unless you want to go all the way back.
-Make UI animations smoother, holding E on objects and watching the bar fill up at 3 fps looks very janky.
-Performance is... eh for the graphics. Everything maxed out, it doesn't look super amazing but frames aren't great. (average 90 on RTX 3080 @ 1080p)
-Make Cars/Boats cost money to add more progression elements. I want to earn the right to drive a boat/car, but I guess for a game like this it might be a necessity so this one could probably be skipped all together.
-Make Sophia Taylor talk less, I can't think and it's super distracting when she has to open her mouth every 5 seconds while I'm trying to figure out my setup, buying or selling etc.
-Make shop UI a lot better. It's terribly janky and half the time I accidentally close the menu, then I have to step back and step forward again for the option to appear to open the shop UI again.
-Make it so you lose hook/bait/line if you break the line, this incentivizes people not to screw up or to lose their lines to which you could also integrate leaders into the game.
-Allow free movement when standing on the boat. Being locked to four separate positions is not fun and feels very limiting in a game about being in the open.
-Make fish easier to see. I can't tell if it's the bad textures, or lighting but it's almost impossible to see where the fish is going or where the line is most of the time.
-Allow custom map markers with tags that we can rename. Right now, if you find a spot you like, you need to write it down elsewhere which once again, breaks immersion.
-Minimap, floating map or radar would be very convenient and quality of life. Would also help to not make me open my map every 15 seconds.
-Boats need to be faster, they're way too slow for the amount of water travelling you can do.
-Third person option would be nice but not necessary.
-Exploring the wilderness is fun, but it feels lifeless. At least add some passive small/large animals that might run around in the distance, more effects like rain/thunderstorm.
-(Slightly Improved, Game tells you when people catch fish and when you join a multiplayer session) Urgently needs some form of text chat/voice chat and friends list so players can communicate and fish together. Also adds life to the world which supports one of my other points.
-Add more role-playing elements, progression elements all that stuff. Make it feel like I'm progressing and becoming a better fisherman, I wanna see more bars go up, I want the xp gain to be more satisfying, all that good stuff. I want my dopamine receptors to fly off the second I catch a fish.
-More tackle/equipment options.

Problems aside, it's pretty fun. There aren't a lot of decent options when it comes to fishing simulators and as long as they do good and keep the development going it could be absolutely awesome.

When that time comes, I'll give it a positive review.

At this point in time, the $42.95 AUD price tag is absolutely not worth the money for the game you get. I'd say maybe, $20-$25 is a lot better. When a lot of the features get added and the game gets patched then I could see the price tag more reasonably.

There are a lot of nice collectibles and points of interest which give you rewards (cash/xp) for doing so which is pretty nice. (same as theHunter: Call of the Wild)

It would most likely be a successful game if a lot of the issues were fixed. We are pretty much starving for a decent fishing simulator and honestly, the best one, Fishing Planet gets boring after a little while.

There are a decent amount of rods, reels, baits, lines etc. but there definitely needs to be more.

I think they need to take a lot of good ideas from Fishing Planet and implement them all here. (Minus the P2W micro-transactions of course, this is a $42.95 AUD game but lets be honest we'll probably get at least some form of micro-transaction sooner than expected..)

Once the problems are fixed and the game is a lot more acceptable I'll change it to a positive review. For now, I unfortunately gotta recommend against it.

If you got money to burn and you reeeeeaallyy wanna play a decent potentially great upcoming fishing simulator, then this is definitely worth it.

Just, for the love of everything, don't add DLCs till you at least make it an acceptable fishing game..

TL;DR - Absolutely massive potential, has lots of issues that need to be patched/fixed, UI needs to be updated and features/QoL need to be implemented. Performance isn't great either even on a powerful GPU. $42.95 AUD P"

12hrs in, and I really can't recommend this game in its current state, it's not about the water, it's not about minor bugs, it's not about it being an arcade game, it's about the game being released with fundamental flaws in it's prime objective of being about fishing.

Fine, it's not a sim, it's miles from fishing planet and light years from rf4 but there are some real basics that are missing that simply should'n't have allowed the game to be a full release. Even the most basic arcade fishing games allow you to cast the distance you chose, not a preset of long or short. Being locked in your position when you hook a big fish or wish to slightly reposition whilst the bait is out, it's a basic of fishing games.

The day/night cycle is ridiculous, I have no problem with having rolling time but shorten the 24hr cycle to something that doesn't leave players stumbling around in the dark for ages, literally as there's no real flashlight in the game despite the supposed patch. Surely some dev spotted this as a serious issue?

OK so the multiplayer issue is more of a bug that will be resolved but as the social aspect was the main thrust of the game, you'd think they may have just got this sorted before full release.

Yes there are good points in the game, plenty in fact but the bottom line is that it was released well before it should've been, and a company shouldn't be rewarded by a thumbs up for selling a half finished product."

I waited to buy this game because it was obviously released before it was ready. Several improvements have been made for sure, but I still would not recommend anyone purchase it. My biggest gripes are the graphics and performance, as I feel EW's other COTW game (theHunter) is much cleaner looking with way more frames. The water up close is really great along with the underwater detail, but at distance the quality begins to suffer.

The fishing mechanics have improved what I've read and seen, but it could certainly be better. The tutorial had me catching largemouth bass with bread baits, which just isn't something that makes sense to someone who has fished for them my entire life and know them to be a predatory fish by nature. Also, every fish I've caught kind of awkwardly pauses at biting with a float, and with a lure they typically overshoot and have to double back to take the lure, which just looks strange.

Finally, I've been progressing through the warden/tour mission a bit and his incessant whining at every checkpoint has really soured me on the game. I get that America has a tarnished past, but most countries do as well to some extent. The repeated negativity is both hypocritical and tiresome, and oddly found its way into a fishing game. I've almost finished that mission, and would have considered refunding the game based on the story alone had it not taken me 2 hours to get this far. To this day, the MS map in TH:COTW is the only map I've not purchased, and it's simply because the studio chose to ignorantly trash southerners instead of coming up with a solid, non-biased story as with every other reserve. In theAngler, it looks like the devs could only focus on relentless negativity instead of even a passable plot."

Don't buy this at full price, it's definitely not worth 30 bucks.

The game is not great, it's very basic and very repetitive.

However: The levels are designed with love and care, and the fishing is fun.

I wish they integrated this with The Hunter COTW. It would be the hunting / fishing game we deserve.

Fishing here feels a bit bare-bones and the world is completely DEAD. (There are no animals in it).
SUPER weird decision when all they had to do, is to move a few assets from COTW over to this game.

It's okay, just barely. I bought it at a steep discount, so for me, it's acceptable. For full price, I would definitely feel cheated."

This might be the worst fishing game I ever played.

Good:
It is definitely a game...

Ok:
The environment is okay, looks nearly like unmodded skyrim...
Keybinding options exist and the performance is ok.

Bad:
Everything else. The Characters look terrible, you have 1 hair option and no color options, is this really the best you could do? The water looks like oil. The fish look weird, alien, in the oil that calls itself water. The gear looks weird, especially the bait. No third person at all, even for vehicles. Few fish species in a giant empty map of boredom. There are a few birds on the map, a few plants, thats it...

Terrible:
The fishing. Fade to black when landing a fish? What? No walking while fishing? I don't think the devs even tried their own game.

Overall I would recommend playing any other fishing game. Hell, even Genshin Impact fishing is better than this."

This game has some great potential but as a warning to those who have played other Fishing games , don't treat this game like them , treat it more as Hunter Call of the wild and then you would enjoy it more.

Now for the negatives.

Lure Fishing is terrible and i mean terrible, every lure no matter what type you use all act the same way in the water ( as if they are dangled on a piece of string ) there is no fluid or realistic lure movement with any lure.

Trying to get a lure technique going is so hard and unrealistic. all i can get is constant reel in and stop and go , i have seen twitch a few times but i think that was by accident when jigging the rod around.

a lot of work needs to be done to get this game worth playing and longevity , at the moment its ok for a few hours and thats just running around exploring.

Its called "" The Angler "" so fishing should be #1 priority and should be focused on getting right, everything else should be 2nd thought and worked on after.

Casting out when spin fishing is annoying when your angler lifts up the rod about 5ft in the air for no reason at all at the end of the cast, I lure fish irl and i never do that.
When reeling in at the end why does he flick the rod up as if its a mini strike, if you did this irl you would take your eye out.

Would i recommend this game to anyone ..... well this depends ......

If you want to just chill and mess around and laugh at how bad the fishing is then yes i would recommend the game to you.

If you want a middle of the road fishing game then i would wait and see what the updates bring before buying it.

tbh i have enjoyed the game so far but thats just me .. i'm easy to please and for £23 its no big deal if i only play it for 10 hours then shelf it for a while.

If the devs get this right and listen to the players at what needs fixing then it has potential to be a really enjoyable game , won't be the best out there but will provide much fun which is what games are all about."

Having played a number of fishing games, I had high hopes for this as I enjoy Call of the Wild: The Hunter.

The open-world approach is brilliant, similarly to The Hunter. However, there doesn't seem to be the same level of fishing detail here as there is hunting in The Hunter, which is quite strange as the is targeted as a fishing game.

I've only played for a short while, so please correct me if some of these are in the game but I've not encountered them.

1) Float fishing: no way of plumbing the depths to determine the actual depth you are fishing at. This is a basic skill to ensure you have your bait at the optimum level just above the riverbed.
2) Can't seem to adjust the length you cast, it always seems to go out to one distance depending on line/bait. So you end up having to cast the reel in to get in closer, other than using the underarm cast which has a very limited distance.
3) No way to clip the line to ensure you cast the same distance.
4) No bank sticks to other rod rests to put your rod on so you can fish with more than one rod at a time.
5) No way to feeder fish
6) No ground bait or catapult to feed a particular area
7) With advances in fishing games, why don't we see the option to use shot on the line with our floats to change the way the bait settles
8) The water physics doesn't seem right. Although floats do move a little, there isn't accurate in flowing water, and they seem very static in that they don't appear to bob up and down.
9) There is water in the boats when standing up and fishing, almost expecting the boat to sink any time.
10) Why is there only one type of boat? Why not have canoes and kayaks.
11) There is no way of telling the time, some watch or SatNav like in The Hunter would be better than the map.
12) The Hunter had a camera function, which would be a nice addition to just pressing F12, so you'd have Zoom and variable focus.
13) Being able to set up a Bivvy, tent or proper fishing shelter would be ideal along with the option for a chair to sit on and watch while you fish. All standard fishing equipment. Plus it could be used to fast forward time if you wished to sleep through the night.
14) An option to find some live bait would be a nice addition, such as digging up worms.
15) Some wildlife around wouldn't go a miss. In particular, birds floating and landing/taking off on the water. IRL swans and ducks do swim up to you, so it would be nice for that to be reflected in the wildlife around the world.

The game is a beautiful world to fish in, it just seems that fishing isn't the aim of the game, it seems more about exploring which is nice, but surely not the aim of the game.

I don't know what if any road-map timeline there is for the future. I certainly hope to see some if not all of the above included, otherwise, this is a major opportunity missed to create the best fishing game on the market.

All that said, I'd recommend the game, but it just feels incomplete and should be in beta stage rather than a final release."

While I've owned this game for some time now, I only just started playing after the major content update a day or two ago. I can't speak for how the game was prior to now, but as someone experiencing it as it is intended as of the new update. The tutorial missions are very well explained, and there's even an accessibility option for normal casting (Which is typically done by pulling the mouse back and then pushing it forward) As I have neither the space on my desk for such motions as well as shoulder issues, the right click and cast load time alternative works wonders for me!

The game itself is relaxing, enjoyable not just as an outlet to play simulated fishing, but also a beautiful hiking game. There are gorgeous places to see and find, even when you're not on the water! The music is soft and uplifting when present, but also fades out to just sounds of nature depending on where you've stopped to rest, much like it does in COTW:The Hunter. And similarly to that game, I wish we could ride horses! Maybe a future DLC? The environment would lend well to such a feature.

As far as the fishing itself goes, there are many decent options for quickly setting up a new rod and tackle, very easy to understand. Unlike some fishing games I could mention, this one is extremely fair- a snapped line does not result in the player having to figure out how much line to add to the rod or apply a new hook or lose a lure you only have one of- Instead, a snapped line simply loses the fish you were after, and I assume any baits outside of lures is probably lost. I was at first a little unsure of the actual mechanic for fishing and where the game expected you to put your hands on the keyboard but once I understood, it's been smooth sailing! I am pleasantly surprised and having a great time. It may not be quite as fun as COTW:TH, but it is still fun! Personally I wish fishing had just been added TO the hunting game since hunting and fishing go hand in hand, but I can also see why they chose to make it separate. Overall great game!"

I can't in good conscience recommend this game in its current state. The marketing for this game is downright dishonest, and whether you enjoy the game or not, you can't disagree with the objective truth that this game doesn't deliver on its promises and should've been released as early access with a discount. It seems incredibly rushed, the fish don't behave as advertised, character creation is awful, and the visuals are just...odd.

From the product description:

Battle a variety of unique species in an authentic and engaging fishing experience. Each fish type has its own set of behaviors and traits, which influence what tackle they’re attracted to, how they fight when hooked, and what actions they can perform to escape. Combined with a system that realistically spawns fish based on water depth, temperature, altitude, and more, every catch becomes a lasting memory.
Master distinct fishing techniques and adapt your strategy to land the most impressive catch. Purchase gear and build custom fishing rigs using a wide selection of rods, reels, lures, hooks, floats, and jigheads. Create your angler and customize their look and attributes. Complete challenges to earn unique rewards and discover the world through meaningful story missions.

I've noticed that time of day, water temperature, depth, bait and lure types, retrieval etc. simply don't matter and fish will either bite every cast or not at all for what feels like hours. The game lists bait and lure preferences for each fish and not only are many of them inaccurate to real life, they seem inaccurate to the game. I've thrown bait that is recommended for fish in front of those fish and they ignore it, then I'll throw some random bait on the hook and catch them every cast. The character creator was just haphazardly tacked on, there are very few options (one hairstyle and hair color for each gender) and the models themselves are mediocre at best.

I tend to enjoy Expansive World's games, but I can't support dishonest and predatory marketing. This is the No Man's Sky of the fishing genre. Either they *can't* deliver on their promises, OR it'll take months or even years for this to be a complete product and it should've been made clear that this is an early access product that isn't worth $30 USD. If they greatly improve the game in the coming months and years and finally make this the genre-defining fishing experience that they claimed it would be, I'll happily change my review. I cannot recommend this game at this time."

PLEASE do not pay attention to the negative reviews for this game, i looked thru all the reviews before deciding to try this game for myself. I love fishing in real life, ive lived and fished in Kentucky my whole life, and ive played dozens of fishing sim games throughout my life. This is the best by far fishing game i have ever played. First day i bought this game i put in 15 hours. anyone that has played this game for less than 5 hours need not even review it. Soooo lets talk about it.
The Good.....
1.Open world, and i do mean open world, you can go anywhere and fish any body of water
2.Multiplayer, its fantastic, never ran into a single game breaking bug at all in 15 hours of nonstop play with
2 other friends.
3.Variety-So man poles, reels, baits, and items to get and work for, there is a money system which you obtain
thru catching fish and completing challenges and none of it is bought with real money.
4.The boats drive very well, though the jeeps are rough im sure it'll be worked on thru time
5.The fishing is so much fun and not ARCADE like at all as some comments have stated. Its hard to find fish and their not jumping in the boat which i enjoy, if you fish in real life at all you'll respect this games fishing mechanics.

NOW for the ""not bad"" but hope gets added

1. i wanna be able to walk around on the boat rather than stand in one spot.
2. when im fishing i should be able to hold ALT to look around without effecting my pole position
3. More wildlife for scenery would be great, Ducks, deer, Raccoons, Rabbits, Ect. just for a more lifelike
ecosystem
4. Vehicles turning is a bit rough and hard to get use to
5. bottom fishing would be a great addition, which again im sure is being worked on.
6. A CHAT. not a quick chat, but i wanna be able to talk to the other fishermen and women that i meet without using pre selected chat options
7. Just a dream here, but being able to pull a boat with a trailer and take it to a boat launch would make this
game so freaking sweet
8. Maybe some foldout chairs for bank fishing that you could customise would be cool as well.

Overall im more than satisfied with my purchase and i don't have a lot of money to waste on games, but i feel this game has earned its place as my favorite game of the year so far.

If you like fishing, come join our community and make this game great for years to come. Great job devs and i hope to see a lot from ya'll in the near future."

Firsts things first: I am a big fan of theHunter: Classic and theHunter: Call of the Wild. When I saw a fishing game set in franchise, I was ecstatic. However, this game is an arcade fisher, which is okay. Call of the Wild is very arcade compared to other hunting games. Its at the very least user friendly and has easy drop-in, drop-out multiplayer with friends. I have honestly been enjoying myself in this game, but I am playing it for what it is.

If you are looking for the next Fishing Planet or Russian Fishing Simulator, keep looking. If you are a fan of the franchise that Expansive Worlds has created and want to invest early in the future of this game, then get the game. We all know Expansive Worlds takes care of their games in the long run... look at both theHunter games. Both were extremely bare at the start, but look at them now. Sure, this game was probably another quarter or 2 away from being releaseable, but they are also not a AAA company. I'm glad that the game itself wasn't a full-priced game ($60) and I'm also glad they decided to put it in a franchise bundle with theHunter:COTW so The Angler was discounted. They didn't have to do that and is honestly why I ended up picking it up instead of waiting for a sale.

The PC fishing community has not been kind to this release, which is justified. There are so many graphical issues and bugs that should have been polished before being released. There is also the issue of not having enough species in the game. That's also an issue considering how many species could easily fit in this game already.

This game has a ton of issues, but because I'm still having fun in the game, I can't justify review bombing it like everyone else likes to. The Devs know what they have to do, and I'll support them the entire way."

I'd like to provide a review that people on the fence might find helpful. I bought this game the first day it dropped and didn't like it at all. The game felt a bit buggy, not optimized well, and even the water looked like oil. (I run a very high end gaming rig) I spent a thousand hours in Fishing Planet and I'm very familiar with titles like this. I LOVED theHunter: Call of the Wild the hunting game.

Well, I refunded this game after about a week after it launched. I followed a Facebook group for a while and a couple of months back noticed people posting loads of photos and talking about how much the game had changed. I re-purchased it and they have did a fantastic job on adding to this game and fixing the bugs and issues. The game is VERY fun now and I no longer have any optimization problems. However, I do think the game still needs more content. More gear, lures, lakes, etc. (Character creation needs additional options as well)

However, I do think the game is constantly adding new things. When theHunter: COTW came out it was very bland. It seemed really fun. But, there wasn't a lot in it. Now, it's ridiculous and loaded with content. I forsee theAngler going down that same path. The game is GOOD NOW and I think it will be great down the road as they get more things added to it. Is it worth the $$? To me it was. I say that as someone who was dissatisfied and refunded the game at launch. It's a much better game now. You'll get your moneys worth and down the road when they add more content, you'll be more than happy with your purchase."

theAngler: Call of The Wild - An Exercise in Good Fun

Looking through the comments and reviews you may see a large amount of people complaining about the graphics, the UI, the lack of AI animals wandering the map, and the lack of what seems to be ambition from the developers, but if you look just a little past those issues which were dated to between months 1-11 of the initial release and have been improved by the time 2 years later they finished the console port (yes, they did a console port, what I wager is the main reason updates might have been slow; they were working on that little, small, minor undertaking of reformatting the game to run on a Xbox and PlayStation) you find a game that does exactly what is promised on the box:

You can fish in every little puddle and cup of water on the two massive open world maps, regardless of the level of success you may encounter, and never be forced into being social with randos while doing it.

You get to explore an open world filled with collectibles that have little blurbs of fun stories that tell interesting narratives when you cobble them together in order once you find them all, coins from all different eras, and even souvenirs that serve no purpose other than to be bought and admired once you max out your in game items (Or worn, in the case of the Bigfoot outfit. Yes, they give you a Bigfoot shirt with rippling muscles and copious amounts of fur. What more could you ask from a game studio?)

There are trails to walk for eons as you wander between campsites, items to pick up as you explore to unlock outposts and vantage towers, and plenty of charm to be found in a very helpful and kind player base that in my experience is quick to share a laugh and even quicker to offer aid and advice.

The fish are just straight up everywhere, as long as you use the right baits/hook sizes/lures for what you’re trying to catch. Just because you CAN use the 4/0 frog doesn't mean you’ll catch something with it

The Multiplayer Experience, Sponsored by Red Bull's Stunt Team:

When people move from a game that has had well over 8 years of work and support to a new project by the same company, it can many times lead to disappointment as the team working on ""YOUR FAVORITE GAME™"" aren't the ones in the company tasked with bringing this new project to life, and that's a whole different can of worms to dive into, but at the end of the day you get a great fishing game to play while in a VC with your buddies, as you all try not to fall off the boat because you turned off the safety measures and did a corkscrew jump off a pile of rocks. Oh yes, the multi-player.

When you think about multi-player games, you often think of shooters, Mil-sims, and Minecraft. And no one blames you, but this game has a very interesting take on the format. You and a handful of random players are dumped unceremoniously into the reserve, with no forced interaction. The games in game chat has a character limiter, but it has enough to chat without VC, and if you absolutely require VC I found discord had no impact on my performance while playing. The in game emotes are both well animated and fun: you can do jumping jacks until the heat death of the universe, wave hello, point out that rock ahead of the boat, or cower in fear from Bigfoot (Yes, he is in the game, no I will not tell you where. Get the game and find him yourself)

I have some advice for the like, 2 people who have read this far (I see you and I'm proud of you) and it has to do with kit building for your setups. The reel says what size line it accepts up to. Never exceed that number, and go for the Fluorocarbon line (low vis + strong v.s. abrasion, which you’ll encounter on the bigger fish like Gold and diamond pike or the lake trout/salmon of Norway). The rod also says the upper limits on the test strength of the line you can use with it. Once you build a few rod kits you'll be able to do it with almost zero effort on your part. And baits. Use stuff size 6 to be an equal opportunity angler and use things size 5-3 for more focus on the larger fish in the pond, especially the pike and salmon. And pay attention to what the fish's journal entry says they like, it can make the difference between catching a fish on every cast and getting nothing for an hour (my advice is use Frog 6, it's taken by Pike, Smallmouth, and Largemouth, and those three are in just about every body of water on the American reserve)

And DO THE CHALLENGES IF YOU WANT FAST(ER) LEVELING. There are many that allow you to do Any fish, of Any size, of Any Weight and get rewards in the form of massive EXP boosts for the weekly quests. Yes, the harder the challenge the better the reward, but at the end of the day you don't need to stress yourself out over virtual fish. You have plenty of time for the weekly challenges if you play the game with friends and lose track of time from the hi-jinks they can pull. My personal favorite challenge was the ""96 lbs of any fish"" and the ""Catch 45 of any species"" as they allowed me to fish for what I wanted and enjoyed to catch, which are the Largemouth and Smallmouth bass in record setting quantities and mindbogglingly massive population densities of the fish in a singular section of lily pads on a land locked lake.

Now, I'd like to end off with a quick story about another player, who for anonymity sake I shall refer to as ""John."" Me and John met up by sheer luck because I stated in the in-game chat ""bass are loving the Phrog 6 today"" (Bait type Top-water frog, hook size 6, simplified to Frog 6). John replied ""You're close to a Legendary spawn location, want to give it a try?"" And thus we went like two rednecks to the nearest lake and began trying to catch a 25+ pound Largemouth named Goldstein on rods rated for 6 pounds and line that would barely hold up origami cranes, forget a fish of such mind boggling proportions as the Legendary Largemouth. Over the next half hour we shared a boat, fished the water, and shot the sh*t in the in game chat about game functions and interesting design choices we noticed in our combined 10 levels of experience in the game. We eventually got into discord with each other and began to help each other with quests and finding new spots to fish. We fought 11 pound pike on gear rated for not 11 pound pike, caught collectively about 180 fish between the two of us in a 4 hour period of gaming, and even started to talk about life and our personal experiences. We both got to level 26 before the night grew old and the sun came up and we had to bid adieu to each other. This game, while yes feels empty without any animals wandering around, and yes has small graphics shortcomings, and of course has a somewhat clunky UI, at the core is a functional and very fun fishing with the boys simulator, and I am thankful I get to play it with a player base that understands that about the game, and does everything in their power to ensure everyone they meet and interact with leave with a smile and hopeful a scrapbook full of their biggest catches.

So to the very small amount of you who made it to this part of the review, I have just one thing left to say: Buy the Game now, wait for sale, or try it via a buddy gifting you a key, but for all that is worth anything on this planet:
Join the official discord for theAngler:CoTW, make some buddies, or bring your own along for the ride, and experience the amazing world of Fishing with the Bro’s.

This is quickly becoming one of my favorite games of all-time. Ignore the majority of the older negative reviews, ever since the latest major update the offline experience has been mostly smooth and enjoyable. If you are like myself and grew up fishing, this game will likely be perfect for you. The general topography is brilliant and effectively replicates some the most compelling fishing experiences that you will encounter in North America. The controls and menu system are nearly flawless and what the menus lack in aesthetics, is made up for in functionality. It also has a charm to it that the other fishing games out on the market are lacking and it truly reminds me of trips that I have taken in the past, whereas the other games feel very sterile and arcade-like in comparison. Although some other fishing games have more options (ice fishing, fly fishing, etc.) and maps, they still don't bring me back as frequently due to the overall experience.

It has a lot of potential to be the ultimate fishing experience depending on what DLC and free content updates are released in the future. For this to happen, the game needs a community of people that give constructive feedback and not hyperbolic criticism. With some luck, the disgruntled players will move on with their lives and find another game to care about. On another note... thanks to this game alone, I plan on taking up fishing again next year and replacing my fishing rod which snapped after trying to get a Pike into my boat a few years ago.

Suggested Changes:

- Make the tackle box menus look like an actual tackle box and allow the player organize it as they see fit
- Add additional fishing gear (fishing binoculars, fillet knives, fly fishing rods, ice fishing rods, fishing pliers, sonar, etc.)
- Additional animations, including removing the hook from the fish, scooping them into the boat with a net or hand, etc.
- Trolling while using a boat and rod holders
- Ice Fishing
- Season-based map variants
- Additional shops throughout the map
- The ability to cook your fish over a fire after catching it and eat it
- Allow the player to enter almost every building
- Allow the player to save up for and decorate their own fishing cabin and display their best catches alive in a tank or dead on the wall
- Additional multiplayer features (social, functional and co-op goals)
- Additional reasons to explore the entire map (unique unlockable gear, skins, etc. after collecting certain items around the map such as fossils)
- More NPCs to interact with
- Games within the game to play while in a cabin with other players (chess or poker, for example) to help capture what it is really like to take a fishing trip with family or friends

It is worth mentioning that at the time of this review there have been significant server issues that will hopefully be fixed soon. I plan on updating my review over the coming months as the game evolves."

I will change this review when they update these 4 things.

Legendary fish have set spawn points, meaning once you found him, you found him. What's the point of this big beautiful open world if there's no point in exploring to pursue ""the big one"".

But it goes deeper!

Since their recent fixes because whatever B team or C team Expansive worlds has working on this game, On Golden Ridge Reserve Diamond fish only spawn in certain areas. So basically once you catch a diamond outside a mission you can just screenshot that area and there's no point to fish anywhere else. Again what's the point of this big beautiful open world.

Game still runs like garbage, you see it in the forums, you see it in their official discord. People with beefy computers cant run this game steady, i myself have a 5800x, 3060, 16gb ram, and the game is installed on a 970evo plus ssd. No other fishing games do I have performance issues, the hunter runs fine, my profile is public so you can see the other games I play. None have issues but this game I can't maintain a steady framerate at any scale.

Norway has no diamond fish yet they will give you challenges to go catch diamond fish."

I'm not that far in but i will say. The Developers had put out a survey about a year or two ago where they asked players what they wanted to see as DLC for The Hunter Call of the Wild and sure enough this Game was one of the DLC options for The Hunter Call of the Wild. Which instead of adding fishing to a game that already had a very good outdoors life feel the developers made this Game which rom what i can tell is more or less just a walking exploring simulator with some fishing in it. Its a good looking game don't get me wrong but this should have been a DLC for COTW. It didn't need to be its own franchise or game."

It really feels like the devs got amnesia when they made this game. Seems like they looked at everything that is great about The Hunter COTW and said ""Yeah, let's not do that""

The graphics are meh to bad, the performance is horrible even after a bunch of patches, and the map is empty, ugly, and boring which makes the insane amounts of traveling feel so bad. The actual environment is incredibly sterile and really lacking in variety.

The water physics and look is so bad it's honestly crazy. They have rivers looking like still water, they have rivers running the wrong way, and they have rivers with a lot of elevation drop making no foam or spray.

I really don't understand why or what happened. They clearly know how to make a pretty-looking environment, they did it in Hunter COTW so something is not making sense with how this is looking.

There is a bunch of equipment in this game but its mostly locked behind grindy and frankly annoying quests.

This game is either straight-up a money grab, an early access game sold as a full version, or made by a team without any passion for fishing.

Honestly sad to see, The Hunter COTW made me really look forward to this but it seems like this is a lost cause. The whole game needs a top-to-bottom remaking for this to be good. Hell, they should have combined the two games into one hunting and fishing experience but that doesn't bring in the money... I guess."

This game started out in a place where it had a good backbone but lacked in many ways. But with the recent updates this game has started to shape up into something that could really be amazing if they keep up the quality updates. If you go into this game with the mindset that this is a call of the wild game similar to the hunter call of the wild then i think you will really enjoy it. It is a very exploration heavy fishing game with massive open world maps where you can fish anywhere you want. This was the main draw for me from the beginning and is still my favorite part of the game. The game finds a good balance between realism and fun and is the reason i enjoy it so much. If you are here to chase after the diamond rank fish similar to the hunter call of the wild you will not be disappointed as diamond fish are very tough to get. Even harder than diamond animals in the hunter. The areas where this game lacks currently is the animations of the fish & the way water transfers from waterfalls to slower moving water. Both lack polish but overall don't detract from the gameplay too much.
There also used to be a massive problem where you could catch anything on any lure but in the past 6 months or so they really tweaked that and its much better now.

Now lets talk about the most recent update. The Evolution Update.

The new leveling system implemented with the recent Evolution Update is a very good change as it gives more purpose and value to leveling up than before. The new water system is also a good step in the right direction tho there is still room for improvement. Another major feature of this update was 8 new fish species to Golden Ridge Reserve which was imo the best part of the update. All the new fish are very interesting and have really breathed new life into this map. The new tutorial missions are also a very good addition to the game as they teach you everything you need to know in much more depth than before. Theres also a new token system where you get diamond, gold, & legendary tokens for catching those fish ranks. Those tokens can then be used to purchase the best gear in the game and exclusive cosmetic items as well. This is a change i feel has helped a lot in giving more purpose to those fish as they are no longer just a big fish but also a way to get more gear from the shop. Another thing that will be happening sometime somewhat soon after this review gets posted is the console release of the game. This will bring cross platform to the game which will be game changing! It will be a breath of fresh air to get to play with anyone regardless of platform as there is not a fishing game out that does this yet. Ill likely update this review at a later date after the console release. But i hope that in the meantime this has helped you decide if you want to buy or not! Its a great game if you can overlook the small things i mentioned!"

Do yourself a favor and go into options and turn on Accessibility Cast. That will give you the traditional, SIMPLE casting controls of other fishing games. The default casting is for masochists who love the idea of maximizing their carpal tunnel syndrome.

Already I have some major concerns with this game. I'm giving it a YES for now, but that is a big, tentative ""yes."" I was hoping it was going to surpass Fishing Planet... but it barely surpasses the fishing mini-game in Stardew Valley. I mean... it's an okay game... but... meh."

Okay so I know there is a lot of negative review about this game on this first day of release, howver im convinced most of these have barely played it.

Yes the game needs work, it needs some overhaul on some mechanics and some texture adjustments. There is a few bug here and there.

If youre looking for a hardcore fishing simulator, this is not it, you will be disappointed, if youre just looking for a casual fishing game, then this one is quite entertaining.

Even if the game needs work however id like to point that while the game may not look amazing right now this is an EW game. As an avid The hunter call of the wild player, they have my full trust, and I know theyll make this game into something great through sustained updates. like they did for the hunting game over more than 5 years of continued updates.

These are trustworthy developpers they just need some more time.

Globally i have a positive opinion about the game and I would advise it if youre looking for a chill casual fishing experience"

This game is a huge step down from the Hunter, it feels like your playing an alpha. The environment is terrible, the land is so barren, the water looks bad and the vegetation coverage is awful. It's empty compared to the hunter's lush forests. I was expecting the world to be like the hunter where you would unlock fishing zones with different fish. There is what feels like no real progression and overall a poor experience. The fishing mechanics suck, you cant even see your float, there is nothing to look at. The fish animations are boring, no excitement. There is a lot to write about this game and it's not very good so i'll just leave it at that. Got my refund."

An ok game. Sure, there are better alternatives out there, but Avalanche gave us a big world to explore. It's a bit... empty I guess? They should add animal AI from theHunter wandering around, that would be a nice addition.

Overall, the mechanics work and fish behavior has been improved since launch. Water physics and reflections are still weird as hell but they'll fix that I guess. The Norway DLC is very good and shows a learning curve from the dev team.

Right now, I'd say buy on sale."

So far I have played the game for 3 hours and this is what I can offer from my own perspective. The visuals in the game are good. You do need decent equipment to appreciate the higher settings. The audio comes across as immersive and rather peaceful to be honest. The fishing itself is challenging. Do not expect instant gratification. It isn't that type of game. The map is huge and it is the only open world fishing specific game available right now that I am aware of. The Reserve Staff are a nice touch although the Tackle Shop attendant is a wee bit over the top in her perkiness for my taste but it isn't a deal breaker. Driving was fun. All in all a good outdoorsy kind of game that is worth the price margin."

I had high hopes for this game. It's just ok, but needs some work. It doesn't feel like the developers go fishing. Here's an example: it makes you set the hook while using a spinner. in my 30 years of fishing I have never had to whip my rod back while spinfishing. It just feels like an arcade game gone wrong, but with amazing graphics! Here's what I would like to see fixed before I could give it a positive review:
1.More realistic fishing(such as the above mentioned issue)
2. You should be able to move once you cast, that adds a lot more fun to fighting a fish.
3. It would be nice to be able to troll from the boat, and there's some weird multiplayer boat issues.
4. Fish should tire out easier, sometimes I'll fight one for 10 minutes and then they get super strength out of nowhere and run the line all the way out.
5. I feel like the tackle should be reworked as well.
I'm hoping that this game can get past the stage where it is now and become something of quality like theHunter: Call of the Wild is."

EDIT: After 1.02 patch the water looks much better.

So, after some 92 hours in this game I've decided to say some stuff. I'm not a fisherman and never really cared for it. I was looking for something new to waste my time on and bought this and the hunter bundle for 25% off. Tried this one first and... wait for lame dad joke... Got hooked. Still haven't played the hunter yet. I immediately noticed that it was more arcade than sim but I didn't let that stop me. I thought the map was similar enough to one of my favorite places on this planet and that was good enough for me. Some say it looks bad. I disagree. Some say they couldn't catch a fish and gave up asap to get their money back. Well, I must've been catching their fish because I'm slightly shy of 1,400 fish caught. I've even gone on several streaks of catching 2, 3 maybe even 4 fish in a single minute. Maybe I just don't know what a good fishing game is since I haven't played one outside of RDR2 or Far Cry since the SNES days. I like the game and yes it needs work just like any new game in the past decade or so. I'm not completely finished with this game yet. I have a few exploration things to find like dino bones and petrified trees and a few longevity achievements. Everything else is done. It's hard for me to actually say how good it is but I feel I have gotten my money's worth and I had fun playing it most of the time. I will say that the water doesn't look great up close (it almost looks like a clear film with wrinkles is on the surface that doesn't move) but from maybe 10 or 15 feet away and further it looks really good. The fish models look good enough to me but their animations are lacking especially when they turn for a lure and look like they're confused at times about how to get to it. If you cast far out, the first fish in range will lock on and will not let any other fish go after the bait unless you speed reel and outrun the fish then another fish will lock on and chase it. I find it frustrating when it's either full cast or a 30 foot toss with not much control in between for precise distance casting so when going for a particular fish it can require some thinking ahead and figuring out the best way to get the fish you want. I play with a controller so I don't know if this is an issue with mouse or not. Precise cast controls would be my most requested update along with an optional center screen dot to know exactly where you're aiming even though I've adapted and usually get close or spot on with my accuracy. Camping/sleeping with the ability to pass time would be a necessary element. The character creator is probably the most bland I've seen since PS1 but because it's only first person I guess it doesn't even matter. 3rd person option would be better in nearly every way outside of actually fishing. Driving a jeep or boat in 3rd person would be a major upgrade when going up hills and in the tight blind turns in heavily forested area's. The signs along the roads need to go. They serve no purpose and even the best driver's will crash into them because they're 6 inches off the roads. They don't exist in Yellowstone and they shouldn't exist in this game, and that also goes for the unused upside down boats, docks and some other useless things that look like filler that are laying around. I would like to see some functional geysers, fumaroles and bubbling mud pools in the hot springs area and some scattered about the entire map because that's Yellowstone! Most bodies of water there you can't even use a boat but they are needed in this game so I can let that slide. I could get picky about lots of other things like no animals and that annoying lady that won't shut up every time I see her but I'll end it here for now. I would assume expansive worlds will fix and add stuff over time like I've heard about the Hunter game and I applaud them for what they have created because of my personal connection with Yellowstone National Park and my love for hiking and exploring there. Like I said, I'm not a fisherman. But, I believe that I will be taking it up very soon and I will credit this game and my old long gone hero for stirring my spirit to become one. If you read all this BS and care to give the game a good try(past the tutorial) and wanna catch some fish and chill in some beautiful scenery then I say buy the game and play it."

Cannot recommend in current state.

This game should have been DLC for COTW: Hunter. They tried to turn a fishing game into an open world explorer except there is nothing to do in this open world. So they force you to play Park Ranger and look for invasive species or other issues in the park, granted that isn't a bad idea but there is nothing else to do but blindly drive around to each location: complete task: move on. The environment is ugly to look at and otherwise unrewarding to explore. There's a whole lot to do but none of it is enjoyable.

Tutorial: Isn't terrible, it explains how each mechanic works. But the casting system and fish hooking system is atrocious. With casting there's no skill, just need high mouse sensitivity or you're not going over 15m. To hook a fish all you do is cast and any fish will go straight to the hook like it's a magnet. Which isn't bad, since you don't want people sitting and waiting to attract a fish for 30+ minutes like in real life. Just don't animate the fish moving statically from 50m away making a beeline straight to the hook, it looks lazy.

Graphics: It's a Hunter game, looks like every other one but somehow character models are worse and the clothes are terrible.

When people buy a fishing game, they want to fish. When fishing in the fishing game is both unrewarding and unenjoyable then why call it a fishing game?

Updated to reference new map DLC: Officially more expensive than a map in Hunter: Call of the Wild with less features in it. Not the move in a game with only an average playerbase of 150"

I went from level 1 to 15 without fishing. Just drive the jeep around.

My thoughts exactly echoed my Megneous:
(Refunded, but I will buy it after it fixes some core issues)

""I refunded it after 1.5 hours. The environments are not impressive graphically, not as immersive as theHunter, the graphics for the water honestly look like someone just learning how to make a game for the first time. It's hard to believe this was made by the same people who made theHunter Call of the Wild.

Additionally, all the game seems focused on exploration... instead of, you know, fishing... when this is supposed to be a fishing game. Only 12 species to fish, a small amount of equipment, and meaningless leveling system all point to this being a barely thought out cash grab instead of a full game. Look forward to tons of expensive DLC to make this an actually playable game, I'm sure. To make it all worse, the fishing mechanics are bad and just not fun...

There are no words to describe how disappointed I am. I was really looking forward to this game. Such a shame the devs ruined that opportunity."""

Since I own COTW, I was able to buy this game for about $20.00. When I first started it up, the graphics were a little wonky, but as soon as I turned off v-sync and anti-aliasing, the game was smooth as well as beautiful. I agree that the game still needs a little refinement, but if you know anything about Expansive Worlds, then you'd already know that is likely at the top of their agenda. In COTW, there were DLCs for different geographies and animals, and I hope Expansive Worlds does the same thing for this game. In my opinion, this is a very affordable and enjoyable open-world game as it stands, and of course, it has huge potential."

The depth and breadth of the Park offer so many challenges for a fishing family separated by time and space. My Dad is is 90-ish I am late 60's my daughter younger. We live too far apart to see each other much more than a couple times a year if we are lucky.

But now, after 52 years, 3 generations of my family are exploring and fishing together once again.

Other fishing games have parts of the fishing thing that are done better. But the thing is, they do not have this exploration element that gives you such a complete opertunity for the kid to say, hey see that lake way out west where we gotta walk half an hour to get to, or the old man to say, I found aspot where you catch 3 pounders every cast... come on I'm driving.

I have played The Hunter since I first saw it for several years. We are not hunters, we are sailors and fishermen, but also explorers. I am a marksman in The Hunter, but have like 8 trophies after thousands of hours. I just am not a hunter, but I am well and truly a fisherman that spent 50 years exploring the deep florida wilderness fishing by canoe, and now am no longer able to be physically safe in a canoe.

I don't know what to say, how to explain it. Call of the Wild: The Angler has given my family a precious gift. The scenery is lovely, and we can put 4 in a boat... and drive for hours together.

Coming from the Hunter what did they do here. Atrocious performance, atrocious UI, looks worse then Hunter and $13 for the second reserve which should be in the base game is preety bad. Is this actually the same company cause doesnt feel like it? This feels less quality then a single reserve in The Hunter, A Lackluster 30$ DLC sold as a full game.
After giving the game a full shot with 10 hrs plus now I will say the idea is the best a fishing game could have however my review stands with some POI for the devs, If u can purchase the game and dlc on sale will give a some fun but the lack of fishing mechanics (not reeling types) Fly fishing, bottom fishing with feeders (Hunter had calls and scents, why no feeders) and trolling plus no rod stands or boat rod holders. No weights for ur lines. No tents for set up quick travel like the hunter and no perk or skill system when leveling. Boat and vehicle need 3rd person plus acceleration control, DLSS/AMD FSR may be a good start for performance, get rid of the confirm catch mechanic(maybe a net for large fish nothing for small), jeep feels to sluggish the second ur going uphill, Add blow up boats/kayaks u can carry in ur backpack for quick access to the lake and the smaller lakes with no boat access (much lower speed though) just for fishing further out not travel. Maybe a few Ai animals as well roaming around, the world feels a lil dead.. UPDATED new update just concerns me more considering everything i mentioned has not changed."

LONG RANT

Just get Ultimate Fishing Simulator, check back in a year to see if they've fixed this. I just don't know who this game is for (presumably the 5 people who have left positive reviews?). It's a fishing game where 90% of the time you're not fishing. This is a Pawnstars meme, ""I'd like to fish"" ""Best I can do is driving for 3 hours with the jankiest vehicle controls this decade"".

The graphics are... fine. People are complaining about them but it's fine for a niche market like fishing games. The exception to this (oddly) is the water. Terrible blur and you can actually SEE the texture tiles because if you turn 45 degrees to them, there are seams. The character models are absolutely awful too. Graphics are not what is holding this game back though.

Audio is a much bigger issue than the graphics. This is the worst audio design I've ever seen in a game. All of the not-nature sounds need to be removed. The vehicles are the worst. Put your head in a cardboard box then run a vacuum cleaner on the top of the box. That's what being in a vehicle sounds like. I hate to use ""cringe"" as an adjective, but every spoken word is so... cringe it deserves a pass. Voice acting sounds like semi-competent actors doing their best with the pile of crap dialogue they were given, so still not great.

Gameplay is another huge issue. This is a FISHING GAME. This isn't CotW: The Hunter, we don't need miles and miles of roads and mountains to explore. We need lakes and rivers. There's one store on the whole map. The quest giver moves around the map at various times of day, so you get to try to track him down every few hours if you do a quest. You're trying to do too much! Just make it a good FISHING GAME! Collectibles!? Is this 2006? Everybody alive hates those. At best it's something you never complete, at worst it's something you begrudgingly find a guide online to collect them all for your precious achievements.

Bugs. There's many. Presumably they'll be fixed after this title leaves it's unofficial ""Early Access"" phase. You know, when it's a real game.

The fixes I'd like to see:
-Get rid of every bit of manual exploration. Unlock the whole map right from the beginning, triple the number of fast-travel points. People can still go climb a mountain if they want a pretty view, but people that want to FISH IN THE FISHING GAME can just get to that.
-So many more fish/locations. It took a truly impressive amount of testicular fortitude to call this ""genre-defining"" with 12 fish species and one map in your game. Ultimate Fishing Simulator 2 is in Early Access and has 5 or 6 maps and dozens of species. You do get that the fishing is why people buy this game right?
-Rework or even do away with dialogue. Make it text if you can't be bothered redoing the audio. The last thing I want in this whole world is some old guy blabbering on in my ear every 5 steps I take. It's not necessary.
-You have to physically go to the only shop on the map to get new gear. This should be a menu option. Yay you made some money, now spend 30 minutes fast traveling back to the shop and then driving (with the game muted) back to your fishing spot. Screeeeeew that noise.
-Get rid of the jeep. Add fast travel points as mentioned. This is the least-pleasant driving experience I've ever played. Vehicles handled more reliably and accurately in the original Twisted Metal clear back in the 90s. I cannot believe that a single person drove that jeep and said, ""Yeah, nailed it"". Also, if you're going add signs/posts every few feet along the sides of the roads, you have two real options: 1) make them destructible or 2) be able to drive through them. Every time the awful controls had me drift half an inch to the right and my vehicle was brought to a full stop from 60mph on a little sign, my rage grew.
-Underwater cam. I mean... that's a gimme.
-Fix your controls. Why is everything a HOLD E? Want to get in the car? Hold E. Want to talk to the shopkeep? Hold E. WHY!? Just tap the freakin button and do the freakin thing!! Why have you gone out of your way to make things unnecessarily difficult? Why is the ENTER key a default keybind? Have you played a computer game in your life? Where are your hands? Are they near the ENTER key? THEN WHY IS THAT ONE OF THE MOST-USED KEYS!?

This game is so bad it made me angry. Not at the lost money, I have hundreds of terrible games on my Steam list. Mad at the claims they've made. ""Genre-defining"". Not released in Early access (which it clearly is). Mad that you inevitably start pumping out paid DLCs before fixing any of this crap, just like you did with The Hunter. Mad at the lost potential, the money and time that made this game could have made a good game."

I bought this game after the initial tease and release knowing full well what I would get in for. I was on the Discord during the first few weeks of Youtubers getting early access and I made my points clear on it there and sadly I will raise most of the points I had there - here.

As someone who played a lot of call of the wild and thehunter: classic I know how beautiful the worlds Expansive Worlds can make there games. I also know that the games they develop are more 'Arcady' than what is expected from most people may expect, but as someone who has fished since I was a child it hurts so much when I play this game and know that is can be improved upon. Unfortunately, that it isnt just the issues with the fishing aspect but the entire game. So I will break this down into Realism issues, gameplay issues and general issues I have with the game.

Fishing Issues:
-It is a shame that a game which focuses so much on animal welfare doesn't actually care for the realism people would use for tackle. There is nothing stopping me from using 25kg (55lb) braid to catch a fish which may be under 1kg (2.2lb). The game solution to this is to give you a score the lighter the tackle and bigger the fish - the higher score you get. Which is how I managed to get a score of 14899 on a ""Gold ranked"" rainbow trout which took 12 minutes to bring in. This was early on in the game and after getting diamonds, this still is my most fun I had. The issue is there is no incentive for people to use light or realistic tackle on fish because as long as the fish is above a certain weight, you could get a diamond. Which is the complete opposite to The Hunter: Call of the Wild where if you blast a small animal with a big round you will potentially not get diamond rank. I have no idea why this doesn't follow the same methodology because Call of the Wild requires a bit of skill and to not brute force your way through the game.

-Penalties for fishing around objects. This is a simple one, why is it okay for me to cast into some lilies or next to a post and catch a fish like it was nothing? Either make the line snap more easily or add a ""Weed/vegetation"" mechanic where your hook gets caught in it.

-Penalties for losing gear. Why is it okay for me to lose hooks when I cut the line or get a fish which is too big for my line like it isn't an issue? I know it might be annoying but that's why you buy a packet of hooks and not one hook from a shop.

-Fish spawning, it is really weird that the game basically tells you where diamond ranked fish are. For people who do not have the game, it is basically a quest for each fish. It tells you to take a picture of 'x' location. Once you done that, hundreds of gold rank fish will spawn and eventually a diamond will appear. Once you caught it, they all disappear. I can argue that one diamond in a mission is nice to get you 'HOOKED' (haha get it?) into the game. However the hunting games do not do this and it is so rewarding when you get one and not for it handed to you on a plate. I havent caught a diamond in the wild but I really hope I do, however before I do that. I will do all the missions and get a free diamond, just so the experience of getting a wild one means nothing to me. :)

+Some people say it takes ages to catch a fish, I am sorry that they dont understand how fishing works, but it isnt an issue to catch a fish, and it is quite nice that it can take a few minutes to catch one. Feels more realistc.

Gameplay issues:
- Driving sucks, thankfully you dont do much of that.

- Boats suck, I am not even american but I know that you probably don't use speedboats to catch fish. I believe boats generally get radar or something to find fish in deep water.

- The world is beautiful, I love it. However - The developers have a game which has animals in it. Borrow some of those models to give a bit of life to the game, that would be cool, it isnt hard you are professionals of your job ctrl+c then ctrl+v.

General / My Issues issues:
-Character customisation sucks, I know I dont see my character much, but when I do I will be taking a picture of a cool fish.

-Speaking of fish I love how each fish has the same patterns, no differences at all just big fish, small fish.

-The Hunter: Call of the Wild has a hunting lodge, this is where you can show off your trophies. Expansive Worlds know you'd think that would be cool to have an aquarium of sorts. They'd probably think it would be cool too, but having it in the base game would mean they couldn't sell you it as a DLC. (I remember when they said they wouldnt sell micro transactions in The Hunter Call of the wild)."

To be honest, I have no clue about fishing.
I bought the game because the environment looked pretty in the screenshots and because I like exploring and taking screenshots in games.

For that, it's amazing.

There's a wide variety of environments on the map(s), a lot of lakes, ponds, forests, flower fields, tiny houses, secrets to find and discover and I'm a sucker for those.
That's what sold the game to me.

A negative aspect is that there's almost no wildlife, besides the fish, some birds that are glued to the watchtowers, some butterflies, that's it.
There are animal sounds in the background, but you never see any of these animals. This makes the world feel artificial and sometimes like a pretty but dead nuclear wasteland.

One can drive around in a car that is kind of clumsy, gets stuck at every tiny obstacle and struggles uphill with only an average speed of 20 km/h. Or, one can drive in a boat, which is okay, I guess, but still feels like riding a bus on water.

I'd like to see quads to drive around, like in theHunter Call of the Wild, or horses to ride, which would make much more sense in this environment.

Since I mentioned that I have no idea about fishing, all I can say is that it feels tedious and boring to me. I can't imagine how people can do that in real life, for hours, but everyone has their preferences, I guess?
Nevertheless, for the quests and challenges to progress it's okay.

Graphically, I think it's the same engine as theHunter call of the Wild, which is nice, but feels a bit dated in 2022. Fire, trees, and some of the ground textures look hideous and pixelated in 4K.
Overall they've made the best of it and the game still manages to provide a lot of gorgeous screenshot material.

I still wish there were a few more graphic options, like a higher drawing distance, a proper photo mode, or at least a way to hide the HUD icons.

If there is an active quest selected the task is written in GIANT BOOMER FONT all over the screen, which is also kinda annoying.

I'd love to see an update for the game that adds options to: Disable Hud, Cancel Missions, First and Third person camera change for the vehicles, proper name detection instead of ?????, Backpack upgrades, even more things to discover, Horses to ride, a lot more visible wildlife on the map. AND: More maps!

If you've got time, maybe some more character customization options."

Frankly i want to like this game, i am a huge fan of hunter cotw. But this buggy nasty broken mess is simply a pass.
Basically if the game crashes at all (or in my case crashes your entire computer) there is a VERY high chance that all your progress is lost and you have to start from scratch.
Its probably due to the fact there is basically only one save file, and tech support is useless, simply sending you copy paste answers and then offering me a save file that has a bunch of money on it. HOW ABOUT FIXING THE ISSUE INSTEAD.
If you dont have this, then save yourself a massive headache and check back in on it in 3-6 months, hopefully they fix it by then."

Welcome to The Angler. There are 2 maps with a combined 33 species of fish, of these you will catch 6.
95% of the time these will be tier 3 or lower ( 5 tiers).Of the rest 95% will be gold. wouldn't be a problem except gold and diamond fish are the coin of the realm.
you have 2 choices
a. fish small hooks and catch rubbish or get snapped off.
b. fish big hooks and stare at your screen for hours while nothing happens.
Save your money and buy a kid's magnetic fishing game

Since my review there has been a 3rd map released, an extra dozen species or so. Every waterhole i've been to has been full of small Rudd. So same problems, just different scenery.
you may have noticed that since my first negative review i've kept on playing. Times are tough and i can't afford another game. as i endure my advice to would-be buyers is the same ......... RUN. wish i was richer"

I mean.... I like it

Call of the Wild: The Angler feels like a pretty chilled out experience, looks great (the water looks dreadful, that needs fixing) and has plenty to do, I haven't fished for years so I honestly can't comment on how realistic it feels but its fun to do.

Worth getting if you like chilled out experiences, you can also hike and do quests for people if you want something more than just fishing."

Similar to Call of the Wild TheHunter, this is not a simulation. The game mechanics focus on fun rather than realism. The map is huge and you can find your spot and settle in for some relaxing fishing.
This is the same developer as Call of the Wild TheHunter who are passionate about their games and regularly update in response to community feedback. One of the most requested feature for TheHunter was to include fishing in that game. The developer found it would be a better experience to create a separate game for fishing. I look forward to watching this game grow as it has a lot of potential."

EDIT: Devs are heavily deleting various comments on Steam and Discord which they dont like, including mine. I just wrote that fish behaviour is done better in UFS 2 than in Angler and the comment was deleted. AVOID THIS GAME AND COMPANY! This is just unacceptable. They even lie, as they made a statement that are not deleting any comments in which we compare Angler to different games, but then they ban you for the very same thing...

ANOTHER EDIT: I was just BANNED from Angler steam forums, for pointing out above mentioned.. :)

In my 35 years of gaming, this is by far the worst experience with any game developer.. Lesson learned, never buying any product from this company again!



------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Same unfortunate release like Way of the Hunter.. In other words, lets release semi-broken game, take your money, and keep fixing it for another year in order to be playable..

+ One of the most beautiful words I have ever seen in a PC game
+ Diverse bioms to fish in
+ Has a lot of potentional, IF devs sort things out (which they wont IMHO considering how they react on forums/discord,etc - they are satifsifed as it is)


- Lying devs who heavily censor Discord/Steam forums without proper reason (mentioned any different fishing game in your comment = delete)
- Only one map at release
- No leaderbords/competitions/tournaments
- Line interaction with water is very strange, meaning wrong, very wrong in fact. For example, I am fishing at very small pond, hook a fish, it says it is 36m away, but the line goes straight down into water just a meter from me, like if he fish was 30 meters directly under me. Which is nonsense, because there is like 10 cm depth near the shore where I stand.. It is just completely out of proportions and literaly cannot/shouldnt happen.
Or, I was fishing at a very narrow river, caught a diamond Lake Trout, but during the fight, he took about 40m of my line.. What?? That river was like 3-4m wide and about 6m deep.. And again, the line he took went straight down the river just few meters ahead of me.. Is there wormhole to another dimension..???
Or, when you float fish, and your line is not tight, and you start reeling in, your line starts to tighten but at the same time float with the bait is coming to you too.. which is nonsense, you need to have tight line first in order for float to start coming to you.
- Water reflections are quite ugly and blurry (devs acknowledged that), which is very unfortunate, considering it is fishing game and you are looking at it all the time... (edit: fixed in a patch)
- Fish behaviour is completely stupid. You can see many fishes right under the water, for like 50m away, and when you cast a bait , they will follow it, but INSANELY slow, like they are on drugs.. It happens every time. So you have to wait like one minute for a fish to swim one meter to catch your bait... This needs some serious tweaking. Imagine in real life , seeing a pike following your minnow, which is one meter away from the pike, for like 30 seconds until the pike reaches it, because the pike is just that slow..... You almost fell asleep during that in this game. It seems like all fish in this game are totally hypnotized by your bait..
- In just a few hours, I was able to buy best rods, reels, etc. Just by traveling the map and getting gold for exploring and level up. Almost without any fishing.
- many times when you pull light fish on stronger rod, towards the shore, they basically fly above the water when you do the rod-up manevour
- sounds are off. When fish is on the line and it jumps during the fight, there is no sound of splash whatsoever
- Absurd character customization (either be bald, or blond, thats it.. wtf?)
- inventory limited to 30 items only, without any option to increase it.. Tackle box says anything to you, devs? You have to go to your storage all the time and micromanage everything.
- some locations on map are completely broken, in a way that all baits/lures/floaters sink immediately to very bottom
- on map, you cannot see names of the lakes/rivers, for some stupid reason.. Why?? Plenty fo quests tell you to go to certain location, like Ruby River, but on the map, you have no idea where it is.. You have to look it up on forums/discord.
- cannot skip time, you have to play through the night...
- no full screen option (only borderless and windowed, why??)
- either I am stupid, or there is no way how to control lenght of your cast.. No matter what I do, your cast is always very long.
- car driving model is a joke, but hey, it is a fishing game.. ok
- fish fighting seems like from a mobile game.. not enough animation and those which are there, are very simple and doesnt give you the correct feel that you are fighting a fish..
- unintuitive or bugged quests.. for example, one of the tutorial quests tells me to equip items for bluegill fishing. Ok, I check my journal to see what bait is used for bluegill fishing. Now, if I equip such a bait(tried all baits suited for bluegill), quests doesnt react and still tells me to equip correct gear.. I have no idea what to do now to progress that quest. I have to look at forums, discord, etc, which is a bad sign for the game.. (edit:"" had to use completely different bait than journal tells you...and it happened for Golder Trout quest too, I have a feeling those quests are completely bugged) And that applies to many things in the game. There is just not enough explanation for many things.
- no trophy lodge/photo album (I guess they will do it later and ask money for it, like in COTW)
- when looking at fish in your journal, you can see what bait is usual, but you cannot see what lures are usual.. Why?
- fish journal and fish tutorial are contradicting themselves all the time. For example, when we take a look at Rainbow trout, journal says you should use dough, bread and barley as a prefered bait. However, when doing Rainbow trout tutorial, it says you should use spoon and leech....
- cannot abandon quests. So, if you started some quests which is very hard to finish (because you miss equipment and are without gold, or whatever), you are stuck with it until you complete it..
- you have to set multiplayer mode off EVERYTIME you launch a game, if you want to play solo..
- at night, I cant see s***. We need some bigger/better light. I cannot see where I am even casting or where is the shore even, etc.
- in general, baits/lures doesnt seem to matter much right now, or the spinning technique you use (constant, stop and go, twitching, jiggling..) It seems that constant spinning with spinnerbait is a way to catch everything now...
- there is a ""Reputation"" level aside your Experience level. But nobody has any clue what it is for or what it does. You can get reputation but completing challenges, but reputation doesnt give you any advantage/rewards.


There are many people complaining that we are review bombing the game.... For you guys:
You need to stop being blind fanboys and stop supporting companies which grab your money and give you half-finished product. You are the reason why companies get away now with releasing such bad products.

I hear arguments ""it has been out only for a few days, stop complaining"". This argument is just nonsense. Firstly, first impression matters a lot. If you do a lot of damage on day 1, it is hard to get your trust back. Also, it is just not right. Let me ask you one thing. If you buy a new car, and on your way back you find out that wheel is not turning as it should, engine does not have the power as stated in specs, half the cars color is missing/scratched, you are unable to roll down the windows, you cannot use the lights, etc.. Would you be fine with that? If car seller told you ""cmon, you just have it for one day, you need to wait half a year before we can fix it for you"", would you be ok with that? I seriously doubt that.."

This game doesn't deserve the amount of negativity I'm seeing in comments and reviews. There are definitely issues, bugs, graphical oddities, and the like. The game is still very fun with all of these present. In it's current state it is a good base for them to expand upon going forward. The open world aspect alone is quite enjoyable. Cruising up a mountain road and stopping at a waterfall to fish for a bit before descending down the winding path and finding a bigger tributary to cast into is incredibly peaceful, and it gives me the feeling of hopping between fishing spots in real life. It's disheartening to see the amount of negative reviews from people who have barely played 30 minutes of the game. If you're looking for a chill, relaxing, more casual fishing game with varied fishing spots and scenery, there's a good bit to love here."

(Game update came out on Aug. 16 2023 adding and overhauling stuff. Will update the review after I put some time in it.)


Call of the Wild: The Angler is a game I want to enjoy, I try to enjoy, but I am no fisherman. I want to recommend this game, but it doesn't feel finished, let alone polished. Let me explain

Expansive Worlds other products, The Hunter: Call of the Wild or The Hunter let you pretend to be ""a hunter"" instead of ""a fisher"". The thing is, those games do a fun simulation while understanding they are a game. They give tools to help us locate animals, they explain the scoring for when you bag an animal. And even if you don't know what your doing at all, the game tries to align you into playing right. The Angler doesn't really have that. Game is fun to walk around, enjoy nature and explore the map... BUT that isn't fishing. The actual ""fishing"" is a convoluted mess of rods, techniques, lines, bait, and location.

You can buy assorted rods, I am sure they have different values but it is all moonspeak to me and the game doesn't explain it well. You buy reels, some reels don't attach to some rods, so measure twice before buying. All the hooks look the same, but apparantly they are different sizes, no explaination on what hooks do what.... Lines have colors and material builds, I think the only think that matters is the diameter of the line though...

Scoring is convoluted, you get recommendations in your guidebook on what fish are and what kind of water they like. Again, I am no fisherman, and trying to follow the book just has me scratching my head looking at the map.

I am sure my own ignorance is a high wall for my not enjoying myself, and I feel that is the problem. The Hunter and COTW did a great job of slowly directing the player into understanding ""the game"" and how to improve on you scoring. I also understand this is a product still ""in-development"" and check back on it every update hoping it will be the update that i suddenly ""click"" and start having fun."

DO NOT LISTEN TO THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS HERE.

I am a LONG time theHunter player. Been playing the franchise since Classic was on a website (this will be relevant in a sec).

Did this game have a rough launch? Absolutely.
Did the developers fix those issues? Absolutely.

This is one of the best fishing games I have played. It's a great mix between realism and relaxing fun. The graphics are great, the rod mechanics are great, the fish mechanics are good but could use a little tweaking, there's a really nice selection of gear to use, and I have run into ZERO game breaking bugs. READ THIS: The people giving negative reviews on this game have less than 2 hours on it. How can you make a review on a game when you just got out of the tutorial? lol.

Now back to the very first thing I said, I've been around the EW team for a long time. THEY LISTEN TO PLAYERS. They have a discord channel specifically for content suggestions and another one for bug reports. They WANT to make this game how everybody wants it. So participate!! But be realistic guys. Don't get upset when they don't add your ridiculous out-of-this-world request that would have to change the entire game's mechanics. And if that is the only way you think this game will be good enough for you, then just delete it and wait for another open world fishing game to come out that meets your standards... good luck lol

If you're on the fence about this game, just get it. Get through the beginning stuff and then when you get to where you have to visit all the places, go to each place and fish there for a bit. Do what the game wants you to do! Explore and fish! It's an OPEN WORLD FISHING GAME! And NO you will not catch a fish every cast. You will not catch a fish at every spot you try. THAT'S THE POINT!

If you love fishing IRL, get this game and take the time to learn it. You won't regret it."

Chill game if you want to hang out in virtual nature and do some fishing. kinda like Far Cry 5 without getting attacked by random bears or kidnapped for an annoying story mission every 5 minutes.

Maybe not what you are looking for if you want a hardcore fishing sim, its more about catching fish in beautiful locations and exploring than properly simulating the real thing, though you will still need to put some thought into your setup for catching different fish"

This has gotten a lot of bad reviews and I don't really think they are justified.

First of all for everyone interested in buying: This is a fishing GAME not a fishing simulation. The mechanics are quite simplified and this fills the gap between fishing in games like rdr2/far cry and real fishing simulations.

I played it with a group of 4 players of which two people are experienced anglers in real life, one has just gotten his license and one has never held a fishing rod in his hands. All of us have fun with the game, even tho the more experienced guys feel like the fishing part is a little shallow.

You can get a decent amount of fun out of this game in my opinion.

Pros:
+ Large open world with different places to visit and fish from
+ Vehicles right from the start (unlike the hunter)
+ relaxing fishing gameplay and different fishing methods
+ Graphics are pretty decent with minor inconviniences
+ Not a full price game: 25€ / 30$ (Side note: While there are free alternatives in the fishing simulation genre, they tend to be either very grindy tho admittedly some people like that feel of progression, or you have to pay for stuff within the game with real money)
+ The ambient sounds are good as to be expected from EW

Cons:
- Gameplay is quite shallow for experienced players
- Graphics could use some fixing
- Multiplayer is buggy af. It took as quite some time to get 4 players into the same server
- Some animations are lacking or just plain missing.

Things that should be improved in my opinion:
* Fix Multiplayer
* Fix Bugs
* Add more animations
* Add difficulty settings (removing HUD, options to adjust realism)
* Add some critters to make map more alive (they could literally reuse assets from ""the hunter"" to add ducks and hares :D)

EW is known for adding stuff after the game is released over the following years. Things I would be looking forward to are:
* ""Hunting Lodge"" / Aquarium / Photobook
* Add more quests
* New maps
* New fishing methods (fly fishing, feeder fishing, throwing bait into the water to increase bite rate and stuff)"

Introduction
""Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime."" A familiar bit of wisdom and it is the gospel truth as far as I'm concerned. Feeding is a base need, so how about more complex desires? Unlike hunting, the noble sport of fishing involves almost no violence or risks for those which partake in it. Especially so if you apply the ""catch & release"" rationale as well.

Precisely this method is maintained by Call of the Wild: The Angler in its approach to simulating sport fishing while emphasising a clear message in regards to environmental sustainability. It's the third project for developer and publisher Expansive Worlds. Their previous titles were focused entirely on hunting, so I am glad they branched towards fishing in the meantime.

The base game focuses on a single location in the United States of America. For creative reasons alone, I presume that the developers only inspired themselves from the real life Yellowstone National Park and renamed the new site as Golden Ridge Reserve. Everything else points at a near identical origin to Yellowstone: from the 19th Century inception via presidential decree, to more precise elements such as topography and a map that's bordering three US States (Wyoming, Idaho and Montana).

Golden Ridge has been crafted with attention to detail in mind. It reminds me of Firewatch (located in the Yellowstone Timberland Reserve) since it also features plenty of watchtowers is similar circumstances. The Angler does have a story, in spite of its open ended structure. Clayton Johnson is the Golden Ridge Reserve Warden. A park ranger, if you will. You're his new deputy, a blank slate, silent protagonist that's fully customizable. Clayton will affectionately refer to you as ""Buckaroo"".



Without any time constraints getting in the way, you've been tasked with assisting the Warden in his daily survey activities. This by itself involves exploring the reserve and pinpointing various anomalies you'll undoubtedly find on your path towards the next ideal fishing spot. Side missions contain invasive species and various collectibles, spicing things up when you wish to take a break from angling. The Golden Ridge's shop owner, Sophia Taylor will act as a veritable guide apart from her standard activities regarding the purchase and management of your gear.

The Angler is being powered by an updated version of the Apex Avalanche, a propietary engine developed by Expansive Worlds and used efficiently in their past games as well. Apart from a couple of crashes to desktop which I'll write off as par for the course, given my aging system, no stability issues to report. Frame rate is stable and running the game almost maxed out (I'm always disabling motion blur and depth of field) was a cakewalk even for a 2016 midrange PC.

There's plenty to see in Call of the Wild: The Angler. Simply taking in the sights, finding the perfect angles for a cool screenshot (pressing ""P"" disables the HUD) became a side activity for me. The day & night cycle becomes important from more than just a gameplay perspective. Seasonal events, such as the recently ended Halloween theme, further enhances the locations with new decorations.

The voice acting is passable, while the background noises are emphasizing on the serene aspect of your fishing trips. Add a soundtrack to that and you're on your way to Skyrim, my friend. You know why you're in the Golden Ridge Reserve though. Top notch angling on top of relaxing environments. No dire wolves or frost trolls in sight.



As a simulation performing a balancing act between realism and arcade elements, I wasn't entirely surprised that there isn't an underwater ""chase camera"" while battling fish trying to escape my hooks. The aforementioned barebones fishing mechanics in Skyrim Special Edition won't cut it, Red Dead Redemption 2 was a the middle ground arcade option and it also didn't feature the option to see fish struggling underwater. Perhaps this will be added in the Angler at some point, but its absence is not a deal breaker for me.

Whether you practice your fishing skills with floating baits (a waiting game) or take the proactive luring methods which involve constant movement, the bigger the catch, the more it will fight to escape your warm embrace. Knowing when to tighten or loosen the tension of your fishing line will be crucial to success. Reinvesting your credits (in-game currency, no microtransactions at all) into better gear is paramount. Rods, fishing lines and lures should be your priority.

Clothing items or new vehicle skins can wait until you've got superior fishing gear netting you silver and gold ranking fish. Speaking of which, some of the best fish species ranking-wise, are crepuscular. So your best chances of catching noteworthy specimens, should be around sunset and sunrise. Patience is the key here, but I think you already expected that from a fishing title. Change tactics and fishing spots constantly for maximum efficiency.

Now, this can be a walking sim if you want to ""hoof it around"", but why now try the offroad vehicular option, a Jeep Wrangler lookalike or sailing via speedboats? The latter option is quite useful for fishing in the middle of the lakes and who knows, perhaps you may even meet some legendary critters while you at it. Catch & release only. An aquarium would be a nice idea for a future DLC. Certainly better than mounting a fish trophy on a wall and more in tune with the conservationist message conveyed in the Angler.



It's not the biggest open world for a title focusing on natural exploration, but it's densely packed with details off the beaten path. The full zen experience in a neat package that also involves fishing. Truly, if hunting wouldn't be your cup of tea from a moral standpoint, at least you can indulge into sport fishing with a clear conscience that the creatures you are angling in this entry of Call of the Wild, won't end up on a grill. We're in this for the sportsmanship, not mere sustenance after all.

Update - July 22, 2023 - Still very underwhelming, after another two hours of play, it just feels like work, not overly fun or challenging, and kind of a drag. Issues I had before are still present, and overall, still unimpressed. Will probably try again in a few months.


This game should be renamed ""Call of the Wild: The Wanderer"" or ""The Walker"" Cause it's all you will do. And not for the better.

Absolute lack of fun. You start the game with a 3 ft rod, and a reel that can apparently only hold essentially 2lbs test line. Want to jump right in and go fishing? Nope. Almost every fish I have hooked has been far too large for my starting setup, fight the fish for literally 10 minutes and gain zero line and don't even tire it out a little until it snaps off... and this is at the location they start you at, immediately after the tutorial. Okay, guess i'll go buy some new gear? Nope. Cause you have no money, cause you can't catch fish... alright, so how do I make money and get XP as a new player? Well, there are two ways that I have found:

1. You can fish for micro fish, which essentially are very small large mouth bass or the more common perch. The perch which are about 40 grams in size will net you a whopping 1 xp. They're not even worth the cost of the bait you will use to catch them..
OR
2. You can go the second route, which is to completely ignore fishing and to turn the game into a looooong and dreadful walking simulator. Run around and discover the areas for xp, and look for flowers and diseased trees.... That's right, in this FISHING game, the best way for a new player to level up and make money is TO RUN AROUND COLLECTING FLOWERS...

Make sense out of that. Picture this: You've bought a fishing game. ""Gee I sure can't wait to fish!"" you say, as it downloads. Run the game, play the tutorial, ""Oh, this is alright"" you think. Finish the basic tutorial, keep fishing. Hook something. ""OH BOY! It's fighting!"" Fight it for 10 minutes, playing the drag, trying to pump it, fight it's direction, reel like a SOB, aaaanddddd... wait... is it still 28 meters from shore? Ok... keep going, fish pulls, fish stops pulling, nothing moves, repeat, and eventually SNAP! Lost the fish, lost 20 minutes of your life, lost your bait, that you have to pay to replace, and you got zero XP or money.... ""Gee.."" you think, ""What should I do to make money so I can purchase the standard items I need to actually fish?"" Well, as you run around looking for anything to ease the misery of trying to catch trout using essentially a stick with a piece of hair tied to it you discover a glowing thing.. you approach and it's a flower, you collect it, ""HERE IS SOME XP AND MONEY!"" The game says. And now you're playing ""COTW: The Wanderer"". As you continue walking around and not fishing though you begin to see all the off putting things. Floating rocks, sounds of animals that don't exist. UI issues, terrain that looks so unnatural in it's form and shape that I could have made it better myself in UE5... you finally say ""Well, that's enough of this..."" and you're past the return window, so here rots another game that was released way too early, one that you've now paid for and tried, and have such a sour taste from that you may never try it again...

I've had more fun at the dentist getting a tooth pulled, at least that was exciting enough to make my heart beat...

This is trash. Absolutely no fun. Why must games make new players suffer and struggle and grind to be able to just afford the standard wal-mart gear and be able to play the game decently well and actually have fun.

Now, does the game look good? Yes. Mos things look great, except a few floating rocks, and questionably sculpted terrain. However, remember, this is a FISHING game, not a walking sim. Quit making me be miserable for 6 hours before I can enjoy the game... does it play well? I mean, from the VERY limited fishing I did that wasn't just casting and waiting, yeah it's alright, but the fact remains, when you start this game new, you're going to have a terrible time, you're probably not going to do much fishing (at least not successfully), and eventually you'll get two and a half hours in and realise you've had enough and quit, probably forever or at least for a long time since you've past the return window...

Some more things I don't get, why do some lakes give you a ""Fishing area discovery"" and then tell you what fish are in that water, but most don't. We're talking like, 20% that do. Do the rest of the waters not have any fish in them? Are they just filler for the map? Like, the idea behind an open world fishing game has always been a hope of mine, to be able to go anywhere on a map and cast into anything and see what happens, but this honestly is terrible.

So TLDR:
If you want a walking sim, and to run around literally looking for flowers, this game is for you. If you want to enjoy a fishing game, sit on a dock and catch a few fish, this game is not for you.

WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE:

1. Don't pay to replace bait. Just buy it once and it's there. Constantly replenishing and buying bait is a time and money waster.
2. Better and more actually realistic starting gear. There's no reason why I can't land a 3 pound fish with my starting gear. I'm an angler, i'm trying to fish, i'm not a caveman or a some completely unknowing new fisherman. This game is obviously meant to be more for people who have REAL life fishing experience, so why make them suffer at the start of the game? Give me an actual rod and reel with some line that can actually hold a fish.. not some makeshift smelt fishing setup...
3. More fast travel. I get it, ""open world"" means exploring. But there's just too much space to cover here, it's a buzz killer, or compress the open space. Yeah running around is part of the fun, but at a rate of 10:1 compared to actually fishing, it's just no good.
4. More consistent water body info. If I walk up to some ponds and they have info tabs than all bodies of water should, even multiple for different parts. No fish in this puddle? Tell me that too.
5. Improve the casting. It's weird, feels strange and is way too hard to control or use any finesse.
6. More smaller fish (if you aren't gonna let me catch the big ones until I make a bunch of money...) Really, if you want to force me to catch tiny fish to get money and buy new gear, at least make them easier to find and more plentiful. I get that fishing ins't a guarantee, and an open world game is meant to be realistic, but the fact that it's so dependant on small fish at the start and the fact that you can't reliably catch fish to your ""level"" is frustrating.
7. Severely limit the ""fetch"" quests. It's a fishing game, stop making me run around collecting flowers..
8. Improve the water. Yeah fluid dynamics are hard. Water in video games is hard. But this game should focus mainly on water cause that's where fishing happens. Reeling in a spinner makes the water look like an alligator is about to come out. The fish jumping also looks really strange.

Honestly, there is potential, it's just not there yet. And buying it at this point (specially at full price) will sour you so bad, you won't even want to try it later when it may be better.
Just wait a year or two until it's decent, or maybe get it at a severe discount (I got it at 67% off, still feels like a waste of money right now...)

If you read this whole thing, I truly appreciate you.

Thank you."

This is a great game despite all of the negative reviews!! Sure, what new release doesn't have issues these days. The game is an open world Go Anywhere Do Anything, outdoors recreation game. It is very well done and especially awesome for those of us that do not play shoot and kill games!!.
I love finding the collectables and exploring the mountains. For myself, the 12 varieties of fish and assortment of tackle is perfect. Do not care for competition ""bass pro"" style game. Want the relaxed environment with freedom to play MY WAY.
I just hope the developers stick with this game and ignore all the negative comments.
Thank you for another Awesome game. Looking forward to all the improvements and new maps to come in the future."

this game is a good fishing game when the fish are biting........ the first good stretch of 20-25 hours was great i like it alot but somewhere along the way the fish started to bite less and now when i boot up the game and attempt to fish i get zero bites to the point where i just get upset after about 20 mins of having nothing take my baits. i use the correct tackle and even the wrong tackle. i switch up the target fish and cycle through the tackle but nothing i do results in having fish on. even after finding spread sheets on what is used for what and doing the circle jerk there nothing is working. i can drop a line right on a fish i'm trying to catch with the right tackle and nothing happens. it used to not be this way.
another issue is that the quest fish you're supposed to go catch for the BS reward system don't exist. after 10 hours of trying to catch a single fish not even the tier of fish but just that one specific species they just refuse to give it to me.
on to other problems.... the movement is trash, when you're running straight and hit A or D your character jerks to a stop and instantly strafes left or right. turning feels like a slow motion molasses sham. driving is serviceable but far from good. boat driving is ok but you lack the ability to go slow and make less noise in a game where ""making noise"" allegedly scares the fish away. which i don't think i've seen anywhere in the game but everyone on the official discord says is real.

bottom line is it needs work on the core game. balancing between the tackle needs work. they need to provide actual data in game for what the tackle does. hook sizes have zero info on what weight groups they work for. as well as there is no weight to species data to show what tier the fish are that can be caught. it's all guess work within a network of RNG values."

You know what....I crap on a LOT of games in reviews, but this one doesn't deserve half the crap it's getting.

I spent the last few days playing Fishing Planet and The Angler side by side at the same time, and honestly, The Angler is the one I find more enjoyable.

The actual fishing feels pretty much the same with the main difference being Fishing Planet seems to focus on the strike and The Angler focuses more on the fight.

I also have to give The Angler a win in that the gear system is 1000x better as it's not developed in any way to push you towards buying DLC packs. I have all the rods I need in The Angler, I don't need to buy a rod case. I don't need to get spammed to buy a Boat pack or the newest fishing expedition every single time I go anywhere like in Fishing Planet.

Also, speaking of boats and being spammed to buy things, The Angler has multiplayer and more than just one person can ride in a bass boat. CRAAAAZY. I was about to buy a boat pack on Fishing Planet to haul friends around since I figured ""Eh, I spend a couple bucks and then the game is free so it evens out"" - then I see only one person fits in a boat on Fishing Planet. Well done The Angler, you've put yourself waaaay out ahead for me personally because I love playing games with friends and The Angler seems 100% more geared towards this.

Also, the waterways on just the ONE location you can go in The Angler seem larger than ALL of fishing planet put together. Much sad.

So yeah, would I buy this game again? I think so, I have a feeling the issues with this game are going to be reformed the same way Hunter: CoTW was, so I'm interested to see what the devs do in the future, and $25 for a new game is pretty much nothing these days."
call+of+the+wild+the+angler,Not Recommended,9.8,"Posted: August 31, 2022
Lets start off with this; I have roughly 600+ hours into The Hunter COTW split between PC and console. As a person who actually fishes regularly in real life I was pretty excited for this.

This game is a hot steamy pile of fish sh*t. What the actual f*ck. Expansive Worlds... what are you doing? The game is so lacklustre right off the hop I had to FORCE myself to keep playing it hoping it would get better. Unsurprisingly, it got worse.
I didn't know something could launch worse this month than Way of the Hunter, but congrats Expansive Worlds, you f*cking did it.

This isn't even close to done. It feels like a spruced up mobile game (and some of those have more depth than this). Thanks for getting your community hyped for a boring visual novel of a game. Next go around, we're all OK waiting for a game to be finished before launch.

But there was an FOV slider in the options on launch, so you guys have that going for ya.

*edit: if you rave about this game looking great, mindsweeper must look like a AAA game to you. They had one job. Make water look like water."
call+of+the+wild+the+angler,Not Recommended,55.9,"Posted: May 29
I really wanted this game to succeed. I have alot of time in its cousin The Hunter COTW. This game has a fun fighting mechanic when you get a fish on the hook. But the rest of the game is a mess. Very unintutive AI. Glitchy multiplayer. No choice but to be always online.

All of that can be forgiven. The tutorial missions....are still...bugged....they dont tell you the equipment you need for a species, until after you completed it, or not at all, or sometimes you can have every item in the game and it still wont progress. The game is a year old and the first tutorial missions are bugged, looking at you How to Catch blue gill.

Save 50$, or go to your local store buy a simple spinner rod and catch real fish."
call+of+the+wild+the+angler,Not Recommended,11.9,"Posted: September 1, 2022
The game has potential to be good. For the time being, buy if you wanna support the devs, otherwise you'll find better fishing games elsewhere: RF4 and Fisher Online.

CotW: The Angler feels like an early access game. Poorly optimized, the water looks awful, the fish r too damn slow, the strike mechanic ruins spinning, the fish are tireless leading to stalemates where you gotta cut the line, the fish powers up when you bring them near you, the equipment feels off: I tried a 5kg line on 3kg and 5kg reels and for some reason line will snap on a 3kg reel at 95% friction but it wont on a 5kg reel at 70% friction, feels like they never tested the equipment.

Ill updte the review if the game gets better in future."

As a ""finished product"", what a mess!
Water looks horrible, graphics feels odd compared to theHunter: COTW, game runs badly, movement and menus feel really clunky like a bad console port.
Avoid until issues are fixed!

To be clear though, there are quite a lot of potential, but this should have been in development for at least half a year at minimum.

EDIT: After playing 60 minutes of this, it just feels so raw in many points. Fishing is put aside and it feels like exploration is the main game. Fishing just a little bonus feature that they decided to add to this empty and dead map.
There are so many signs on this that it will be a huge DLC sink in the future and thank you, but I'm tired to pour my money into a game that will be what it should have been in the start after 10 different DLC's.
Will refund and check back later in future sales when I can get some kind of GOTY version with all the DLC's included and at least with 50% discount."

This is a very low effort cash grab. Do not blame the developers, blame their managers. The visuals are way worse than their considerably older titles. The fishing mechanics are very basic and do not promote variety. It is buggy even compared to today's standard. Reacting to biting fish is prompted by arcade style text on the screen rather than through observation of the float, etc.. It is fun for a little while if you've been starving for a fishing game but overall it is really, really disappointing in almost all regards (the models of the fish are done reasonably well but not their animations) . It is not worth your money."

Drawing in this game is dope. You have a nice amount of options and 2 cool gamemodes. The problem lies in the playerbase. Almost no English speaking players. Most of the time I play with Chinese or Japanese people who speak English.
There is a Discord server for this game but the chances of finding someone there who is willing to play when you are is quite low I would say.

If you like to draw with friends I hope they also have the game or are willing to buy otherwise don't bother for now. They can't join in if they don't have the game like in Drawful for example.

I wish this game had more English speaking players but as of right now it is very rare to find someone in the English server. I had to ask a guy in the Japanese server to switch to the English one so that I could understand what is being asked of me to draw. Developer says this might change once they release the game for mobile phones. I hope that will be the case.

I will change this review if the situation changes. Happy drawing."

The new version is a very bad update, there is no longer the old version of the painting experience, I am very disappointed with the current version, and hope that the developers can immediately improve the game experience, the following are the problems I found：
1. In the public room, you can't start the game happily, because there are always people repeatedly entering and leaving the room, which makes it impossible to start the game, I think the game should cancel pushing room information when everyone is ready to start the game.
2. In the new version, if you choose the wrong lexicon or other settings, you can't go back to the waiting lobby in the game, which makes everyone annoyed.
3. In the game, when your brush draws to a location with UI, the brush can't draw properly. This is a bug in the new version, which will cause the full-screen landscape drawing to no longer draw better.
4. When someone quits during the game, the Tab's people list and the chat bar will be disabled to some extent.
5. In a normal 15s~300s painting game, the brush update is the most unreasonable, which is a very serious problem, because in a short painting time you don't have much time to adjust the value, this update is not even as good as the old version's 3 point value, which will make people feel stupid, I hope the developer can restore the old version's 3 fixed brush values in the next update again, or set it as an option that can Let the player choose the option.
6. In the painting game, the ""point"" and ""short line"" drawn by the brush is not very good, can be further optimized.
7. Flash animation will be played at the end of the game, which is more interesting than the old version, but you can't skip it, so it will seem a bit troublesome.
8. The tools used for drawing should not be limited to the mouse, in this update, if the tablet is connected after entering the game, the tablet will not work properly, which is not good for the game experience.

I hope this game can become better because it allows people to meet many friends and lose many friends."

As a Chinese player,I don't think our players should take this for granted.I could have recommend this game to my friends and classmates.But I can't stand those network drops and Internet connection wrongs so frequently.It's hard for me to trust developers who claimed that they had already tried their best to work out these problems.Instead,it seems that they don't really care about players' experience and they are arrogant to us. (Some other foreign players may be included too.)

As far as I am concerned,I don't think hire a team to maintain your servers and gradually improve network connection quality is a puzzle that harder than Goldbach conjecture. After all it is not a intense battle game, a bit higher lag is acceptable.

Now, the only thing you need to do is arrange a server near Asia! It 'll benefit all the Asians and boost your sales as well.

Thanks a lot！"

It's just a very ordinary draw and guess game, nothing special. In the process of drawing, I found that drawing with the mouse is not particularly good-looking, but it is the only option. As a novice, after entering the room to play, I found that this game seems to be very unfriendly to newbies, because I didn't know how to play at first, I just drew a few times, and then I gradually understood the rules of the game. My only dissatisfaction is that as soon as I entered the game, I found that you only draw in simplified Chinese. I guess there is a room. I guess you draw in English. I guess there is no room. I always thought it was because my language was not set correctly, so I kept debugging the language. It was only later that I found out that there is really no room in English. I highly recommend this game, but I also wish there were more rooms in English and other languages to enrich the gameplay."

Suggestions建议：

Paint bucket 区域一键填色?
better color panel, there isn't gray? 没有灰色？
Eraser? 橡皮？
Can't cancel after you clicked finish when drawing 在作画阶段点完完成，想进行修改可是无法取消
More and editable hot keys like Photoshop? 更多可自定义的快捷键？最常用的例如PS里的v移动, b笔刷, e橡皮, L选中？
Round brush? 圆形笔刷？
at the end listing out all images when selecting your favorite drawing? 选择最喜欢的画时, 列出所有作品的预览图是否会比现在点下一张的方法更好？

Please do more research on current existing relevant games. Observe the good and make it better so it won't looks like a scam 请务必思考一下本游戏与同类型其他游戏的问题, 吸收同类游戏的优点, 并加以改进以不至于让这个游戏感觉像个骗傻子钱的.
This game feels like it is created by multiple people that are not on the same page, which some of them have played the games I listed below and know what he is doing but some of them just doesn't care about the outcome. So just go play some similar games and u'll know how much your game is like unfinished. 本作给我的感觉像是一些没有进行深的交流讨论以及制定计划过的人们制作出来的游戏, 感觉某些人是玩过网页上那些类似游戏的, 但有些人制作时完全不在乎游戏过程. 希望那些只听描述没玩过的制作者们去玩玩类似游戏, 你就会知道本作有多像个未完成品了.

I just want you guys to know, that this game have A LOT of potentials!!! so if you guys just pay a little more patience on it, it'll be so much more better. 我只是想让你们知道, 你们的游戏有很多可能性, 只要再耐心一点本作就非常完美了.

As someone who grew up playing LittleBigPlanet, I'll try to be unbiased. After all, this is NOT a LittleBigPlanet game. However, this game is solid in its own ways.

Pros:
-amazing graphics and performance (I haven't had any issues with stuttering like some people are saying and I have a mid-grade at best PC)
-Soundtrack is perfection, possibly the best of the franchise
-not terribly difficult but could be challenging at times
-coop/multiplayer is fun and works smoothly
-controls are fine. I use an Xbox controller and I have had no issues at all

Cons:
-only 1 con and I know I said I wouldn't compare too heavily to LBP but the ability to be creative took a massive step backwards. No moon, no custom levels, and no pod. Also no stickers or decorations. So if you wanted to make hair with decorations like you did back in LBP2 or spam stickers everywhere you can't do that lol.

All in all, solid game all around. If you played LBP you'd enjoy this game. I definitely felt nostalgia playing this. PlayStation, Sumo Digital, and whoever else: pls hear all of us out. Remaster LBP 1+2 (or make LBP4), make it cross platform with PS5 and PC, and allow us the fun customization that we all know and love. There is so much potential to revive this franchise it is literally oozing from the screen. Pls give the fans what they want.

Overall: 8/10"

Let me preface this review by saying, I love LittleBigPlanet. I love LittleBigPlanet more than you could ever know. LittleBigPlanet 2 is my contender for the single best game ever made. I can say with full confidence that nothing that I have played, am playing, or will play in the future, can ever surpass the unbridled joy that I received from playing that game as a lad. And, coming into this game, I lowered my expectations accordingly. I knew it wouldn't, couldn't, be the same. But, if this game could just manage to recapture even a fraction of that joy, then it would be a winner.
This game did not do that.
This game made me actively upset.
Firstly, I struggle to imagine the reasoning behind making this game a tight, ""Super Mario 3D Land""-like platformer when one of the main appeals of LittleBigPlanet is its loose, physics-based puzzle platformer gameplay. In LittleBigPlanet, Sackboy behaves much like any other physics object in the game. He can be flung around, he has inertia, he can be pushed and pulled, he can fall over other objects, etc. Speedrunners of the game have found many ways to exploit the physical properties of Sackboy to pull off some wild movement tech, and the skill ceiling is surprisingly high, despite its simple appearances. What I'm trying to say is, controlling Sackboy in LittleBigPlanet is FUN. Not only that, but it requires skill. You can improve at it. The hard level community in LittleBigPlanet makes a lovely showcase of pushing Sackboy to his absolute limits (for an example, look up ""adsffff"" on YouTube dot com).
Controlling Sackboy in Sackboy: A Big Adventure is not fun. Controlling Sackboy in Sackboy: A Big Adventure is EXHAUSTING. Remember all that stuff I said earlier, about Sackboy himself having physics? That has been completely discarded in this game. Sackboy moves at one (abysmally slow) speed, that you can marginally increase by rolling. Your speed might increase when rolling down one of the few slopes in this game. Sometimes. But don't find yourself having TOO much fun, old chum, because that speed boost you get is often woefully short-lived, brought to its untimely demise by a Bounce Pad lying in wait at the bottom, which will... launch you? No, no, that would be somewhat exciting. The Bounce Pad will gently push you into the air, like a mother pushing her baby on a swing. Many slopes in this game don't have the decency to even give you that release, instead, they make you watch as Sackboy unceremoniously sliiiiides down to the bottom. Oh, and since this game is a platformer, I suppose it's obligated to have a jump, too. I don't think I've ever seen a platformer with a more painfully basic jump. In stark contrast to LittleBigPlanet's jump, which let you fine tune its height down to the most minute level, Sackboy's jump in this game has one height that is achieved by holding Cross, and one slightly lower height that is achieved by tapping Cross. How ambitious! Also, do you recall how in LittleBigPlanet, Sackboy's jump retained his momentum? Well, Sumo Digital must have thought that was just far too extreme for us to handle, so the jump in this game brings you to a screeching halt, no matter how fast you're going. No slope jumps or bunny hopping to be seen here. It's as if the very act of moving himself is a Herculean task for Sackboy. Sackboy does not ""run"" in this game. Sackboy trudges. He struggles to push himself through the soulless wastelands of this game.
I do not use the word ""soulless"" lightly here. LittleBigPlanet 3 may not have been Allah's gift to gaming, but at the very least it felt like a game made by people who had an inkling of passion and respect for Media Molecule's masterpiece. This game feels as if Sony had asked Sumo Digital, ""make a 3D platformer for our PS5 launch, please,"" and the poor employees all begrudgingly got to work, dusting off Sackboy with a look of desolation on their faces. I'd like to pose a question. Do you think, if Sackboy was replaced by a different character in this game, that people would even notice? The worlds themselves are so generic that I struggle to find anything in them that would make me think this game has any relation to LittleBigPlanet. Grass world, jungle world, water world, sci-fi world, Vex world. Wow. Don't strain yourselves coming up with these original level themes, guys. The grass world even had SNOW in it! And, what's that brown, fuzzy creature traversing through these riveting locales?
To be honest, I can't tell you what that... THING we control in Sackboy: A Big Adventure is. But it is not Sackboy. It does not move like Sackboy, it does not look like Sackboy, it does not even attempt to sound like Sackboy. It is a wretched fiend, devoid of heart, wearing the tattered pelt of our old friend, and insisting that it is him. Every time I hear that creature let out a boyish ""hup!"" as it heaves itself into a pitiful jump, my skin crawls. I am in no way using hyperbole when I say that it makes me sick to my stomach. It doesn't matter how many familiar costumes it fastens to itself. It is not Sackboy. It will never be Sackboy.
If you, at any point, loved the LittleBigPlanet franchise, and are thinking of purchasing this game, I have one piece of advice for you. Don't. Stay far, far away. Keep your pleasant memories just as they are, as memories. This game is an insult to Sackboy, an insult to LittleBigPlanet, and an insult to Media Molecule. Furthermore, it is an assault on human creativity, and I am sorry to have played it.
Oh, and the other reviews may have clued you into this, but yes, Epic Games is here. You know, in the Steam game I bought? There's nothing I can say about that that hasn't already been said.
Thankfully, the future of LittleBigPlanet is not as desolate as this game would make you believe. Keep an eye on Project Lighthouse and Restitched. That's all I have to say."

I played Little Big Planet a bunch when I was growing up. Now I have a four-year-old son who found one of my old sackboy plushies from my childhood. It brought back memories, and I ended up finding this game on PC. I showed my son, and he begged me immediately to play it for him (he's still learning how to game, so he just watches me play some games.) We love this game. It isn't the same that I remember, but the game is still very enjoyable, and my son approves of it. Hopefully, this game unlocks a core memory for him as the originals did for me.

sackboy+a+big+adventure,Recommended,0.2,"Posted: October 27, 2022
If we put aside all the discussions about the new PC features and yet another former Playstation exclusive getting a PC release, and instead get to the point: Sackboy: A Big Adventure is a single player/co-op story-driven platformer. Let's take a brief look at the main aspects of the game.

Neuter:

• Structurally, the game is as simple as it gets: there are 5 worlds, each of which contains roughly 10-15 levels. Core gameplay loop consists of running through various obstacle courses, returning to the hub world where you can change your appearance if you wish and then enter the next level (as a general rule, the levels are connected linearly, with a rare exception when the player gets to choose between 2-3 levels). And that's all there is to it.

• For those who want to master the game and perfect their skills, there's plenty of endgame content after the main story and also a time trials mode called Knitted Knight Trials.

• Seeing how the game is clearly family-oriented (kid-friendly rating, kind and cute humor, etc), the general difficulty should be manageable for the vast majority of the players. Besides, in case you run into difficulties, there's an option to activate an infinite lives mode in the settings, which guarantees that you avoid potential frustration that could've been caused if you lost all of your lives and had to start the level from the beginning again (or choose another level from the hub world if there is one). However, it needs to be said that such an assumption applies only to the main campaign. Knitted Knight Trials and endgame content require advanced mastery.



+ There are tons of mechanics and possibilities that allow you to interact with your co-op partners, decent bosses (or as decent as they can be in a platformer), and the combinations of the aforementioned stuff on many levels, with the gradually increasing level of difficulty. Honestly, it doesn't make a lot of sense to list everything the game has to offer, I just want to state the fact that thanks to this gameplay variety, I can hardly imagine anyone growing bored, unless they disliked the game in the first place.

+ There is a straightforward character customization system in the game. The in-game currency that you collect during gameplay allows you to purchase complete sets/suits, or separate parts of those sets/suits, emojis, Sackboy's colors and fabrics in the local store. This system allows the main character's avatar to stay dripped out throughout the entire game. Fortunately, there are no microtransactions in the game. Therefore, the more you play - the more stuff you'll be able to purchase in the in-game store. The pricing is quite fair - a single playthrough will get you enough currency to purchase a few full sets from each world even if you don't get the highest scores.

+ Absolutely stellar soundtrack. Each level has its own theme song. Sometimes it's something that was made specifically for the game, other times it's a worldwide hit such as ""Take On Me"", and each track synergizes perfectly with everything that is happening on your screen.



- Each level in the game contains special orbs. These orbs are not just achievement-related collectibles and they're not there solely to boost your score and give you bragging rights either. They are, in fact, the keys that unlock the new levels and are essential for story progress. Simply put: let's say you need 10 orbs to unlock the next world, but you've only managed to collect 9 after having beaten the previous one. In this case you'll have to return to one of previous levels and collect the orbs you've missed to get the required number. Since the developers apparently realized how frustrating this mechanic could've potentially ended up being, in my opinion, they set a rather low bar for the amount of orbs required to unlock the next levels, seeing how we never had to replay a single level for that purpose. We did, however, replay a few levels because we enjoyed them that much! With that said, we need to keep in mind that the skill of the players varies dramatically and I can imagine a world where some players would have to GRIND in a platformer for kids. And if that happens - it becomes detrimental to their experience and, as such, becomes a serious downside."

It's a fantastic addition to the PlayStation games being released on PC. I wish they would bring back LittleBigPlanet, but I'm not sure that will ever happen. Still it is a fantastic game, and I would recommend checking it out if you are a fan of LBP."
sackboy+a+big+adventure,Recommended,32.8,"Posted: August 31
Despite being a spin-off of the LittleBigPlanet series, this game shares a lot of the love and sensibilities of the originals. The level design, visuals, character interactions and story is on par for sure.

I will say that if you play alone or rush through to the end, you won't get to experience a decent portion of the game since a lot of it isn't required to get to the end. If you go for 100% you'll certainly get your money's worth."

I will change this review to positive when devs removes epic installer and data collection from the game.

this game installs some epic store programs on your computer.
this game collects data from your computer

I dont see why a steam game needs to install epic store programs on my pc to run a steam version of the game.
I keept interupting the installer but epic garbage still somehow have mannaged to install itself.

And when I launched the game I saw sevreral epic store tasks starting up in the background, and no matter how much I tryed to stop these tasks, they keept starting back up again.

I whent into add/remove programs and uninstalled EVERYTHING epicstore related garbage this game installed.
this might have worked but I have my doubts.

When I started the game after this epic garbage, I was greeted by a question asking to allow data collection.... you have two choises, fully allow, or limited...
what about decline? players should be allowed to decline any data sendt.
I never said yes or limited, I let it run there long enough to post the review.

as long as epic being forced on me and they want my data, I dont recomend this game."

This game is fantastic. Sackboy helped my wife and I through one of the hardest times in our lives. Our son was born premature at 26 weeks weighing 1lb 7 ounces. It was a long four months driving back and forth to work and the hospital. During this time, I suggested we play something to take our mind off of our circumstances if only for an hour or so. She reluctantly agreed and I picked out sackboy. At the time, I had a PS5 which I sold later to cover some medical bills. We loved the entire experience. The music levels are brilliant and I couldn't help but smile everytime we jumped into craft world. It can be a tougher game, but its really worth it. My wife played and she had no real gaming experience so i don't mind recommending it to gamers of any level! The graphics are gorgeous, the music is sublime, and it's endlessly fun. I'm playing it now on my steamdeck while my son is asleep at night. I bought it on sale, but I would have paid full price both times for it considering my nostalgia with it. I hope you enjoy from my family to yours.

I grew up playing LittleBigPlanet on my PS3 and eventually PS4. I'll take any game with sackboy in and the amount of nostalgia i got playing this for littlebigplanet was amazing. I had fun doing the levels and just seeing the level design. Although im very easily pleased tho. Praying for a real LBP Port one day!!!"

Played this on PS5, and it's just as fun here. Ray-tracing makes it look better than ever, and the high fps support helps the action feel more responsive and smoother. It's fun solo, and in co-op, it reminds me of Super Mario 3D World. Also, it comes will all of the costumes that have released as free DLC, so you have some nice variety for customization from the beginning.

PC controls also work well, but using a controller is the way to go."

First of all, keep 'em coming Sony.

I've never played LBP, but based on the trailers and bit of gameplay I've seen, LBP was a lot darker and edgy, which is not exactly my thing, however Sackboy it's more wholesome and in my opinion, It's the definition of an E rated game, which is not bad at all. Not only can you play it with your little sibling or children but you'll have lots of fun. And while not required to advance, it can become challenging to try and 100% the whole thing.

The game looks amazing graphically speaking and the whole world and characters have this style that look like handmade, beautiful. It still needs a bit of optimization though, and for some reason having a PS5 controller wired to the PC for it's features tanked my fps. Otherwise controls are pretty good and intuitive, it definitely seems like a Sackboy themed Super Mario World, and since Nintendo won't release those on PC I think it's the closest you can get.

As with other Playstation titles, the challenges or trials in this case, were the most tedious part of the game, but definitely worth trying to complete. Other than that there was only one level near the ending that really gave me a bad time, but with practice the gold rank is doable.

In conclusion, pretty decent platformer, good graphics and style, in need of a bit of optimization, co-op must play, get it on sale."

Update 2022/09/11 - Shader Stuttering seems to be fixed - Time to enjoy this beautiful game
With today's update, the shader problems seem to be fixed. I deleted my savegames to restart the game and so far all is smooth in 60 FPS with maxed settings and ray tracing in 2K resolution.

The camera stuttering with mismatching FPS game/monitor hertz settings is still there. Work-around is still working: simply set FPS and monitor refresh rate to the same number your system is able to provide at a stable rate. My CPU is too old to get a stable 120hz without lowering DLSS to performance, but I get stable 60 FPS with DLSS quality mode.

The game looks fantastic on PC and thanks to the smooth performance now, it's as enjoyable as the PS5 version. WIth the vast range of graphic settings and the fixed stuttering, it should run well on mid range PCs. I change my recommendation.

---------------------------------------
Original review of 2022/09/02
Sackboy is a very beautiful PC port, the ray tracing additions let it stand out compared to the PS5 version, but so does the shader stuttering... which shatters the whole experience.

From the start on, you will be facing stuttering with this title, especially strong when you come into a new cutscene or a new level with lotsa new elements. Everytime some new element (enemy, item, effects) shows up for the first time, you will face micro stutter, no matter how powerful your system might be.

Replaying a level only solves the problem temporarily, as soon as you update your graphic card driver, the stutter will start all over again. This could easily be solved if the game would take a few minutes and compile all shaders on the first game start (and whenever you update drivers).

As DF pointed out there's an additional problem: camera stutter on flexible FPS. Work-around: set the FPS limiter and refresh-rate of your monitor to the same number your system is able to deliver at a stable rate, e.g. 60FPS/60Hz, 120FPS/120Hz etc.

While I appreciate the graphical update, negligences like this in a big budget title aren't acceptable. On the other hand, former PS ports were very solid or quickly fixed.

Meanwhile I recommend Uncharted instead, as God of War an awesome PS port. Uncharted builds the shaders in the background and shows the percentage. So you can either wait for it to complete or if it doesn't affect the performance of your current level let it do its stuff while enjoying a silky smooth game.

I hope Sackboy sees a similar solution in the near future."

Love sony exclusives on PC. Keep porting them and I will keep buying them. There are some people talking of shader compilation stutter but that only happens when you have RTX enabled. The game has super intense RTX settings which took my framerate from 300+ to 70 on 3090ti and it didn't look all that much better. Recommend just turning off RTX and the stutter is gone."

Review by Gaming Masterpieces - The greatest games of all time on Steam.

Is this game a masterpiece? YES, absolutely. 3D platformers don't get much better than this. This game is (after Gods of War, Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves and Ratchet & Clank) another PlayStation-exclusive hit ported to the PC. You can now also experience the adventures of the likeable hero from sackcloth on Steam. The game has been on the PlayStation market for almost 2 years. Who is Sackboy, anyway? Some may never have heard the name. Well, Sackboy is the knitted hero from the Little Big Planet games. For the launch of Sony's PlayStation 5, he finally got his first standalone adventure of his own. Unlike the Little Big Planet games, however, where players could create their own games and share them with the community, Sackboy: A Big Adventure is a pure 3D platformer with a focus on action and with a fun multiplayer mode. However, a level editor is no longer included.

A platform game lives and dies with its controls. The design goal of it was therefore a control system that is really simple and accessible, but also has a certain depth. Therefore, Sackboy's repertoire of movements has been greatly expanded compared to the previous games. He can jump, of course, he can run, and grabbing and pulling things is a really important part of the game. But then a bunch of other moves have been added. For example, a rolling movement for dodging, a graphically totally cute hover mode, the possibility of a smash jump.... Sackboy now also has movement options that can be found in other 3D games. In addition, there is his fist punch, which can now be triggered simply by pressing the X button, and with which smaller opponents can already be eliminated with one hit. In combination with these movement possibilities, quite complex sequences are now possible, which are simply necessary for a challenging and exciting platformer. A loss of life resets you at the last (of the numerous) save points within a level, but if you lose all lives, it's back to the world map.

What is the story actually about? Well, the story is not a masterpiece, but leans very much on the usual hero story of computer games. Especially in platformers, I've seen it more than once... Bad guy shows up, kidnaps all my friends, only I can still save my friends (and the whole world). It wasn't just in the fantastic Sonic Generations that it was like that. But why invent something new when the old stories work well? In this case, it's the insidious Vex who suddenly flies in and sucks up all the villagers with his hoover, only Sackboy can escape quickly with a small rocket. Vex is now forcing our friends to build a very strange and evil device that will turn the whole world into a parched, barren eyesore full of nightmares. Of course, we have to stop that!

Our adventure to stop the nasty Vex takes us through completely different worlds. From snowy mountains, a tropical jungle, an underwater world or even a detour into outer space, everything is there. The view is isometric - we see our hero from behind or from the side, whereby, interestingly, the angle of view is fixed. In contrast to most comparable 3D platformers, we cannot move the view with the right stick - instead, we always see Sackboy from a little further away from a predefined viewing angle. It is therefore no longer so easy for inexperienced players to lose track. However, our hero can be seen a little smaller on the screen due to the slightly more distant camera, which makes precision jumps more difficult to perform. In general, however, you get used to this way of displaying the game very quickly and control Sackboy like a pro through the increasingly complex sections of the game. In addition, it is practically impossible to get sick because of the 3D graphics. Each section is filled to the brim with collectibles and hidden challenges outside the direct path to the end of the level. Even on the overview maps there are many hidden areas to find.

The game does not include a level editor. However, you can still exercise your creativity in creating new things - by customising your character to your liking. In the shop of Zom Zom we can exchange the collectibles (bells) we collect during the game for new outfits (and hats, emotes or faces). You can also change the colour of your hero and save your creations of outfit, hat, face, emotes and colour. The selection of items already unlocked for Sackboy from the beginning is large. Very extensive. Some additional skins can also be discovered and unlocked directly in the game itself. Finally, you can download two additional free DLCs on Steam with which you can transform Sackboy into Nathan Drake or Chloe Frazer from Uncharted.

A special feature is the online multiplayer mode. You can take on Sackboy's adventures with up to four players. This is basically a cooperative multiplayer mode, but you can also annoy each other. Picking up the other player and throwing them around may be useful in many situations, but can also be quite tedious if it happens for no apparent reason. All levels can be played together, and in addition to the main missions, there are some multiplayer-only levels where cooperative action is necessary to get to the end.

Aren't consoles actually the species-appropriate habitat for classic 3D platformers? Super Mario 64 (for the Nintendo 64) is still considered the first really good game of its kind, and for a long time there were hardly any comparable good things on the PC. But those days are probably over now. With megahits like A Hat in Time, Psychonauts 2 and the recently released Kao the Kangaroo, there are also first-class genre representatives for the PC. Kao the Kangoroo in particular reminded me of the good old days with the Nintendo 64. Many of the classics originally released on consoles have also made it to the PC, and here (since they were released much later than the original) they are technically by far the best versions. Just a small selection of the stuff worth recommending: Crash Bandicoot n Sane Trilogy with the first three games of the originally PlayStation exclusive story of Naughty Dog's lovable bandicoot, the Spyro Reignited Trilogy with the first three parts of the adventures of the young dragon Spyro, or the not so childish adventures of Sponge Boob in SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom - Rehydrated. Finally, in July, Hell Pie, a new game by a slightly unsavoury little devil, came onto the market, which doesn't have to hide from the long-established brands either.

The graphics of Sackboy don't look that exciting at first glance. Maybe that's because I didn't find the predecessor Little Big Planet particularly good-looking either - but that was my personal taste. At second glance, however, I have to say that Sackboy: A Big Adventure is also an absolutely top game in terms of graphics. The levels are extremely varied, there are countless animations, enemy types and always new surprises to find. The graphics are colourful, high-resolution and technically the developer has made full use of the capabilities of modern PCs (or graphics cards). You can play the game in a razor-sharp 4K (3840 × 2160) resolution on your new TV, you can play it on your ultrawide gaming monitor with 3440x1440 (21:9), you play with 60 FPS if you have the appropriate hardware, newer Nvidia graphics cards offer Super Sampling (DLSS) and a correspondingly high screen refresh rate far beyond 60 Hz is also no problem. Gamepad works of course fine, you can even use the special features of the official wireless PlayStation 5 controller... if you connect it to your PC via cable.


Sackboy is good, really good. One of the best 3D platformers currently available on the PC."

Do not buy this unless fixed.

Sumo Digital did not bother to incorporate any form of shader pre-caching so this game builds shaders on the fly and litearlly s h i t s itself with stuttering left and right, virtually unacceptable especially given the asking price. Don't believe me? Watch the Digital Foundry video.

On top of this they force the cancer that is Epic Online Services to install on your computer without permission the moment you launch the game. Evidently this is nothing more than a sloppy rush job of a port, certainly not worth the asking price in it's current state."

For the campaign, it feels like Super Mario Odyssey... Just not quite as good.
As a LittleBigPlanet game, it is terrible. If that was what you wanted, you're not going to be happy.
A game who's community's favorite thing was the community levels.. And they removed the community levels.

I don't know about you, but I don't care if the game is 2d or 3d if it's fun.

I'm now 25 years old, I played LBP1, 2, and 3. Once you beat the campaign you come back to multiplayer and the community. What does this game have after you beat the story? Nothing.
What's the point of a really cool wardrobe if you have no one to share it with? Replay the same levels over and over for no reason? Why?
PC doesn't even have anyone playing online because there's nothing to do once you've beaten the game.

In summary: If you wanted a LBP game, don't get this one. If you want your kid to play something like mario Odyssey but you don't want to buy a switch, get this one.
If you simply want a pretty good story to sit through gameplay to see, go for it, it's not a bad game. It's just probably not what you're expecting."

It's the closest thing we've got to LittleBigPlanet on PC at this moment, though not your traditional LBP game. It's a silly little platformer, and makes for a great romp with friends. I made myself feel a little bit better buying this maybe convincing someone at Sony that LBP is worth porting to PC. Yes, I am high as ♥♥♥♥ on copium, I know :( Regardless, the game is good fun and most of my time playing it has been offline on trips.

It was awesome playing this on my Deck, not sure why I saw a review claiming issues with the Epic Games store when I didn't experience that at all. Even if it was an issue, I imagine using Lutris might help."

This is the greatest game my 4 year old daughter and I have ever played. I would bet almost anyone would love it.
Graphics - amazing. Gameplay - intuitive and excellent. Levels - very fun, diverse, challenging, creative. This story is cute and fun. We played as one player for several levels/worlds then one day I bought a second controller, and we had even more fun playing 2 player from then on. The game even changes for 2 players, requiring different strategies and players have to help each other through the levels. There are tons of levels to work through in each world, and 5 different ""worlds"". We've got over 110 hours and have almost finished beating ""Vex"" the villian of the story. My daughter and I had so much fun playing this game. Every morning she asks if we can ""go downstairs and play Sackboy"". Previously we've played Yooka-Laylee, Super Lucky, Slime Rancher, Sonic, and Sackboy is by far the best most enjoyable game we've ever played. I hope to find more games like this in the future."

So what's it about?
It's Sack Boy!!! And you can play it on PC how cool is that :-). It's best described as a 3D platforming game similar like Mario Odyssey. You are the unlikely hero to save the world from the Baddies. This world is so full of textures, materials and little details that you just want to step inside your PC and touch it.

The good
The graphics, the sounds effects and the music is some of the best you can find at the moment on PC. It looks so good and plays so well. I used a controller and I had a great experience (TBH I cannot see how you would be able to play it without controller but it’s there if you like 😊).

There is so much customisation - emotes, costumes and then you can mix it all up. There are so many cool details to discover; a lot of love went into the game. You can even dress up like a silly chromium LED banana with New Years glasses: what more do you want?

I love the challenge the trial levels offers and some of the later levels .

There is local coop and it works remarkably well but... (see below)

... some levels require two players to complete - you can finish the first one by one player but it's awkward. The latter levels are much more demanding and you really need another player. With online multiplayer being what it is - it would have been great to have an AI to assist you or just not to make the coop levels a requirement for completion.

It has the Epic Games overlay. Why? I bought the game on Steam not on Epic :-(. An optional sign-up/in to Sony PlayStation is asked - as a reward you will get an additional costume. At first I thought signing in to PSN would allow cross play but that is not the case. Likely because the game signs in to three different networks the first 10 seconds at the title screen is experience stuttering. It doesn't affect the main game at all but it remains annoying.

There is no online cross play - I looked for Steam (Epic?) players several times but unfortunately no one was there. If you would like to complete the many multiplayer achievements then this will be a challenge unless you can find someone to partner up locally.

Unfortunately, there is no HDR support - while the game looks great it would look even better with HDR. The closest is perhaps using Win11 AutoHDR function.

I had two hard crashes (blue screen) while the game being paused. I’m not sure what happened there. Other than that, I didn't experience any issues, bugs or glitches.

It would be great if the game had a level editor like Mario Maker and that you could share levels with the online community.

There is a huge difficulty spike between the end of world 4 and world 5 . If you plan to ace all of these levels, be prepared to restart a lot until you get it exactly right. Sometimes it is just skill and other times pure luck - there are some levels where the margin of error is like 0.1 second or less. You make a mistake just before the end? You will have to restart. This is less of an issue if you just want to complete the story and I suppose there is some reward when you finally get it right.

I always wanted to play Sack Boy but I never had the opportunity to get a PlayStation. I absolutely loved the game and I can highly recommend it if you like cute (3D) platforming games. The game is not challenging at first but offers instead a chill experience with great music, visual and so much customisation to Sack Boy. This changes for the last third of the game where it becomes challenging to impossible – but most players will not see this part I assume while looking at the achievement. It is a work of art - and probably the best 3D platform experience on par with Mario Odyssey. It offers easy local COOP. What I didn’t like are the many networks the game needs to sign in and the lack of cross play."

[Months Later Edit: I can't say enough good things about this game. the GAME is almost front-to-back amazing. if you're into 3D Mario games, if you're into platformers this is just about as great as it gets. I don't want to seem ungrateful for the actual quality of the title. my original review is one of disgust and disdain, and I wish I hadn't felt that way . . . but I was absolutely furious about the filthy surprise of my NEEDING to install and integrate with the Epic Game Store, a platform that for some reason makes me feel unclean just being there. I resent the need for a bad app on my system, I DOUBLY resent it not being advertised or forewarned. but with the game I had and have a BLAST. not fair to wreck a game's community rating when the game itself is SO good . . . but the amount of sleaze brought it out of me. be well, everyone. we're getting there. peace peace. Original Review follows. -b23]
- - -

This is a really terrific platformer. It's creative, it's challenging, it's tightly designed and the gameplay can reach Mario-like heights of tightness of control and movement. I really do think it's got some PEAK PLATFORMING, period. I recall some of those later stages got really intense, too (I've got a bunch of hours on the PS4 version; I like this game enough to buy it TWICE. So that says alot for me, as it should for anyone, really. It's a good, sometimes even GREAT 3D platformer with gorgeous visuals and some top ideas. I recommend the game, for what it is, unreservedly, but do be mindful it's VERY childish and bright. This is annoying-level whimsical, but for the genre, what do you want? It's aimed at kids, clearly.)

However, I booted up this anticipated PC port, on STEAM, as you can see, and all of a sudden the EPIC STORE was forced to crawl out of its slumber (I have it for Tony Hawk and as of review *only* Tony Hawk) and started to update.

but wait, I bought this on STEAM, though. I bought this game *specifically on STEAM*, and in fact I bought this NOT on the EPIC STORE, on PURPOSE. because the EPIC STORE is almost constantly a *rankly* horrible experience to deal with, only lagging behind probably UBISOFT'S ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ store on the bottom list of ""Worst Unnecessary, Redundant Online Store Apps"".

their business practices and ethics (or lack OF ethics) is pretty famous at this point. I don't want to deal with that ♥♥♥♥ unless absolutely necessary, like with ""Tony Hawk's 1 + 2"", which is an absolute masterpiece but *only* available through that ♥♥♥♥♥ store. maybe one day ""Sifu"", too.

so no, I won't RECOMMEND this great game because of that and ONLY because of that. I didn't know I was buying this for TWO storefronts, thanks SO MUCH for not making that at all clear or convenient or fair. why would I buy it on STEAM to only have it boot up a second horrible, HORRIBLE store so that TOO can unnecessarily eat up memory? EPIC STORE? are you kidding me?

---- that. what a waste. I learn it was even added LATER, so the poor sucks that bought it early absolutely got snowed. nice.

how embarrassing. great game. not recommended. never. if this is the way you intend to do business, fine. you sure fooled me. congratulations. you also got my money, even though it was on sale. congratulations.

but you ain't getting a damn recommended review. not after that, not from me. if that's the way it is, not ever. it's not fair to the quality title? I agree. I agree.

it's not fair at all, actually.

and yet here we are. I feel unclean."

It is really hard to talk about this game, LBP is a classic ip that lends itself well to the style of Mario 3d world platformers but the issue with this game is it has real issues, there are many design choices that make the game fall short of great plus there are some bugs and glitches that straight up ruin the enjoyment.
The biggest issue with the game in my opinion is the level designs for the game, there are so many levels that end up being extremely frustrating because of either buggy elements of the game or simple design choices.
One of these choices are the camera, this game uses fixed cameras which really creates issues, many parts of levels and even entirety of some levels are reduced to player bashing their head against the wall because the camera is giving the player a skewed view of the world which leads to poor jumps or movements.
There are some fun levels that are set to some familiar pop and rock (1 rock song as far as I remember) tunes that you get to play through, but most other levels are running the OST and unfortunately the game's OST has more misses than hits which is a shame when you think of how good the OST for LBP games was.
Sound design has some glitches but they can go over normally with a level restart.
The story is basically Mario storyline, you have the not bowser kidnap your friends and you set out to save them and stop the big bad.
The visual presentation of the game is beyond gorgeous, Sumo has really made the presentation feel close to lbp 1 and 2's feel.
All in all for the first outing in this genre it is not horrible but it is a flawed game, and while it doesn't seem MM has any interest in picking up LBP ip again I can hope Sumo continues working with this ip and we get many more lbp related titles.

One of the best platformers of the past 2 generations and severely underrated. Consider it a sibling to Super Mario 3D World in design. Like 3D Land the game gets surprisingly challenging as you approach the final worlds in a way you wouldn't expect from the cutsey visuals.

Now that the shader complication issues are fixed it runs incredibly well and if you have an rtx card the raytracing is transformative. Game looks so much better on high end pcs compared to PS5.

The game is a beautiful mess in 4 player online coop too if you want to throw some buddies or randos to their doom. A must for 3d platformer fans and I hope it eventually finds success on pc!"

The purpose of the Complete Edition is to allow for RCT3 to be sold on Steam again under a new name and publisher after Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 Platinum was taken down by Atari a few years ago. This version is not a ""remaster"".

This means that if you have previously purchased RCT3 Platinum before it was removed from the Steam Store, you DO NOT need to buy this version of the game. The only major differences between Platinum and the Complete Edition are that references to Atari are removed and the game supports 1920x1080 resolution by default, other than that it is the exact same game as before.

However, if you are like me and did not get the chance to buy RCT3 Platinum on Steam previously, then this re-release is for you!

This game was one of the many games of my childhood and I am glad I can play it again after losing the original disks."

This is technically the same game as Platinum!, except for the fact that it has support for HD resolutions and no Atari branding anywhere. If you don't have RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 Platinum!, then I would get this.

I see a lot of people complaining that it is essentially a copy of what we had before and it seems like a cash grab. However, Frontier now has the rights to the game again, which opens the possibility for updates in the future to enhance the game and fix bugs, upgrade it to modern tech (64-bit, multicore support).

Now, it has yet to be seen if that will happen, so if you already own the Platinum edition that was for sale previously, I would hold on and see if any updates to come to life."

Don't be fooled by the ""5 hours of playtime"". I've been playing RCT3 since it first came out, and after several re-purchases, from disc to digital, I can conclude that this old game is still gold!
It may not be as pretty as Planet Coaster, but it simply has more content. You can't make Water Parks, Zoos, or custom fireworks shows in PlanCo.

If you prefer more realistic graphics and physics, by all means buy Planet Coaster.
RCT3 simply has better gameplay."

Great game, very fun, however I was hoping they would add something new to it when releasing it in 2020; the original game came out in 2005. There is also the bug that the side friction coaster displays a very inaccurate description. I would like to say that this game is likely not for everybody. I feel like a large part of it is nostalgia (even though I first got it in 2014) and I don't know how it compares to more modern games like coaster planet. I do wish there was multi-player options, but as far as I know it is just a solo game. Overall great game, made me forget how lonely I am, 9/10."

The Roller Coaster Tycoon franchise has been a bit like a roller coaster itself. RCT1 was the chain lift, bringing everyone up to the top of the world, while RCT2 was more like that first plunging drop, the one you go down screaming the whole way with excitement. Both were great games, both are games that are hard to top.

RCT3 can't quite beat them. RCT3, to use the coaster analogy above, is like the loop right after the big drop. It's exciting, it's a bit scary, it makes you want to try it again, and you remember that part of the roller coaster for years afterward. But without the chain lift and without the first drop, you have no momentum to make a loop like that. RCT3 is built upon the great ideas of the first games, but in the conversion to 3D, some small amounts of the charm have been lost.

Don't let the few hours I've played fool you: I bought this on Steam for the expansion packs, because my ancient retail CD was just the base game, and I played thousands of hours of RCT3 before losing the disc.

So, what is the good, the bad, and the ugly of RCT3?

The Good:
-As the game is older, the price is great.
-It doesn't matter if your computer only has integrated graphics, it'll run RCT3 quite well.
-Riding the Rides is a good novelty.
-This comes with the Soaked and Wild expansion packs, which allow you to build pools and animal enclosures respectively, along with packing in a bunch of new rides.
-Has a great sandbox mode where money is not a problem, letting you build crazy cool parks.
-Has great scenarios that can be a challenge.
-100% kid friendly.
-Has a scenario builder so you can create your own challenges. Great for when you want Sandbox with Money Management, for example, or when you want to give yourself a real challenge.

The Bad:
-Riding the Rides is a novelty, and that novelty wears off quite quickly.
-While it'll run on everything, there's a reason for that, and that reason is the graphics are dated. For people like me, who don't care about graphics so long as the game is fun, this won't be a problem, but if you're someone who needs photo-realistic textures and ray-tracing to enjoy their game, this is not for you.
-Expect to look a lot of things up because this comes from an era where tutorials were optional and didn't always include everything you should know. Luckily, the game is old, so a ton of information is out there.
-While the game will tell you that your guests are hungry/thirsty/looking for a toilet, it won't tell you exactly where the problem is. This can lead to frustration if you've spent hours making the Junk Food Market in the middle of your park, but guests that won't quit riding Awesome Coaster 1 are getting hungry in the far corner of the park and complaining about it.

The Ugly:
-Terrain editing is a bit unintuitive. This sounds like a minor thing until you realize that a sandbox park is just a flat surface to build on. If you're wanting to theme an area, or even just cheese the support height limits for a roller coaster, expect frustration.
-Some of the scenarios will make you scream in frustration.
-Peeps (the people riding your roller coasters and flat rides) are stupid sometimes. This stupidity also extends to your park employees. If you notice dozens of rides breaking down, animal enclosures not being fixed, pools getting filthy, paths covered in puke and litter, or any other signs that your employees aren't doing what they need to do, have a look in the Staff Management window for glitched out janitors and mechanics. Pick them up and drop them on a path.
-Some micromanagement will be required. If you hate this, it's going to ruin your day. Rides will break down, Peeps barf all over your park, litter stacks up, and the bigger your park is, the more you're going to have to use the Patrol Area tool to assign your mechanics and janitors to areas of the park. Animals will, given proper food and space, breed more animals. Keep an eye on this or you'll soon find an enclosure that was perfect for the couple of lions you had is now packed too full with lions that aren't happy.

If you're used to how tycoon games typically work (Lots of micromanagement, building things here and there, and spending a few hours now and then trying to figure out why what you did won't work), RCT3 is a good choice for you. If you want a great roller coaster building game that you can run on just about anything, RCT3 is a decent choice. If you've wanted to build an awesome theme park, you'll probably enjoy RCT3. If you played RCT3 a few years ago and can't find your old discs anymore, this will give you a good nostalgia hit and leave you smiling for a few hours. If, however, you're looking for the glory days of RCT2, you'll have to get that game instead.

Also, if you need to scrub the rotten taste out of your mouth after playing any of the later RCT titles (anything released after RCT3), this works great.

Oh, and a word to the wise: if you get motion sick easily, don't ride the rides in this game. Some of the coasters you might build could very well recreate the Peep experience at home, and the janitors in game make cleaning up vomit look way easier than it actually is. Also, while this game doesn't support VR, I'd also recommend against trying to make it work with VR. The camera controls by themselves might make you motion sick, and riding any of the coasters is a one way ticket to worshipping the porcelain throne."

For people who havethe ""Mouse stuttering"" issue: Turn your mouse polling rate down. I had to set mine to 120hz to run the game with no stuttering. It's a common issue in a few DX9 titles, used to happen a lot to me in smite but they've since fixed it (i think?) and i can run 1000hz no problem in smite. But of course since THIS game it's an issue that most likely won't be fixed you need to turn your polling rate down! Hope that helps

No big groundbreaking changes for this remaster of the Platinum Edition, but what you do get is a far smoother gaming experience. Earlier this year I rediscovered the Platinum Edition, originally built and released during the Windows 7 era. Running Windows 10, I found that RCT3 Platinum had a tendency to suffer extreme lag as parks got bigger, and this Steam release all but eliminates that problem. Your mileage may vary depending on what you're running, but for my experience as a fan since the earliest RCT1 release, it's a welcome opportunity to return to a longtime favorite."

This is a classic game. It never gets boring because you can create so many types of theme parks and rides. In some ways I like it even more than Planet Coaster. Sure the graphics are a little cruder, but being able to build a theme park including a water park and a zoo makes this game a little superior to me. I think if you are not a master builder and cannot be bothered to spend 2 hours to build a single station building then this is the game for you!"

RCT 3 is one of the best time wasting strategy game out there and with the Complete Edition,which has Soaked and Wild expansions,you can easily waste hours and hours managing some of the best amusement parks that we all wish we had near our cities.

Graphically,it's pretty decent,at least now,back when it released it was pretty dope,having reflective water and some of the light effects were a blast to checkout and manage,especially the fireworks which you can create and edit however you want.

Audio wise it's ok,there is nothing amazing about it,tho the soundtrack is quite chill and relaxing,depending on which of the in-game songs you choose and you can also import your own songs or music and have it play in-game which is pretty nice.

Now the gameplay,that's where it really shines. The game lets you freely create and design most of the coasters,transport rides but also pools,wildlife zoo's and pretty much create a waterpark filled with sketchy and insane rides.

You can edit fee's,taxes,manage employees that clean or repair rides,shops can sell their default items or you can mix them up in some custom shops that are brilliant to easily get money and never go bankrupt.

Most rides also feature custom blueprints you can either download online and then just put them into your park or just save yours and upload those,really boosting creative rides and experiences,which also,you can enjoy because the game lets you use a cinematic camera that will follow the ride and you can pretty much experience what horrific or absolutely insane ride you created.

There isn't really any story,you can just enjoy the campaign that each of the expansions and the main game has or just play a custom sandbox where you really can go wild with your imagination.

Sadly,the game has quite a few bugs,some are just visual bugs,others sometimes can crash the game,so do save a bit regularly cause you never know what might break the game,I had a scenario where I tested a launch ride with over 400 km/h and when the ride flew out in space the game just froze and crashed.

Overall tho,Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 is still one of the best park management games out there and now that it's on Steam,it's definitely worth a try,a solid strategy game that might never get too old.

Dude. Nostalgia waves for hours! I remember being so very excited for a Windows XP and this game. I would ask for expansion packs on my birthdays, and my brother and I would play and dream about theme parks throughout most of our childhood. This game was an inspiration and a great joy to play for many years, and I am glad to see it in its complete form again with the upgraded aspect ratios. I have never been able to play it so fluidly and have it load so quickly! Yes, it may be from an older era of graphics, and people have been saying that their water glitches really badly....which it did. I decided to just downgrade the water quality in my settings and now I don't have any problems. Who really needs water to reflect everything perfectly? And who needs to see the bottom of a lake? Do you see every inch of a lake bed in reality? Nope. I would recommend those who grew up with this classic to pick it up, but it may me underwhelming to any new players who never enjoyed it in their childhood. The grid building style and management aspects are enjoyable to me, but it isn't for everyone. I'm sold."

This is simply a re-hash of RollerCoaster Tycoon 3: Platinum that was rereleased for PC on Steam.

Remember when RCT3 was removed by Atari?

Anyway, this version definitely plays better than the original release. Bugs are far less common, the game runs smoother and has a more stable framerate, and is generally better optimized.

There are a couple of cons: terrain editing can still be aggravating, so be meticulous when you do it--the game will screw up paths at the slightest movement during terrain manipulation, and it can be an nightmare to fix.

Also, it may just be me, but the Janitors seem to be less effective? Had to hire a lot more, and actually make use of patrol areas.

BIGGEST PRO: This version supports custom content exactly as the old versions did, so if you have custom scenery, CTRs/CFRs, and the like, they will be perfectly playable here. Just make sure you reinstall them right!

Honestly though, I'm biased towards this game. I've gotten well over thousands of hours into the disc retail release of this game, and it's in my top 15 favorite games of all time. So you'll get glowing praise from me.

I recommend this game to anyone with a creative mind. Sure, Planet Coaster exists, but this game is a LOT less demanding and has a MASSIVE modding scene. Definitely the most worthy compromise you can get."

I can still see myself 20 years ago, making complicated roller coasters that eventually caused chaos each time or water slides that were infinitely long. Good times.

Rollercoaster Tycoon 3: Complete edition comes with the extra-large expansions, which is very useful as there is a mode with infinite resources, so many items, attractions, and so much more that you can spend your infinite resources on.
Just to mention 1 example, there are more than 60 stores!
There are plenty of items available to turn your theme park into a nature park, or a wildlife park, or a super-sized water park, the choice is in your hands so it's up to you to show your creativity through Rollercoaster Tycoon.

Don't forget that you can use the 'coaster cam' for each attraction, this allows you to experience each attraction via a first person camera, which provides very cool visuals, this would also be great in VR.

In short, the game has the relaxing way of building with a nice overview where everything is quickly via click-reach.

This is pure and simple the Platinum! edition but now somehow with more game breaking issues.
If you already own a copy of RCT3 somewhere else you then play that version as this still doesnt support anything higher than 1080p and still has the infamous framerate mouse stuttering issue from the Atari Port.

My name is Leah, I have had 3 copies of this game in total and I have never regretted it.

This review will highlight the cons and pros of RCT3 (Roller Coaster Tycoon 3), if you do not like reading long reviews I recommend passing on my review. That being said I will give my honest personal opinion and history with this game, my first copy was in 2012, the original physical copy which I at the time played on my Dell laptop. The graphics for a game made in 2011 were astounding, more so the gameplay and money managing aspects of this game really nailed it. Not only does this game teach young kids money management but it also teaches it in a manageable bite-sized portions, you screw with the loans and you go bankrupt, you get greedy with that new coaster and you go bankrupt. To mention the varieties of coasters is just breath-taking, from the Air-Powered Coasters to the Wooden Coasters and everything in between you have every type you'll need.

The coaster customisation is amazing to say the bare minimum. You have the options to color your tracks in 3 ways. (Top Icon is the rails, Left is the sides and Right is the supports.) Alongside being able to make the actual coaster multicolor you can do the same for your cars. It's all there from music to lift chain speed. By default the music will be excessively loud but it's quite easy to configure in comparison to other games.

Anyway here are the pros of the game;
- Great Customisation
- Astounding Variety of coasters, food and drink.
- Decent graphics
- Teaches money management
- Doesn't cost as much as a triple A game of the same quality
- Includes all the DLC packs.
- Sandbox mode + Campaign mode
- Can see the coaster in FP
- Very goofy at times (making 350,000KPH coasters, No finish Coasters, 10-20G coasters)

cons of RCT3: Complete Edition;
- Outdated soundtracks
- Glitchy when expanding to x4 the average park
- Campaign takes time to progress
- Campaign is too easy
- The last good iteration of RCT

Hope this was helpful!

This is exactly the kind of nostalgia I was looking for when I saw this game was on Steam. If you're looking to pick RCT3 back up then I wouldn't be put off by the negative reviews, but do note the following:
- While the resolution now goes up to 1080p, the UI doesn't scale
- There is a bit of stuttering, mostly when your parks get a bit bigger, though this was always an issue for me back in the day and it's not too noticeable
- I would buy it on sale, for me nostalgia is only worth so much - I picked it up for a fiver in the Lunar New Year sale!

I really, really wanted this to work. I've more than recouped my nostalgia pool on the original two RCT games, what with the fantastic OpenRCT2 mod out there, and was really looking forward to playing through this game again, on a modern system.

Everything goes well in this until you try to operate the camera... an essential function, no doubt. Soon as you do, the frame stutter kicks in and the game becomes relatively unplayable, at least by the standards I had set for it.

This current iteration is non functional as-is on the steam store. It also bearing a 2020 copyright in the title screen means someone's updated it recently; so until they push a fix for the issue, don't let them peddle a broken game."

RCT3: Complete Edition isn't a bad game, its just that people kinda expected more from a ""remaster"" with a $20 price tag. Am I disappointed? Slightly. But IMO this re-release is aimed at the people who:

A) Cannot afford Planet coaster
B) Have nostalgia for the first game
or C) Don't already have RCT3 but want it

So if you're going in expecting massive graphics upgrades, you'll be disappointed.

But if you just want to experience RCT3 again after 14 years, or if you want a 3d theme park game but can't afford PlanCo and its expansions, I think you'll love this

EDIT: Changed remaster to re-release, because its purpose isn't really a remaster, more of a re-release."

RollerCoaster Tycoon® 3: Complete Edition

In summary, this was a kind of game that you would have in your childhood, which is a good one. Rollercoaster Tycoon 3 was the first edition of the Rollercoaster Tycoon series that featured an actual 3D gameplay, rather than 2D like Rollercoaster Tycoon 1 and 2, which have been quite successful in the past, which still is in newer reboots for modern systems and Mobile, which I would highly recommend on the go. We don't talk about RCT World, ew

- The Graphics are dated indeed, however, it still holds the memories.
- You can ride all your Rides and Rollercoasters for the first time!
- A very rememberable soundtrack, many variety.
- Multiple themes to Typical Parks to Spooky ones.
- Expansion packs that were legit and not a cash grab, To Zoo's and Waterparks included.
- Firework Mixer
- The 'James Hunt' cheat to spawn a Jeep to drive and run over people.
- Death Wooden and Speed Coasters to demolish guest for fun.
- The Park Inspector that you would torture or put in a animal enclosure.
- Last but not least, the last successful and rememberable game of the Rollercoaster Tycoon Franchise.

Now with the Complete Edition compared to the Platinum Edition, there was a licensing disagreement which caused this to be re-released. Now, I expected this as a remaster, it's not, it's a re-release with 1080p support, which I certainly am happy to use this on my 1080p laptop. However, I do have a issue that no higher resolutions are a option to pick from, why? I hope there's a chance of a update or a configuring to enable 1440p or even 4k, you take the time to add 1080p why stop there?

It's still nice though, the game can be bought again. Now for a price point of $20 if you had the Platinum, this is a good buy or pass honestly, it's more directed to 1080p resolutions with little to no changes. Though, if you never had the Platinum, yes, this is a certain buy."

After all this time, this game still holds up.

I played this game when I was much younger, back when mainstream gaming was good and indie was still in its infancy. I wasn't very good at managing my parks or designing rollercoasters back in the day, but I enjoyed every minute of it. The visuals are somewhat dated, but still serve their function well and hold up better than other entries in the series.

Designing parks, creating rollercoasters, even the little things like interacting with guests and creating your own parkgoers makes this a fun experience that has been well worth my time. I have yet to complete every scenario with Tycoon, but I look forward to it!

This game is still by far the best theme park game I personally ever played. It is just relaxing to play and isn't stress full. lets you create your own maps, scenarios, amusement parks, and roller coasters. The game was at least to me very intuitive to learn without the tutorial. Graphics are a bit dated compared to modern games but lets keep in mind this is an old game. Personally I think the graphics hold up pretty well to this day. My only negatives, some buildings wont level to the ground unless the terrain is 100% perfectly flat, Bloom seems to make everything very very bright, turning this setting off at least fixes the issue. That's all i really got to say about the game, I know I do have low play hours on steam for this game, but I have played this game in the past years ago before getting the game again on steam."

Originally released nearly two decades ago, RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 is perhaps still one of the best theme park building games of all time, going toe to toe with titles like Planet Coaster (which - fun fact - was made by the same developer) with its sheer amount of content (including pools and animal exhibits) and rich park simulation mechanics. More so than its predecessors, RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 puts a heavier emphasis on creative, sandbox-style gameplay with improved terrain-editing tools; features like custom firework displays, billboards, and importable music; a revamped scenario system that punishes you less for coloring outside the lines; and of course, the ability to view your park from all angles in 3D space. Although the 3D graphics aren't quite as impressive by today's technical standards, the art direction is still pleasing to the eye and it's easy to spend hours making your park look as beautiful as possible. This aspect of the game can be extended even further by installing some of the wealth of custom scenery objects available online, giving you even greater freedom to design the theme park of your dreams. There are still a few issues with this port though, like the lack of support for resolutions higher than 1920x1080, and the fact that the image browser for custom billboards still refers to a system directory that was removed all the way back in Windows Vista, but it's easy to solve these problems if you're willing to do a little bit of tinkering around.

9.5/10 - A must if you like games where you design things and like theme parks at all in the slightest."

As much as I want to recommend this, I mostly can't. I've got 1,000+ hours in RCT3 and absolutely love the game to death. I can't tell any difference between this Complete Edition and the Platinum Edition that was pulled from the Steam Store. The game was just upscaled to 1080p and things like menu and font sizes weren't even increased to compensate for the larger resolutions.

If you don't have RCT3 and always wanted it, it's worth $20. Otherwise it's a hard pass. Easy refund."

We all (mostly) read the reviews before purchasing a game, we read the negative and hope that when we play....we will not get the same bugs/negative issues that others get. Well, unfortunately the stutters, water flickering, lag is all apparent in my game too. Its such a shame as I loved playing Rollercoaster Tycoon as a teen, but trying to rotate camera or move around the map causes way too much issue to actually enjoy the game.
I have Planet Coaster which is an AMAZING game (highly recommend) but just wanted to chill a little in something more old school. I really hope that they patch some updates so make this playable, and I shall eagerly await that day =)

Having played the original game some years ago on an earlier Windows platform, I loved the game and spent hours, days weeks and months setting up my theme park. It worked fine then with very few glitches. However, I have recently purchased the 'complete edition' from steam and at first I enjoyed once again setting up the game.
The graphics appear to run without a problem, but the music and sound, although appears OK when the game starts, after about 15 minutes of play becomes garbled and jerky. I know it is not my PC ( it is a brand new Dell Desktop with Nvidea card and 8 GB of memory )

Saw that this game was re-released in 2020, so I thought I would give it a try since I was a HUGE fan of the original. I honestly can't say how this game plays because the user interface is completely too small to actually play it. I don't want to have to squint and hunch forward in order to see what is on the screen. I honestly can't believe they didn't think to make the UI more compatible with modern setups, considering that they re-released this game a year ago. The font and icons are just ridiculous! I only paid $4.99 for the game, so I'm not as furious as I would be if I paid the full $20....but this may end up as another game I have on Steam that never gets played.

Up front, if you already own Platinum Edition from a couple years ago before it was taken off of the store due to Atari being Atari, this doesn't have a whole lot of improvements in comparison to make it worth it to upgrade for most people. While I don't mind too much, I do think a couple more quality-of-life improvements wouldn't have hurt to justify getting a more recent version.

That being said, if you never had a chance to own it or had a disc but lost it, this is still one of the best theme park games out there! RCT3 with all of it's included expansions has a ton of content on it's own. It's a little bit dated on the graphics as this is still a game that came out 16 years ago, but turning the settings to max and setting the draw distance and LOD sliders to max can still make beautiful looking parks (especially at night!) and the rest is charming in its own way.

Compared to Frontier's other popular roller coaster game franchise, Planet Coaster has a more free-form approach while RCT3 uses a grid-based system for just about everything like the older games in the franchise. I personally like working with grids more as it's less of a hassle to line things up to look good so this is a positive for me, but someone who prefers absolute freedom in placement would better like Planet Coaster instead.

For what it's worth, I'm still having fun with this game all these years later. And I'm sure anyone even mildly interested in making a theme park to either trill or torture guests will find a lot of enjoyment out of this to this day!"

Absolute Nostalgia trip of a game, and also a pretty solid game by itself

Its graphics are not exactly what you would say ""pretty"", but i'd say that gives it some sort of charm, expecially when you look at the guests models, absolutelly basic, you can count the amount of polygons on it, but yet its charming and pretty.

Gameplay itself is ye olde RCT game, fun park management gameplay with square grid to build on, building and decorating is somewhat more restrict than the other games though, due to the game not allowing clipping most of the time, but oh well, nothing a few cheats and commands can't do.

Guests feel alive, the most they have ever felt in any RCT game, they walk in groups, do some cool little interactions (hug, fight, take photos, etc) and overall just make the game more cute.

Really if you like park management games, either for the management part or to just build coasters, this game is probably for you"

Anyway, from my Platinum review:
Still one of my favorite coaster & theme park games of all time. RCT3 is basically the classic RCT's in a early 2000s 3D engine. Chris Sawyer was involved overseeing the project.

good
- general content & coaster variety
- waterparks, pools & slides
- massive sandbox with all rides and scenery available
- peeps use transport rides in a meaningful way
- ghost trains in testing mode
- isometric view option

bad
- UI & menus
- single-core limitations
- peep groups won't fill queues like in classic titles
- some of the landscaping tools are questionable"

I was locked out in 2010 by Atari who set it up so you could not install it on more then three computers. Well in the time I had it it was moved from PC to PC and uninstalls did not count. Being able to play it again is pure joy. They did fix some bugs in the game. The people used to get stuff in the rotating tower, and that seems to have been fixed.

One of the game series from my childhood. When I was a kid, I was able to play the first game for only a very short time, but could play Theme Park anytime, which is also a great game. Well, this one is way better than the original RollerCoaster Tycoon, the mechanics are even impressive for 2004. I do find it pretty expensive for such an old game, especially since it had practically no improvements so far, but it went on a good off-sale and I could pick it up. Of course there is the much more up-to-date Planet Coaster, it's way heavier for me and split in DLCs, but surely looks like a great game. Anyway, this full game is nice indeed, but I only recommend to buy it when off-sale. Only one annoying aspect: you can't rollback changes if you do a mistake, that's very neat, isn't it? lol

Uma das séries de jogos da minha infância. Quando era criança, pude jogar o primeiro jogo apenas por um tempo muito curto, mas podia jogar Theme Park a qualquer hora, o qual também é um ótimo jogo.

Eu o acho muito caro para um jogo tão antigo, sobretudo porque não teve praticamente qualquer melhoria desde então, mas entrou em uma boa promoção e pude pegá-lo. Claro que há o muito mais moderno Planet Coaster, que é bem mais pesado para mim e dividido em DLCs, mas certamente parece um ótimo jogo. De qualquer forma, este jogo completo é muito bom mesmo, mas só recomendo comprar numa promoção. Apenas um aspecto chato: você não pode reverter alterações caso cometa um erro, isto é ótimo, não acha? lol"

I've been wanting to review Machinarium anyway, but amazingly it was just updated a matter of days ago. This little treasure from Amanita Design has been brought fully into the present with modern resolution support, controller options, and a pretty hilarious bug that makes it run super fast if you try to G-Sync it. Despite that last bit this update has wiped out any criticism I could have leveled at the game for feeling dated or being clunky, leaving only the clunky charms of its trash robot inhabitants to recommend to you without reservation.

Machinarium is the tale of a little robot in a junkyard. He isn't WALL-Eing the place up, he was dumped out here and it's up to you to find out why. A quick jaunt across the wastes finds him in a towering mechanical city of similarly junky, quirky robots all needing your help. Somewhere in the great beeping metropolis is a secret that only you can uncover, and a plot that only you can unravel to save its clanking inhabitants.

Doing this is sure to be one of the most adorable gaming experiences of your life. Your little robo-buddy toddles along on two baton-like legs, snakes his little grabbers out to nab things, drops items into his flip-top maw, and takes in the world with the most precious, gormless stare you can imagine. Just having him on the screen will put a smile on your face, and when he starts tooling around in carts and tumbling off of ladders you really can't help but sensibly chuckle. The other denizens of the city are no less charming, with uptight patrol bots stomping around, mechanical street bands tooting on old pieces of pipe, and clockwork bugs humming happily through the alleys.

It's a living game world in a way that so many other titles can't seem to capture, and it's ironic that it's accomplished entirely with robots. Much like Primordia every robot has their own distinct character but here, it is expressed entirely without words. As with all Amanita games the only language you'll here is perky gibberish, leaving characters to communicate through wild gesticulation and the occasional thought bubble. It's the little details in the art and animation that make it work so well, all the way down to your robot's eyes narrowing when enacting small revenge on a tormentor, or the way he adjusts his metal plates when left idle long enough. And more than anything this helps the story, which has some emotional twists that are heightened by the players emoting their little metal hearts out for.

As excellent as the look and feel is, we can't forget the puzzling. Machinarium, much like other Amanita games, only allows limited ranges of movement on most screens. While this opens up more later in the game it can feel limiting, but the trade-off is that it becomes easier to find what you need to interact with and how to interact with it. Almost as a concession to this point, your robot can stretch or shrink his height to reach out-of-the-way items or blend in with taller or shorter robots, a gimmick used to full effect throughout the entire game. You won't be finding a ton of items, either, so combined with the limited movement and interaction points this should be a pretty simple game for anyone to get through.

Your journey in this mechanical wonderland shouldn't take more than two hours, but those are two hours just loaded with humor and charm. The sketchy art style itself is a joy to behold, with rich details in every surface and object. A subdued soundtrack accompanies the look in a way that gives more texture to the troubled city, offsetting some of the silliness with a reminder that not all is well in the mysterious metropolis. And with the recent updates, any concerns about compatibility or accessibility have been entirely wiped away. With so many fully-realized elements, Machinarium is a clear classic of the point-and-click genre, one that makes an excellent entry point for newcomers or a charming diversion for veterans alike.

This, has to be the most compelling story I've ever played through in a game. One of the best, most charmingly clever, point & click titles I've ever played, a masterpiece of a game. The rustic hand drawn graphics are genuinely exquisite and really help disguise the click areas of this game. Features a really touching twisted fate mecha-folkstory, of a young robot living in a steam-punk dystopian wasteland, trying to save an enslaved princess robot. The only dialog between the characters are small animated scenes inside thought bubbles, which I think is a cool way to help tell a story without literal or verbal ques. The music is beautiful, very original and thought provoking, it really helped set the tone. You'll come across the occasional puzzle here and there and they're are some tough ones, but none are too frustrating. Unlike many titles in this genre, Machinarium consistently had me at an ""aHa!"" moment, great game 10/10"

A charming game that places an indefatigable and likable android protagonist in an overall melancholy and wistful setting of crumbling edifices, broken machines, and seedy robots. (Naturally, as developer of Primordia, I find this a very congenial setup.) The game has no dialogue or text, and it aspires less to high philosophy than to episodic cartoon travails, but this works quite well and doesn't overstay its welcome. Beautiful artwork and excellent music round out the charm.

The puzzles are more in the vein of a Flash game than a traditional point-and-click (frequently they are focused on a single room, and typically they involve minigame logic challenges rather than inventory-based problem solving), but they are fair and in some instances quite clever. I found the integrated hint system, which I used a couple of times, less than fully helpful.

All said, this is a favorite of critics and players alike for good reason -- it is a game with character and integrity, available for a song."

Machinarium has delivered one of the most memorable game experiences that will stay with you for years to come. This is a game that would be in my all time favourite indie game list if I had one and here’s why:

Using this type of artwork for a video game was a really good idea. The game’s not new anymore, yet it looks like it could have been made in 2020. It’s artistic in a way that makes it ageless. Every scene looks like a painting - if nothing else, it’s just beautiful to look at. Furthermore, bringing in the theme of a machine city, gives it a very Gigerish feel, if you happen to be familiar with the mastermind behind the Alien movie designs. But where Giger mixed horror with eroticism, Machinarium comes off cute and weird – like steampunk. Machinarium is like steampunk mixed with Giger’s artwork.

Machinarium is first and foremost a puzzle game. The puzzles are strong and tied to logic. I did feel frustrated at times when I was unable to see the solutions, but I always ended up admitting to myself that I had overlooked something of importance and it was not the game designer’s bad choices. The puzzles also help with enhancing the experience in how they’ve been executed. They’re conducted in a makeshift fashion that you would expect from a world that looks like a huge junkyard and solving them feels fun.

Sounds in Machinarium do not carry any articulated messages so any meaningful information is delivered through visual and auditory imagery. They did stumble here a bit with the most obvious case being the usage of the word „Oil”, which did stand out as a failure where it was occurred. I wish they had stayed true to the main principle without any exception. It’s usually tricky to pull off, but if used correctly then the effect is very strong and really helps with putting one’s fantasy to work.

Besides puzzles, game obstacles also came in the form of and here Machinarium pays homage to many classic games including arcade games. Boy did I have fun with the mini games of Machinarium! The only letdown was the one you had to play if you wanted hints to help you with the puzzles. I wish they had made it more dynamic and interesting. Currently it just feels like chores you have to endure if you wish to see some hints.

To , I wish to bring out the most important: the game feels and looks iconic. Overall it was a very well executed, emotionally satisfying and challenging experience which will get my highest recommendations."

Machinarium was the first video game I've ever played, so I like to look at it as the start of my adventure behind the computer screen.

I think I was around 13 at the time. We didn't have a console or gameboy at home and the only previous contact I had had with games happened when I went to my friend's place to play FIFA on his PS2. I remember there was only one computer in my place and it was my dad's work laptop. We barely ever touched it.

One day my father came home with a usb pen which he took from a colleague by mistake. It had this game inside (probably an illegal copy). After having finished it, my dad gave me and my younger sisters permission to use his laptop to play Machinarium. He even encouraged us to play it, sort of like when he tried to convince us to read good books. This on itself tells a lot about the game, considering how conservative my father used to be when it came to video games.

Anyway, from then on we started gathering in front of the computer screen every day to play the game one hour each time. It was everyone's favourite part of the day. Everyone looked forward to the time just before dinner when my father used to get home. He'd open the laptop, launch the game and we'd all get absorbed by these , the and the . Eventually my mom joined in and soon this became something we'd do as a family every day (we're five). Can you imagine five people in front of a laptop playing a point-and-click game? Ye, it's as weird as it sounds.

The interesting part is my parents don't even like video games or technology in general. They are bookworms more than anything else and for instance they are heavily against my usage of the PC for entertainment. But somehow... somehow this game captivated them. Somehow they were able (more like eager) to spend an hour of their busy lives to take part in this adventure. And the fact that I was able to immerse myself in this together with my parents and sisters, makes me look back at this time of my life with fondness and gratitude. Fondness towards the fact that this game united my family and brought us closer together. And gratitude towards my father for having introduced me to video games in the best way possible... through a game with an , , a (one of the best soundtracks I've heard) and . This game will always have a special place in my heart and I couldn't recommend it more.

PS: I eventually bought this game on Humble Bundle to support the devs but I haven't played it since.
PS2: It's funny that the trigger that started my video game adventure 6 years ago was pulled by my parents, who were so against this kind of stuff to start with. Little did they know..."

Amanita Design's best known game is probably their worst one, since it's a more conventional point-and-click adventure than the weirder Samorosts. And it comes with everything annoying you might expect from an adventure: moon logic, long unskippable animations, and arbitrary restrictions.

The latter are actually relatively rare—it mostly makes sense why you can or can't do anything. However, there is a twist: your robot can only interact with items within his reach and he has three modes (tall, normal, short)... which means that that thingie might have been unclickable simply because you forgot to switch modes. Which you will, because in any non-normal mode the robot's speed slows down to a crawl.

Why does everyone like so much then? Because what it lacks in usability, it more than compensates for in heart. This is a very lovely game with a charming story and incredible sound design.

I think beats at almost everything it tries to achieve. But if you've played it already, don't pass this one either. Amanita Design's care and attention to detail shines in this as well."

I bought this game out of pure nostalgia but realised how amazing of a game it is. I discovered it when I was around 9 years old, and I stumbled upon a CD of this game while rummaging through old stuff. Well, my 9-year-old self struggled to progress beyond playing less than 20% of the game and I eventually give up. Any progress I made was thanks to the hint mini-game within the game itself. Even now, I still found the game quite challenging, yet incredibly enjoyable!

Speaking about the game itself, the artwork and musical ambiance are simply fantastic. This game genuinely tests your problem-solving abilities. I was so proud of myself for completing the game without relying on any hints this time around (lol). With that said, I wholeheartedly recommend this game! Everyone should give this a try.

While I admit that the game's duration is relatively short for its price, I believe it's still worth the money :)

This game was such a nice find because it offered me a truly a wonderful experience :D"

Just WOW! If you like a good adventure game with lots of things to explore, some hard puzzles and beautiful artwork, then Machinarium is your game.

Without a single spoken word the story line is set very well in a world where machines have feeling too. The ambiance is amazing and the puzzles very original. You just gotta love the main character and the creative ways he finds to defeat the bad guys. The humor in the game is great too.

For me this game could have lasted for several hours (days, weeks!) more, without ever boring me. The game also offers a unique hint system, so there's no need to search the internet to be able to advance in case you're stuck. I recommend not using it too often though, because the game is much more fun by solving everything yourself.

If machines ever take over the world, I sure hope this is what it will look like. The downside? Maybe the fact that there's no Steam achievements. Really can't think of anything else. This game is a must-have & must-play!"

I, a robot?

Adventure is only a point-and-click away as Irreverend Opinions reviews Machinarium!

---

The Blurb

A puzzle adventure in a stylised world of robots and amazing music. A robot that has been abandoned by his city in pieces must pull himself together and return to not only confront some rather bad robots, but save his robot girlfriend in the process.

The Good

The first thing I noticed about Machinarium, as a first impression, is the music. The soundtrack by Czech composer really stands out in the task of impressing a strange new world without alienating the player from what they are engaged in.

Graphically, the art style for Machinarium is quite striking, with hand-drawn animation hauntingly evocative of works by surrealist Jan Švankmajer, and seeming to be another achievement for Dvorský that fans of Amatina Design will be encouraged to see. With their pencil-and-paper 'living comic' art style, the organic appearance of the background and characters helps to round out the artificial world with a warm and almost human sense, which helps the player to get involved with the characters quite readily.

For an adventure game without dialogue at all, the plot is quite memorable and involving, with the characters having both impact and personality. By removing dialogue from the game, the designers also allow the game to be accessible to players who do not speak English, using thought bubbles and pictures, authentic instruments and short beeps or buzzes to illustrate what characters are thinking or asking.

Puzzles throughout the game are both thought-provoking and challenging, sometimes requiring the player to think outside the box to complete tasks without pushing for weird feats of skewed logic present in some games of the genre. Should the game prove to be too much of a bother, an in-built 'hint' system allows players to get some suggestions to how they can complete the task.


For some players, the puzzles will be a bit challenging, though thankfully a short minigame can help to unlock the puzzles if you are more of a mind to do a reflexive shooter than a point-and-click puzzle solve.

Some players have reported having issues with transferring the game from fullscreen to windowed mode, though this seems to be more of a UI confusion than a bug issue.


None to speak of.


Turn out the lights and enjoy the immersive, imaginative world.


Well deserving of the awards it has recieved, Machinarium is a beautiful game with something special for art and music lovers, as well as fans of the point-and-click puzzle genre. 10/10."

Machinarium is a must play for fans of puzzle/adventure/point-and-click games

Reasons to play:
Beautiful artstyle
Clever puzzles
Inspired world
Heartwarming story and characters
Innovative hint system
Negatives:
Very short
Not optimal controls and mechanics
Difficult? (this might be a negative)





At this point in time, Machinarium should be revered as a modern classic in the adventure game genre. It stands the test of time as an indie wonder which not only sparked an interest for the minimalist story-telling but brought back puzzle adventure games from the brink of Lucas Arts deathbed. As of writing this review I have replayed the game after not touching it for about 10 years, this time using an iPad. It is not truly an iPad review, neither can I accurately talk about the PC port more than the fact that they are very similar and I can happily recommend both.

I did refer to Lucas Arts, but truly Machinarium does not fully operate in the same space. Instead of dialogue driven adventures, Machinarium is more heavily reliant on puzzles. The inventory and item spamming on any interactive object or character is still there, but so are a good bunch of logic puzzles that take center-stage. This keeps a nice balance of the creative item interactions and the more logic driven brain teasers, without being too farfetched nor high IQ for the everyday player. Interactions with other characters are communicated with what I could describe as ""supply and demand"" thought bubbles that tells you how to progress or how to help out your fellow robot friend, while solutions are often narrowed down to a small amount of options. Even though you several times after finally finding a solution, smack your head because you should have found that solution earlier than you did. It is fun, satisfying and clever. Sometimes too clever for you, which brings me to a nice point. The hints.

Growing up with the likes of Lucas Arts games, in the time of no walkthroughs available, I think I developed thick skin to the most grueling and downright idiotic puzzles. Therefore I would never be the one to complain when a puzzle gets me really stuck, as I've seen many players do nowadays. Nevertheless the very player friendly hint system at play in Machinarium should be cherished. It consists of a hint button which gives 1 obscure hint (and 1 only) in the screen you're visiting, and a walkthrough book which are unlocked for the specific screen by playing a small minigame. The game thus challenges your patience by a minigame for you to be able to advance, which I think is a cute solution to the hint debacle which plagues present players. Did it have to exist? No. Am I happy it does? Certainly.

What about the game in general? The art is delivered in a warm palette, steampunk charm and rusty robotics. It is a city for the machines, where oil drinking, jazz bands, arcades and robot deities and coppers are prevalent. It is a city of ill-doers and bullies, old and young, lonely and lovely, cats and bugs. Spite it's cold robot heart, it is packed with character and adventure feel. Your protagonist can make himself bigger and smaller like an accordion which is easily accessible and if you idle for too long you will receive a flashback to happier times with your robot love. The sound design is delightful, while the story is just about right. The game could have been expanded upon and been given a more resonating ending, but as it stands, Machinarium is a great effort.

Some nitpicks though. If you want to interact with an object you have to move your character first to the spot to reach, which means traversing the world sometime isn't as smooth. Movement can also not be cancelled, so you might be making a wrong step and do a bunch of back and forth in this game, as movement animations can't be sped up either. But all in all these are minor complaints about time saving, which you won't need as the game is at max 4 hours long anyways.

A must play for adventure/puzzle game enthusiasts, a fringe game for those not familiar and a calming game for those that enjoy art and thought exercises. If not for the PC longplays, buy it for the tablet and just enjoy a soothing evening in the sofa."

Machinarium is a point-and-click adventure game in the old fashion of ""click inventory items against everything on screen until it works"". You play the role of a tiny little robot dude whose first task is to rebuild his body, having been unceremoniously dumped into a junkyard.

The story is told without any words, instead using the charming artstyle and clever worldbuilding to convey what's happening. It's a risky venture, especially in story-driven games like these, but Machinarium pulls it off very well; Little Robot Dude's attempts to sneak back into the city are easy to follow and very cute.

Some of the puzzles can be somewhat obtuse, as is the norm for adventure games, which may put off some players, but there is a hint system built into every puzzle which lets Dude give his own insight on the solution. For times when this doesn't suffice, a short walkthrough can be unlocked with some skill at a minigame, which will give the player a storybook guide on what to do next. The wordless presentation makes Machniarum a game that can be enjoyed by all-comers of any language, age, or skill with words.

Finally, the Robot Street Band's performance will stay with you forever."

An oldie but goodie - for the ~5 hours for my playthrough, I enjoyed my time spent in Machinarium. Recommended for some casual time-killing. I played it as a break from more intense games.

Gameplay
Machinarium is a straightforward point and click game. I liked how the main character can extend and shrink, which adds an element to the puzzle. For example, if there's an item you can't reach at the normal height, sometimes you have to realize you have to extend the main character to reach the item.

The puzzles I'd say are of middling difficulty, being an occasional point and click game player. The developers have put a nice touch of illustrated walkthroughs, right in-game! (I just looked up screenshots of them on the Steam community, one of the guides has all of the screenshots for convenient access.)

Now, even with occasional looking at the developer walkthrough when stuck, it still took me ~5 hours to complete the game, so I'd say go for it unless you're trying for some perfectionist run. All the achievements are mandatory if you complete the game, i.e. none are missable achievements, so it's not a big deal to avoid all guides.

As this game is made by Amanita Design, it has their signature art style, which is a treat to the eyes. Even after so many years, the graphics still hold up as unique and paints a fascinating world. The music, in typical Amanita Design games quality, is whimsical and has a flavor of its own. So I know that with these two aspects, I'm in good hands when it comes to an Amanita game.

The main story isn't that interesting, and I'd go as far to say it's pretty generic. But I enjoyed exploring the world of Machinarium and some of the NPCs have more interesting background, though it's left pretty ambiguous in the game. So I'd say I enjoyed the art and music direction, just enjoying the environment, and the story was more in the background.

Overall, Machinarium is a game that still holds up graphically and is a high quality and pleasant experience, 10 years after release. There have been so many instances of it being on sale, so if you got it for cheap, it's worthwhile to play it when you're killing time or just as a break from other types of games."

This is a great pack with a unique assortment of games. All of them work over the web, which is a big plus.

- Quiplash 3: It's good ol' quiplash. Can't go wrong with this one. The prompts are good, and there are custom packs if you get bored of the defaults. The last lash is always the same- every player gives 3 answers to a prompt. I'm not a huge fan of this, but meh. It's quiplash.

- The Devils and the Details: This is my favorite, simply because of the chaos it creates. Players yelling at each other to finish collaborative tasks, scolding the selfish players, and freaking out when there is an emergency. It can get a little old, but the wide variety of ""scenarios"" keeps it fresh enough.

- Champ’d Up: Head-to-head drawing game. Pretty fun even if you suck at drawing. Playing multiple games in a row allows for comedic callbacks, since the game lets you ""tag in"" drawings from previous games. It gets pretty silly.

- Talking Points: This is a close second favorite. Players have to bulls**t their way through a wacky presentation. It's fun to make up something as fast as possible on the spot. Lots of improv is involved. I wish there were more images to choose from- when images repeat it gets a little less funny. The custom mode is pretty fun if you have creative players. The scoring system kinda sucks.

- Blather 'Round: This is the one I have played the least, but it's interesting. It's not as funny as the other games, but it's still very entertaining to try to deduce what the word is. It's like charades with words. Seems to have good replayability.

Overall, awesome pack that is well worth the asking price. Plays great over Discord or IRL :)"

This is the first Jackbox Party Pack in which our group felt all 7 games were ""winners"".

Quiplash 3 - The ""Thrip Lash"" is, finally, the perfect structure for the final round of quiplash.

The Devils and the Details - Mechanically has the potential to get the most repetitive, but you'll be having too
much fun shouting at your friends to drive you to the dentist to care.

Champ'd Up - A drawing competition where only one player knows the prompt. The game shines in it's last round, however, when you get a random prompt and have to pick one of your previous drawings to fight for it. This gets very special with repeat plays, as the game keeps your entire roster of drawings around as long as you select ""same players"".

Blather 'Round - ""It's a Spicy Box Place"". ""Taco Bell!"" ""HOW DID YOU GUESS THAT?""

Talking Points - A classic improv game. Give a speech, with no idea what your next slide is going to show. Creates some truly special moments when the assistant selecting pictures and the presenter psychially align. Also you can mash upvotes and downvotes, which is very satisfying."

This is my first honest review of a game, this was also the first game i got on the release day.
love it.

a breath of fresh air from party pack 6, i was unsatisfied about pack 6. this pack felt stale, most of the concepts were just been there done that already. i feel like there was more effort in party pack 5. Party pack 7 has the same feeling as party pack 5, not in the bad way. there was so much more effort in this pack, brand new ideas, cool concepts, and the classic Quiplash.

QUIPLASH 3:
amazing. just, perfect. i LOVE the new style, i LOVE the new music. also the extra funny prompts. but that's it. i was expecting just a little more but i'm content. the brand new settings caught me off-guard though. i will say this, this game somewhat looks incomplete, there are bugs, errors, i had to task manager once. but hopefully its fixed in the future

DEVILS AND THE DETAILS:
just like quiplash 3. amazing. nothing much to say about to say about this one. i will enjoy this with family, by a lot. it's just a good game! honestly my second favorite. (*cough cough* the mom *cough cough*)

CHAMP'D UP:
pure fun. it's like tee ko, but without shirts and the swapping of pictures and captions. honestly it's tee ko 2. love the style on this one. only played a little of this because my friends arnt really the artists. ALSO, when you draw it's not so small on phones anymore.

TALKING POINTS:
just like the others, fun. you make a presentation just like in school! this game is like mad verse city and joke boat, but formal. i used to make stupid slideshows on renderforest, so this is where i shine! stupidity is key.

BLATHER 'ROUND:
mmm, i dunno man. i get how to play and i like it. it's just kinda boring. maybe i dont have the right group or i'm just bad at trivia. not much to say about this one.

I PLAYED THIS GAME WHEN IT CAME OUT. I FOUND LOTS OF TECHNICAL BUGS AND LOTS OF THINGS LOOKED UNFINISHED. hopefully you can spot the ones im talking about and fix them.

and that was my opinion on party pack 7!
much better than the previous with tons of fun games to play with friends and family.
thank you jackbox devs. :))))

EDIT:
i played a bunch of blather 'round, i changed my mind.. in the bad way.
it's super difficult, if your group knows trivia by heart, this is you game.
the clues that the game gives you rarely are helpful.
the worst of the pack.

As always, Jackbox brings hours of laughter to my group of friends.

Favorite game: Champ'd Up.
The drawing tools are expanded from those of previous entries, such as Drawful, allowing for more creativity and freedom in drawing. The fun really kicks in when you draw the challenger, using only your opponent's drawing as a reference point. I definitely recommend using the extended timer so you don't feel as rushed to get your drawing right.

Least favorite: The Devils and the Details.
This game just doesn't flow well for my group of friends, but I still recommend trying it for yourself. It doesn't have the same format as most other Jackbox Party Pack games (Prompt, respond, vote), and is much more continuous and at times hectic. While there is a bit of competition, it's mostly a cooperative game. While this could definitely be a big drawing point for some people, it wasn't very fun for us.

The brain game: Blather Round.
This game is essentially word charades. You choose one of three things (person, place, etc.) and have to vaguely describe it by filling in the blanks of a sentence using a list of terms the game provides. As the round continues, you can form more clues in the same manner while other players try to figure out what you're describing. Lots of fun, and if you're like us you'll end up playing it multiple times in a row and forgetting to try out the other games.

The chill game: Talking Points.
A much less competitive game, but that's not a bad thing. You take turns giving presentations on material you've never seen before, and while you're briefing each slide, another player is creating the next slide. Forces you to think on your feet, and even for a group of people who all hate giving presentations, we had a lot of fun.

Ol' Reliable: Quiplash 3.
If you liked the previous Quiplash entries, you'll like this one. The only real changes are the ability to choose your avatar, and the new final round: Thrip Lash. In Thrip Lash, you give a three-step response to the prompt, with each step being revealed one at a time. We found that some of the prompts in Thrip Lash were weak, but overall it's a solid addition. You also have the ability to create your own prompts in the menu."

Easily the best Jackbox in years. Quiplash 3 continues the high quality of that game, even if little has changed aside from the final round. Champ'd Up is possibly a contender along side Drawful for best drawing game. Blather Round came completely out of left field and is one of the most popular Jackbox games among my friend circle now.

Now for the less glowing critique. I personally really like Talking Points, but it seems to be massively unpopular among those who I have played with, and I understand why. It requires a performative personality and a sense of improvisation that isn't for the shyer folks in your group, and may end up with some people feeling left out. Also, the scoring criteria isn't super clear and seems to be heavily weighted towards those who go later.

I have not had much experience with the Devil and the Details yet and while it seems fun, it is almost impossible to play virtually as it is too hard to coordinate in a video chat when all voices end up drowning each other out. In person, I can see it being a fun collaborative affair, but COVID has unfortunately put the kibosh on that.

Champ'd Up and Blather Round alone make this the best Jackbox since #3 and the one probably most in the spirit of the original games in terms of accessibility and straight of fun. Time will tell if the two games I mentioned as weaker will be more viable once in person gatherings are a thing once more, but regarless the pack gets a strong recommendation."

The Jackbox Party Pack 7 comes with some good games, it is not my favorite though.

Quiplash 3
Always a classic. Always fun. In Quiplash you come up with the best punchline. There are no noteworthy changes except the art style.

Devils in the Details
One of the few co-op Jackbox games, but with a twist: there is still a first place. For me, doing chores virtually is even worse than in real life. On the plus side is that you do not have waiting times.

Champ’d Up
This game can be really, really funny. You draw multiple characters and give them names to win in certain categories. Later, you use the same characters to win other categories, which can lead to hilarious combinations.

Talking Points
This Party Pack does not only have a game where you do chores, it also has a game where you do PowerPoint presentations like you are back in 7th grade. Do not get me wrong, it can be hysterically funny. Just make sure that everybody in your group feels comfortable giving a speech. Otherwise, it can get awkward.

Blather ‘Round
I got this Party Pack only for this. It is like a trivia game, where one person chooses computer-generated hints. It can be a magical moment, when you already gave up because the hints you could give were not so good, but then somebody guesses correctly at the last second.

Keep in mind that you play with one smartphone / tablet or web browser per person. If you want to play with your friends online, you can use Steam Remote Play or Discord. It is still fun."

The Jackbox Party Pack 7 is one of the best Party Packs that has come out recently with 5 different new and unique games that are great for parties and streams.

Since this is 5 games in one I will review each one individually.


If you have played any previous Jackbox games you probably know what Quiplash is. In it every player gets prompts with fill in the blanks that you try to create the funniest answers you can. And then everyone votes on which answer they thought was more clever or funny and then the person with the most points at the end of the game wins.

This version of Quiplash has some unique rounds to spice things up along with obviously an abundance of new prompts. Also you can make your own questions in the game if you want and whats really cool is you can actually play other players custom made questions in a featured content tab so that is awesome. And the artsyle is this really cool looking claymation vibe and so overall this is probably going to be a lot of players favorite game in the pack.


In this every single person is on a team of devils trying to do everyday human chores to fit in. So the gameplay consists of there being a huge list of chores on everyone's phones and when you do them there are small and simple minigames you must complete to get points for the family.

This game overall has a very interesting and unique premise but my problem with it is all the chores you are doing kind of feel like actual chores. I think if the minigames had been a little more fun almost like little Warioware games this could have been incredibly fun but every single task you do consists of you doing the most mundane things ever like looking through a phone book for a specific phone number to type in so it kind of makes the game fall flat a little in my opinion.


This is stupid fun and honestly one of my favorite drawing based Jackbox games ever. In it each player draws and names a champion to fight others and then gets to create another champion to fight another players champion. Then the rounds start and each person votes on who they think would win in a fight and in the later rounds you can tag in your other fighters which is awesome.

And one really cool feature about this game is if you continue playing with the same players across multiple games when it comes time to tag in some of your other fighters you can actually use your fighters from previous games which is super cool. Also the music in this game is way better than it has any right to be.


This is one of the games that you kind of need to have the right group of people to play because it’s less of a competition and more just a fun little experience. In it each player will give speeches kind of like Ted Talks to the other players and when its your turn to give the ted talk another person acts as your assistant by choosing what the words you have to read are and what pictures accompany your power point.

Everyone can like or dislike your speech at any time and that is what determines how many points you get but overall you should just be playing this game to give hilarious speeches to your friends or family and it is pretty fun when you get a group of people to really commit to this game.


This is kind of like a game of charades almost. In it each player chooses a word from a list of 3 and it could be a person, a place, or a thing and when it’s their turn they try to form sentences with a very limited amount of words to give the other players hints.

The entire time the other players are trying to guess the word and sometimes the person who is giving the hints can even include the previous guesses in their hints. So say someone said the hulk but the real word was a different super hero the person giving hints could make a sentence saying “it’s very similar to the hulk”.

And if someone guesses the correct word then they along with the person giving the hints gets points and if they used any other words from other player's guesses they get points as well.

And so overall this one is really fun because I haven’t really played a charades like game in a Jackbox Party Pack and so it is a very fun and unique experience.


And so overall I absolutely loved this party pack. I loved 4 out of the 5 games and the one I didn’t like I didn’t hate I just wasn't a super fan of. If you are a fan of previous Jackbox Party Packs you will definitely enjoy this one!"

Views: 50,905
Usually, with each new Party Pack, you get maybe three good games and two bad ones, so let's see if the latest keeps up that trend in my Jackbox Party Pack 7 review!

Summarized review below!

Another year, another Jackbox Party Pack. My friends and I are huge fans of this series and return to it numerous times throughout the year. Usually, with each new Party Pack, you get maybe three good games and two bad ones, so I was interested in seeing if the latest would keep up that trend.

Quiplash 3 was a good bit of fun. It’s by no means the strongest game in the pack, but it takes the already solid Quiplash formula and delivers the best version yet. You basically answer a series of prompts with what you think is the funniest and best-fitting answer and those answers go up against others in a series of rounds until you get to the multi-answer finale and all the points are tallied up. It’s pretty simple really, but the Jackbox team has done a great job with all the creative prompts, the visuals and music, and just the overall presentation.

This is something you’ll see extend to the other games in the pack as well, they’ve really upped the visual side of things this time around. Regardless, Quiplash 3 is a solid first game for the pack and one my friends and I will be returning to.

The Devils and the Details is easily one of, if not the most, chaotic games I have ever played in any of the Jackbox games. It plays very differently from the rest of the pack, being a co-op survival game of sorts where you each play as a member of a family trying to complete certain tasks before the end of each day. However, each family member has a personal score and it can be increased by completing selfish tasks that harm the rest of the family. This creates this cool dynamic where you’re both trying to help out the rest of the group while also trying to stay above the rest.

The actual tasks are divided into individual and group tasks – with the latter being where the chaos comes into play. They oftentimes require you to instruct another player, but when you have seven or so people playing at once, it quickly becomes a mess of players shouting instructions at others and trying to get everything done by the time limit. It can get very loud, but that’s the point of the game and I quite enjoyed the change of pace compared to the other games’ comedy-centric focus. It may not get the laughs, but it will definitely get the communication going in a chaotic fun sort of way.

Champ’d Up ended up being my favorite game of the pack. Every pack has a drawing game, and Champ’d Up not only expands on the drawing tools offered in the previous packs through colors choices and an undo button, but pits drawings against each other in a very cool way. You’re basically tasked with drawing something against another drawing without knowing the category that the two are competing in – only the original drawer knows the category. This can create some very cool matchups and the worse your drawing skill, the funnier it becomes.

This was one of the two games in the pack where my group literally couldn’t breath because we were laughing so hard at some of the drawings, and the way the game facilitates these matchups just makes it all that much better. Jackbox always seems to knock it out of the park with the drawing games and Champ’d Up is no exception.

Talking Points is the game that had the most laughs from my group. And not just regular laughs, but the kind where you find yourself wheezing. It’s a presentation-style game where you have one player presenting on a topic they know nothing about and another player feeding the first player new text and picture slides for their slideshow. As the presenter does not know what slide is coming up next, there is a ton of adlibbing involved, but that’s what really makes the game shine. You gotta somehow link together all of these unrelated images and lines and it can lead to some pretty funny moments.

For example, I pitched my presenter an image of a squirrel, then sausages, and then house keys, and he managed to weave it together into this werewolf narrative that had the rest of the group dying. It’s definitely the simplest game in the pack in terms of its design, but it’s got some top-tier execution and provides a solid foundation for a simple, yet fun party game – the type you can just bust out with any group and get to playing.

Blather 'Round is without a doubt the weakest game in the pack. It’s not outright bad, but it definitely doesn’t click like the rest of the games do. It’s basically a trivia game played using word charades. You get a word and have to convey it through a limited set of other words and player guesses as they come in. What my group found was that a lot of the prompts are simply too hard, even the ones marked as “easy”. For example, I would get something like Bikini Bottom, which you would think would be at least somewhat easy to pitch, but the clues are so abstract that half of my group was guessing oceans and lakes and such and the other half was guessing coastal cities.

Of course, just like the other games in the pack, this is all going to depend on the group you play with. Blather 'Round is just the type of game that is better played among those that like trivia games (and this is coming from someone that does).

The Jackbox Party Pack 7 is yet another solid addition to the series, definitely one of the better ones. It’s got some really good highlights – most notably Champ’d Up and Talking Points – but some other fun additions as well – Quiplash 3 and The Devils and the Details. The only one that didn’t quite stick was Blather ‘Round, but even then, it’s not outright bad like the usual bad game included in past Party Packs. If anything, this might be the most well-rounded pack yet.

the+jackbox+party+pack+7,Recommended,19.6,"Posted: August 13, 2021
By far, in my opinion, this is the best Jackbox Party Pack I have ever purchased, and played, thus far.
Through Sub-category, reviewing each segment, as the entirety of the game.

1.)Quiplash 3:
The third one in the series, this is a game of wits/clever commentary within about a minute to answer gap, per round. You are given a category, to fill in what you feel would be or not be the best answer for that category, and you generally compete against other people, each person in your party having their own category, besides the one(s) you compete with.
👍This game is really fun, and they even have separate episodes in the options to choose from, for folks who may be getting married, for children and/or a sports team. Overall, this game has a lot of re-play value, and is especially great for friends or family you are close with. Bear in mind too, that you can include an outside audience, if you so chose to do so. :)

2.) The Devils and the Details:
You start as a 'devil' family, over-going daily chores as a family, sometimes having to involve other parts of the family to complete tasks. However, be aware, also, there is one task that is in red, and causes trouble for the rest of the family, and if the person so chooses to pick that task, the other family members have a chance to stop the devious motive.
👍This game is especially fun with family and/or close friends. However, I do feel it could be repetitive, were it to be played too much.

3.):
Get ready to show off your creative and/or possibly not creative but hilarious skills of drawing. Each round, you are given a subject of which what your drawing would be deemed the ""champion of [random category]"" The first part of each round, a person is given this prompt, and then, the second part of the round, the player is given the other player's champion, and has to create a worthy opponent for this champion, pay mind, the second round person involved is not aware of what the first person round's drawing is the champion of, and have to base it off of the drawing.
👍This game is great, especially with the drawing mechanics, and choices between different pen styles, and different colors. The avatars chosen at the beginning of the game are fun. My family has found it to be quite hilarious, even creating ""champions"" that make a comeback in following games, and we have a lot of fun, creating new champions. However, this game may not be for everyone, especially if they lack the desire to draw. But even, if you feel you do not possess the ability to draw, it can still be a fun game, for everyone.

4.):
This game is a true pop culture game where you are given a category [people, places, things, etc] and it may or may not involve time eras that your party have knowledge there of. However, that does not lose it's charm. You have to make your party guess what it is that you are trying to tell them (the subject you had chose at the beginning of the round) and when they guess, you, the person in charge of the subject chosen, may also use what the other players clues to guess the subject to what it is you are trying to reveal. Whoever guesses the subject, also earns points. Anyone involved in the cluing toward the subject, if the main player chose your guesses in the category round, also get points.
👍No matter of different time eras and possibly not knowing what the subject may be, this game has a lot of fun and cause people to be in cahoots about it. The ultimate goal is to guess the subject. Whether you like to be clever, and/or immature about things, this game is full of fun.

5.):
Imagine trying to sell a product, or making a powerpoint about something. This is exactly what the game is. You are trying to convince your audience that your item, is the best. However, it doesn't necessarily have to be this way. You are given a powerpoint, and an assistant (*ahem* another player in your party) to help you with the powerpoint. You create the context, and your assistant gets to choose a powerpoint slide that is given by the game, that they would feel would fit most (or possibly not fit most) to your speech. You can draw on the photo, creating more hysterically lasting memories. Each player gets to make a comment at the end of the powerpoint, and vote on which one they felt was best, at the end.
👍I do not feel this game may be for everyone, however, it can grow quite hilarious, depending on the party you play with. Clever-minded to immaturity, this game is overall fun."

No disclaimer about the fact that I'm European this time around. This Jackbox Party Pack has a Filter for US-Centric content, to make it accessible to the broader audience around the world. Definitely a welcomed addition. You might still note that all of those games were played with the aforementioned option turned on.

Do I recommend the Jackbox Party Pack 7?
- YES, GET IT AT ALL COSTS!!

Individual game review:

Quiplash 3:
- A classic of the Jackbox Games.
- The best of all.
- Simple and fun.
- Infinitely replayable.
Schmitty's back for some more Quiplashing. The concept of Quiplash just never gets old. It's easy to understand in 2 sentences, it's hilarious and moreover, its third round FINALLY was improved with THREE answers to input in a prompt. This leaves space for even more creativity and laugh moments. The ""make your own"" mode is still there even. I think they've really hit the spot here. My personal note is 10/10.

The Devils and the Details:
- Developed from what was an April Fools' joke.
- Cooperation game with a tiny bit of deception.
- Interesting concept of interactive tasks on phone.
The cooperative game that will really get the interest of Jackbox players. It is fun in its own way (perhaps different from the rest of the series). There is a complexity to it. It marries cooperation and individualism very well. It has many challenges and the theme is just well made. It is however barely playable on a browser or so I'm told, so try to play it on your smartphone. A mic might sometimes be required. It must also be better if played with all players in the same room. Personal note is .


- The best drawing game ever made by Jackbox.
- Hilarious battle of drawings.
- Leaves space for creativity.
- AMAZING SOUNDTRACK!
Everything is in the lines above. The concept well detailed and easy to understand. Despite being a drawing game, it proved absolutely hilarious and accessible. So many twists. It has an infinite replayability. The universe is absolutely awesome. Nothing else to say, that's in my top 3 of my favourite games from Jackbox. Most of my friends approve as well. Personal note is .


- Will definitely please the fans of Patently Stupid.
- Can be tricky to understand at first, stressful if first timers are talking first.
- Can be quite funny once people grab the concept.
- Room for creativity pretty much everywhere.
Met with a bit of mixed opinions at first in my own sessions. Despite that, if people understand it and are able to improvise, it can prove to be very funny. The speaker and the assistants' thinking and cooperation is what will make their presentation hilarious. It is best played with a mic. It has to be a lot better if done in front of a big screen with all players in the same room, like Patently Stupid. I have to try that out one day. Personal note is .


- Very tricky, even with the US-Centric filter on.
- Satisfying when you find the answer.
- Requires players making others guess to think a lot to succeed
The less funny game of the pack, but not a bad one. It basically calls for some basic trivia and guesswork. That said, the concept is easy, it's using it that isn't as the host of the guess. Could definitely benefit from some additions in terms of possibilities when creating a sentence. My personal note is .


The best Jackbox Party Pack EVER CREATED. To this day, as 2020, I can only recommend that you get this pack above any other. It is the funniest, most accessible and replayable pack Jackbox has ever made. Very good Job, developers, this one will probably be the most played and requested one until - one can wish - The Party Pack 8!"

Remember the first time we met?
You was at the mall wit' yo' friend
I was scared to approach ya, but then you came closer
Hopin' you would give me a chance
Who would have ever knew
That we would ever be more than friends?
We're real worldwide, breaking all the rules
She like a song played again and again
That girl, like somethin' off a poster
That girl, is a dime they say
That girl, is a gun to my holster
And she's running through my mind all day, ayy"

I debated buying it because I own basically every other pack... but this is seriously a MUST! Every single game in here is a winner, unlike other packs. Every game adds something totally new and unique.

Devils in the details has surprisingly, well, *detailed* mini games and tasks which are super cool! MINI GAMES! IN A JACKBOX PACK!!!!

Blather round is the token trivia game of the pack, and it doesn't let you down. it's super funny to try and describe things incredibly vaguely.

Champ'd up is probably my favorite game in the pack, and favorite drawing game of ANY jackbox pack. They've improved on the drawing system so much for a cleaner experience, and the idea of tailoring your champion onto someone elses is so genius and leads to serious laughs.

Talking points is great for larger groups especially, but not so great for shyer friends. I've personally had the biggest laughs with this game, and with the right people its for sure the most memorable.

Finally, an updated version of quiplash that improves upon the pacing of previous versions.

This pack is the best pack out there. Get this one! I will be playing this pack much more than others."

Definitely the best Jackbox to date. Quiplash 3 fixed the only issues I had with the final round of the game feeling pretty hit or miss. The Devils and the Details is extremely hectic and Champ'd Up is another great drawing game. Talking Points is a perfect spiritual successor to Patently Stupid and adds a good amount of chaos to it. Blather 'Round might be my favorite Jackbox game to date. Overall the whole pack is varied and extremely fun."
the+jackbox+party+pack+7,Recommended,20.1,"Posted: October 15, 2020
They're all pretty good
Quiplash 3 is just Quiplash with new prompts
The Devils and The Details is a pretty good co-op/competitive game where you need to get as many tasks done as possible to contribute towards a goal with an option to take selfish tasks that give you more points but can cause a disaster. Some tasks on phones can be annoying if you swipe down too hard and refresh ur page by accident.
Champ'd Up is where you get a prompt to draw something and another player will draw a competitor to match without the prompt which can be fun.
Talking points is do a silly TED talk and can be good if you like the speech based games.
Blather Round is where you get a famous person, character, story etc. and have to describe it using the ingame prompts and it can be hard but it really depends on how quick your friends can be to catch on.
Overall i'd rate this in the top 3 jackbox games with 4 and 6 :)"
the+jackbox+party+pack+7,Recommended,20.1,"Posted: March 9, 2021
The most recent entry at the time of writing, and also by far the best pack. 4 out of the 5 games in The Jackbox Party Pack 7 are exceptional party games that knock every other instalment in this series out of the water. Champ'd Up is an endlessly entertaining game about creating characters and putting them head to head to compete in strange and specific tournaments, and is the best game in this pack. Quiplash 3 is the most recent Quiplash, and is probably the most famous Jackbox game, a simple but very effective game about answering prompts and voting for the funniest answers. Talking points is a great improv game where you present a power point presentation while your partner makes it at the same time, using quick thinking very important. The Devils and the Details is a very chaotic coop game where you complete as many warioware-esque microgames as possible to blend in with human society. Blather Around is the weakest entry, essentially just verbal charades, but you can ignore it's difference in quality due to how great the other 4 games are in this pack. I would strongly recommend this pack above each other one in the series, it's easily the best in the series, both for someone brand new to Jackbox, or someone who owns and has played every previous on before. 9/10"

Jackbox Party Packs come in all shapes and sizes, and include a number of different games within them. So I'll break down this review based on types of games in this pack:

CO-OPERATIVE PLAY!
This pack includes some AWESOME cooperative play games. Devils and the Details is a crazy fun game where you work together to complete random challenges. It involves a lot of yelling so make sure your microphone is working for this one!
But the real star of the show is Blather Round, a creative take on the classic Password. You basically try to describe your prompt using awkward language (e.g. you might us ""sad liquid event"" to get people to guess Titanic). I've played this game with family, friends, and even random strangers online, and it is always a blast. Worth the price of admission 👍🏼

FUNNY
Quiplash is a lot of fun, a great game to play with friends. Basically you're just trying to give the funniest or most amusing responses to prompts.

DRAWING
Champ'd Up is a high energy game where you draw and name characters, and vote for the best ones. I still like Drawful a bit better, but the music and the whole vibe of this game makes it stand out.

TRIVIA
This party pack is not the best game option if you just want to play a straight trivia challenge. For trivia heads I'd recommend looking into Party Pack 5 or 6 instead."

Okay so I have played every game at least twice and i've tried to be as unbiased as possible.

Quiplash 3: Honestly, just some good old quiplash but with a cleaner art style and better music. One of the stronger games in the pack but like what do you expect, it's quiplash.

The Devils and The Details: I honestly love those chaotic games where you're just shouting at your friends and this game just perfectly encapsulates that. I think my friend group are just ♥♥♥♥♥

Champ'd Up: Literally just a better version of tee k o. A nice setting and im so glad you can see what you're going up against in this game, it makes it make way more sense, a pretty nice drawing game overall.

Talking Points: One of my favourite games in the pack, it's bascically improv patently stupid and i LOVE it, i cant tell you specifically why though, it has a nice clean aesthetic and a laugh.

Blather round: I went into blather round not thinking I would like it because i'm not really a fan of trivia games in general, but this one is a nice change of pace to just chill out and play at the end of a jackbox night

Overall, one of the best packs, a strong 8.5 out of 10"
the+jackbox+party+pack+7,Recommended,16.0,"Posted: October 18, 2020
The feature where it reads out the room code is groundbreaking. 10/10
Also all the games are great. Best Party Pack yet.

You get 5 great games:

-Quiplash 3
Quiplash but three.


Game where you swipe and tap and wait and scream at your friends because they are selfish and not helping you find the pepper in the kitchen.


Draw a fighter then draw another fighter and have them battle in strange categories.


Talk about a topic whilst someone picks strange stock images for you to use in your presentation.


Stressful guessing game where you can only give vague prompts to help out.

Overall a very enjoyable collection. Would 100% recommend."

Best pack by far.

Played through all of the games with a discord server full of friends for 2+ hours. Each game made us laugh and was worth the time playing.

Quiplash 3: It's Quiplash. All you need to know. Clay animations replacing the usual in-game patterns was really nice.

The Devils and The Details: Probably the most hilarious experience of the night. Everyone screaming at each other to stop throwing the game, the satisfaction of actually winning, etc hits different. Absolutely love it.

Champ'dUP: TKO-2. Fun to be had by all when you know people are going to draw bodily things which go up against other bodily drawings. Characters, music, nice to look at UI makes the game work well.

Talking Points: [IMPORTANT] Streamers, this is the odd-game out if you are playing alone with an audience on twitch or youtube as talking is basically required. However, when played with friends in a voice chat hilarity ensures. I got to start off on the first game first round and the moment it became awkward everyone got a good laugh. Probably my 2nd favorite game in the pack.

Blather Round: The 6 player max kind of had me concerned when initially clicking play... The actual gameplay made it worth it, as once you get going it'll either be really hard or easy to win. Either way everyone gets to have fun with each other.
-Bonus Points for text to speech (Might be bad for streamers but made it even better for us).

You know how with every Jackbox pack, there's at least one game that you're not a very big fan of? Pack 7 isn't like that. On top of having some of the most fun and chaotic games of any Jackbox in the form of Talking Points, The Devil's in the Details, and Champ'd Up, there's not a single game in here that me and my friends actively dislike or find boring - Quiplash and Blather Round are both incredibly solid as well.

My tier list of these games:

Champed up
Has awesome art and music. Having your drawing fight for a title is really fun and everyone I've played this game with has enjoyed it a lot. I can see why people would buy this pack for this game. Always ends with us laughing together over prompts and drawings.

Talking Points
This game is super fun when you're playing with the right people. I'd recommend this for people irl with their friends, but it can still be streamed with strangers. The style of this game is awesome and its so fun to look at. You get to improvise a presentation, if you get embarrassed easily this may not be the game for you, but with the right people it's genuinely so much fun. And I LOVE the way you vote in the game.

QuipLash 3
A fan favorite among Jackbox fans, I don't like quiplash as much but I can understand entirely why people love it. I love the clay animation in this game, it looks awesome and the music is fun.

Devils and the details
Best played irl, otherwise it'll be even more stressful than it already is. It can get pretty chaotic with everyone yelling at each other but people I've played it with still enjoy it. Working together to complete chores is a silly yet fun idea. The art is cute but it's a pretty hard game. I still like it!

Blather Round
Least played game in the box. It's a pop culture guessing game which is a fun idea but not played as much as some of the others in this pack. May fall flat compared to some of the others but this can be pretty entertaining."

++ Quiplash 3 (The best version of quiplash, Jackbox's flagship title)

~ Talking Points (giving presentations on user generated topics is fun but tiring)
~ Champ'd Up (decent drawing game for those good at art, but gets old if you all suck at drawing)
~ Blather Round (Jackbox's attempt at Akinator is okay, but oftentimes players can't guess the answer as the clues are too vague)

- The Devils in the Details (not much other than watching the screen and tapping your phone)

Whilst all the other games are worth a try but pretty mediocre, this pack is worth it alone for Quiplash 3. It solves the issue of its predecessor sometimes having a very lackluster final round and I can't stop coming back to it, it's just too good."
the+jackbox+party+pack+7,Recommended,52.6,"Posted: October 15, 2020
Word Spud.
Lie Swatter.
Civic Dodole.
Zeeple Dome.
Joke Boat.

They've been waiting for a year for their new member.
They will have to keep waiting.
There are no bad games here.

Champ'd Up is a real treat for people who love to draw, and even people that only draw black and white stick figures can join in and stand a chance. So much unintentional humour - and a lot of fun to be had by trying for some humour if you can guess your opponent's prompt and make a deconstruction of it. You get to keep your drawings for the next game if you play with the same players, too! Compared to Tee K.O., it feels like a better flow because you draw two things at a time and every drawing is used at least once, possibly more because there's four drawings and six rounds per person (and again, they can be used in the next game.) Also includes the best part of Bracketeering with none of its bad.

Blather 'Round is like Taboo with less control, and hilarity when someone guesses Oedipus off of ""They are tragic; They feel the mommy."" Or a rush to type Atlantis after the hint is ""it's a not tall liquid civilization.""

Devils and the Details is designed to make people talk over each-other and get frantic. I need more time with this one to say much about it.

Talking Points is a chill game where people probably don't care about the points. It can be cute and/or wholesome. It has a ""free mode,"" but I don't see why you'd want it unless you use it to make custom restrictions.

Quiplash is Quiplash."

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
[[[[[[[=> UPDATED REVIEW 31.12.17 <=]]]]]]]]

I Rate this 8/10 [Maybe Bad Grammar xD]
What i like about the Game

> Smooth and Funny Animations
> Nice Graphics for a game like this (Fits good)
> Really Funny (Small Mechanic bugs makes it even more funnier)
> Good Game Mechanics
> Up to 8 Players per Match
> 17 Multiplayer maps
> 4 Gamemodes including: (Waves, Gang, All vs All and Soccer)
> Many cosmetic Items that you can apply to your Character

What I dont like about the Game:

> No Option to Play private with your Friends
> Matchmaking doesnt work sometimes
> 0.5 Seconds Input lag (character reacts pretty slow according to your reactions)
> The Main menu Overlay needs some improvements
> Needs better key implementation for keyboard, Mouse in Options (Looks kinda unfinished)

What could be added to make it more Enjoyable

> A Round Timer (so people cant troll anymore)
> Needs Workshop (For users to make Custom Maps or Costumes)
> Maybe some other Gamemodes (Highest Climb, Deathrun)

Deathrun explained: In Deathrun you could make it from 1 Point to the other end, in the middle are some traps or some floorplates that will fall apart when running on it, so you basicly have to climb, jump and run across the map. The first to reach the end will win.


Highest Climb explained: In Highest Climb you have to climb to the top of the tower, building...
the first to reach the top wins, you have to keep moving while climbing or you will fall down, some objects will fall slowly during the climbing phase to make it more enjoyable. You can also beat your oponents while climbing.

I've been following Gang Beasts since around 2013 when it was just a twinkle in the eye of a couple of friends on IndieDB, even before the pre-alpha.

Since then this game has seen many transitions, even stepping backwards many times in the gameplay department but never lost it's touch. That is, until they decided to develop a PS4 version as well and then replace the PC version with it. Since then, the game has gone MAJORLY down hill. It's lost almost all of it's charm, by that I mean the way it USED to play. You could do a lot of stupid and silly things, I don't think Gang Beasts was ever meant to be a fighter but more so a silly brawler. By tightening up the controls and trying to make the game better they've made it worse in many ways. They also introduced a stamina system a while back that contributed to me not wanting to play it simply because there was no TOGGLE for it. Sometimes I just wanted to climb the stages for fun without some stamina limitation in my way. They also removed a lot of the ""bugs"" which weren't really bugs but more so just stupid things that made the game a little more fun.

They've tried to make the fighting more streamlined but they've honestly made it worse, the character controls are still clunky but the character tries to respond quicker to your inputs which leads to a lot of frustration, they also changed the grab scheme too, now you can't even reach up high to grab, you can only reach waist height, climbing while faster now feels worse thanks to some of the mentioned issues. You also cannot grab someone and jump now, they'll automatically let go and I have no idea why they did this, it's stupid and just removes yet another bit of charm the game had. The game has always looked decent but with the PS4 patch they tried to make it look nicer and instead of doing that they killed performance completely. Gang Beasts was always kind of heavy on the system for no reason but the PS4 patch shot it through the roof. The menu is also still very clunky, the only positive out of all of this is the updated costume customizer, that's it and even then, the jelly dudes look worse than they did before some how.

The game's biggest problem is the gameplay/controls, since trying to ""fix"" them they've completely broken what was fun about this game. They tried to make it more skill based but it didn't work at all, often times now my hits don't connect at all and I'm seemingly always being one punch KO'd by AI instantly, you can't sprint and then jump anymore like you could before, kicking barely works, the dive kick is fairly useless considering how low you jump, the head butt now leads to more self KO's than anything so it's also mostly useless and grabbing is just awful, your character will grab everything but the thing/person you're trying to grab, it was a little tricky pre-PS4 patch but now it's just absolutely God awful. Devs also talked about moving the game into a more general direction back before it was picked up by a publisher, they talked about doing a lot of the things that Human Fall Flat has done, races/obstacle courses and big open spaces, but they seem to have completely dropped this aspect of the game.

So yeah, almost everything that made Gang beasts feel like Gang Beasts is now gone. I hardly enjoyed the last few hours I've put into Gang Beasts since the PS4 update. It just doesn't feel good or feel like the game I originally paid for. I HATE giving negative reviews, I can usually find a good reason to give a positive review but ultimately, Gang Beasts has let me down hard specially for being such a hugely loyal fan for so many years. I expected a lot more."

This game was absolutely amazing when I first played it over a year ago. I really feel like the blend of glitchy physics and simplistic gameplay on levels breakable in ways that shouldn't have been possible absolutely captured lightning in a bottle.

Since then, however, I feel every update has been loosening the lid and letting a little bit of that magic slip out to the point where the remaining charm exists solely in the mild amusement from watching increasingly Raving Rabbids / Minions-esque characters slap each other a little bit.

It makes me feel as though Boneloaf had a very specific vision for this game - one that is unfortunately wildly superceded by the earlier releases. Trying to reign in the out of control physics and removing things like Waves and Race mode - tweaking the climbing system and dumbing down the options available to you for game customisation (off the top of my head, infinite grip) has truly killed the fun I had in this game.

This, in combination with wildly simplifying the levels has turned this game into nothing but a reminder of the great fun it used to be. Back in the day, it wasn't uncommon to uppercut someone onto an airvent attached to the ceiling before knocking it down in an attempt to climb up there with them, or dropkick someone across the room into a well-timed sausage-hole. Now, it's unlikely that anything will happen other than two characters wildly flailing until one falls over followed by the survivor dumping the fallen off an edge.

TL;DR: What was once up in the pinnacle of couch competitive games has unfortunately slipped into disappointment.

Would no longer recommend, but it was fun while it lasted."

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Folks, I don't want to repeat a lot of what people have said on here. All I can say is, my 11 year old daughter and I have the most fun playing this game together. We are almost constantly laughing. The constant action and nearness to ""danger"" keep us on the edge of our seats, and we laugh all the way down.

I've seen in on a big screen in front of several hundred people, and I've played it on my home PC. It is just plain fun."

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Since last year, me and my room mates have enjoyed drinking and playing this game together. The last update however, made the game significantly less fun. It was so bad, that we actually put the game down after only fifteen minutes. This is the shortest that we have ever played the game. All in all, the latest update is a very large step backward.

The first of my three biggest complains, is that that knockouts are totally broken. You can't knock people out anymore. If you hear the *crack* sound when you knock someone out, they're back up within a second. This takes all the fun out of watching helplessly as someone clumsily tries to throw you over a railing. It's almost impossible to even throw someone out now in the wrestling ring arena now. The only way we were able to get someone out, was when the game glitched, and the person trying to pick up someone knocked out flew into the air.

The second, is that the climbing mechanics are practically nonexistant. A large portion of the game's appeal to me and my room mates, was trying to grab onto someone climbing a wall, and pulling them off. The new climbing is awful. We used to be able to scale the wall in the train arena to avoid being hit by the train, but you can't even get that high anymore. Even worse, if you try to continue to climb after running out of ""climbing stamina"", you slide back down the wall. On a similar note, it appears that the grip strength has been reduced as well. This has also been very frustrating.

The third issue, is that the lives no longer appear on screen anymore. It turns out that if you hit the back button, you can see them, but that's extremely inconvenient.

As much as it pains me, I can't recommend this game until the developers have either fixed these issues, or rolled back to the previous version. This really is a great game, and the developers have been on top of updating it and adding new levels. I would still reccomend this game, but I hope that this negative vote is enough to get the attention of the developers."

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Gang Beasts is one the best local multiplayer experiences available, no question. I have played this countless hours leading up to this Early Access release and I am thorougly excited about the new features and goofiness that awaits.

There is something incredibly appealing about watching plasticine-looking somewhat drunk people punch each other in the face and throw each other into dangerous situations.

If you're having some friends over for a gathering, grab some controllers and play this gem. I have not heard this much screaming since the original Smash Brothers.

We will continue to make this our end of week game in our studio, good job Boneloaf. All the best. Looking forward to every moment that Gang Beasts has to offer.

*EDIT To clarify my 'countless hours' into the game. There has been an earlier copy available for months that I have been playing obsessively with work mates and friends. The Steam copy has lots of new features and tweaks that make it far superior to the old 0.0.1 - 0.0.3 version that were previously available."

It's arguably fun with a group of friends but it's 20€ for a game that's been in early access for 3 years with barely any meaningful updates or new content.

Also I feel like a lot of the development has been focused on remaking stuff that isn't broken and ending up making it worse or just not doing anything in general that would make the game more of a finished product.

The physics are what makes the game fun, but the mechanics are not - the most effective way to play seems to smash every attack button until you knock out another player, then you have like two seconds to pick them up and throw them which usually isn't enough time. Climbing feels inconsistent.


It feels like the devs made a cool tech demo but have no idea what to do with it."

I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

Things you'll need to enjoy Gang Beasts:

- Friends - preferably the RL kind.
- A couch - or a piece of carpeted ground.
- Controllers - 2-8 for the local play.
- Beer - or any other bottled alcoholic beverage.
- A score to settle - have you got a friend you've always dreamt about throwing into an oncoming train? Really? WTF is wrong with you?!

A Seriously fun game that does what is says on the box; let's you control brightly coloured sack-people who fight like limp armed children, what's not to love?

The only real downside is the rather steep cost for an early access game with fairly limited content, although I’d still recommend it if you have the extra cash and friends.

Here's an arbitrary score for you: 8/10"

Its a fun multiplayer game, but it gets more buggy and worse for each update that comes maybe every 6 months or so? Its not at all worth the asking price, and it seems like a long-term cash grab by the developers. I want this game to be good, or at least better and done, but using 3 years in early access with a ridicoulus asking price for what little this game has to offer make me bitter and angry, because the game itself is REALLY fun (at least with the older, less buggy builds) but the whole ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ thing seems to me like the laziest attempt at making money, because its not big, it doesnt have particularly good graphics, and doesnt have a lot of content, so leave it unless its on sale for 5$, because I have been waiting for this game to get better, but it gets more expensive, more buggy and more frustrating."

This game saved my life.

I am 37.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiralling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids."

Gang Beasts seems to get progressively worse with each update. At first, it was a fun physics-based party game with lots of hilarious moments induced by said physics engine. But then they decided to add online play. Online play sounds like it would be great, but the servers are literally potatoes. I get near a full second delay between pressing a button and my character actually performing the action. Before this wasn't an issue, as you could just go into the server browser and sort by lowest ping. But now, for some stupid reason, they decided to remove the server browser. But it gets worse. Instead of fixing the online lag by actually upgrading their terrible servers, the developers have decided to make the game less intensive on the servers by dumbing down the game's physics and maps. As a result, the game gets less and less fun every time the developers try to ""fix"" the online play. Not to mention that the game is overpriced (Should be $5-$10, not $15.) Please, stop cutting down the game. Actually fix your severs."

I used to play this game for ages with friends and laugh at the crazy/wacky physics that made the game amazing. We would always play over Teamviewer or Parsec because there was no multiplayer at the time. Nowadays even with multiplayer the game is hardly playable. They changed the physics so much to the point of where when you press keys to move they happen a second later and your character feels way too floaty. Your hits don't have the umph they used to have and nothing feels extreme anymore. I wish I could recommend this game but currently I can't."

I can't really recommend it right now, don't know what they did to it but it's like it has been dumbed down. I assume it had something to do with the engine change or whatever it was they did.

I mean, it is still a fun game, it's just a shell of what it used to be. Punching just doesn't feel satisfying anymore. You can no longer control your characters direction with the mouse, I assume that's to compensate for players using a controller, which seems a bit dumb, for lack of a better word. I feel like it was in a better state in the pre-release version.. That was more fun to play anyway. The janky physics and freedom of movement were what made the game so hilariously fun to play, and while a fraction of that is still there I feel like a lot of that is lost in the new updates.

Also, please bring back the server browser - at the moment having to rejoin a game at the end of a round is unbelievably inefficient. You guys had a good foundation in the previous versions, decent server browser, and the game would just continue playing after each round ended on a new map with the same people. It made sense. But this new matchmaking thing you got going on.. it's not good.

After playing a couple hours of the latest version I looked at the recent reviews to see what other players thought. Amongst the many positive reviews I saw a negative one simply saying ""gang beasts is dead"". This quote just about sums up my feelings at this stage. I don't know how they can remedy this without massive overhauls to the game. I can only keep my fingers crossed for the future."
gang+beasts,Not Recommended,74.7,"Posted: February 25, 2019
I bought this game years ago while it was still in early access; the game trailer made it look silly and fun so I thought it would be a good game for me and my son. Let me tell you - I have never laughed so hard playing a game before, nor had I heard my son laugh so much at a game. We would play for hours upon hours. There was the odd game crash because it was in early access, but any other bugs usually just made you laugh more, like your character slowly stretching apart and flying into the air, or getting launched at mach 3 across the map and slamming into the wall. If you had asked me then if you should get this game I would've said yes in a heartbeat, even for $40.00, I'd say buy the game.

They eventually fixed the game crashes and loads of other bugs which was appreciated. However fast forward to now and after multiple new updates the game has improved cosmetically, but the gameplay has gotten much worse. I don't play it anymore and honestly when I come back after a couple months to see if the latest patch has improved things it just makes me sad, because it never does play like it used to and it just reminds me how good this game used to be.

These are the 4 main reasons why I feel it's not the fun game it used to be:

1) Punches simply don't land well anymore.

There was always a bit of luck involved when it comes to who would knock out who, but now you can hit left/right punch over and over and over and have nothing happen, even when you throw some head butts in too.

2) Even if you do finally get a knock out, they're back up within less than a couple seconds.

You have to get successive knockouts in order for the other player to actually stay down for a lengthier amount of time. This might be okay if punching didn't work so poorly now.

3) You used to be able to break out of grapples more reliably.

If someone grabs you, you used to be able to spam jump and after a few jumps you'd break out and leap slightly away from the other player. Now you can spam it all you want but you're usually just going to still be stuck to the other player for as long as they keep holding grab. I suppose this ups the ""silly"" factor since it makes kamikazee type plays more common given that you usually can't get away from someone grabbing you and jumping off the edge, but that gets old quickly when you actually want to try to play to win and not draw.

4) You used to be able to climb pretty much all surfaces very easily. You could grab a wall and spam jump to get all the way to the top.

This would make for hilarious games where you'd be chasing each other to all edges of the map and trying to grab someone's leg to pull them off the wall. I understand they likely changed this to avoid griefing in online matches, but man if they only could've at least kept it allowed in local play.

There are other minor issues but those 4 things I feel are the main reason why this game is not what it used to be. The problem is that if you've never played Gang Beasts before, you could buy the game and still have fun for a bit because it is so wacky, so I can see why this still sometimes gets positive reviews from new players or Youtubers that only play for a couple hours with friends. But if you were to ask those same people after say 10, 20 hours of gameplay, I suspect they would be getting bored with it already. It's really disappointing for someone who's played since the beginning and knows that before there used to be an actual competitive game underneath the wackiness, one that actually played pretty well.

At this point I would guess that the developers have made their money and are focusing on making a new game by now. But if you devs are reading, I would change this review to be positive in a microsecond if you fixed punching, grapple breaks, and just added some game customization options. Let me decide how long knock outs last in my match, how many punches it takes to K.O., how much stamina players get, etc.

I put a lot of hours into this game, here's hoping it goes back to the game it used to be at its peak."

Gang Beast used to be a fun game when it first came out. After a patch, the game isn't fun anymore as all the stuff you used to do before is either taken out or much harder to do. Before the patch, you used to be able to control everything especially how you want your hands to grab things. After the patch, it just auto grab the nearest object. This is especially annoying when it comes to brawling near walls as your hands most of the time grab the wall. Before the good old days, you used to do way more than now. The devs destroyed that fun. I want to recommend this game to others, but after the changes they made over the years. I lost interest in telling people that ""hey, this is a good game you should get it""."

How?

How did you manage to break a perfectly decent game that just needed some minor improvements to a total steaming pile of ♥♥♥♥?

The camera angle is even worse than what it was before, its nearly impossible to get into a match. Either you get an error saying connection could not be made with the server, or people will start randomly losing connection during the match...

Publishing this game to PS4 should be the last ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ thing they should be doing. They need to fix this game before they even attempt to do a PS4 release. Can't even play on half the maps unless you do it in single player, which is stupid. It states you can play them, but doesn't give you the option to select them anywhere.

Do yourself a favor, don't buy this game unless its under $5. It's fun for a while, but the same 5 maps get old after a while, and so does the crappy interface.

Basically what happened was the Devs abandoned this game to release it on PS4 for some reason. After being accused of abandoning this game to release on PS4, they just released a 200MB update of crap that only broke the game more. Nice job devs."

It's tough to be down on Gang Beasts. At heart, it's just very silly entertainment for you and your pals, like the multiplayer games of yesteryear. It's kind of bad, broken even, and it's certainly not going to become a mainstay of anyone's regular gaming catalog. But it does guarantee some laughs with your buddies. Isn't that what gaming was designed to do?"

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Loved it before this most recent patch 0.4.2/0.4.1

This game was the HIGHLIGHT of our parties. We would be screaming at 2am and everything. Im talking about 20-30 nerds all lining up to play this game, this is only played at our parties when everyone is over.

But since this new update came out, we all slowly started hating the game. It drastically changed how the game is played. Now everyone can't stand it due to the fact that they made it literally impossible to knock out each other, games now last 10 mins sometimes just trying to hit each other and the fact that the recovery time is 2 seconds or less. You can't even scale walls now, the climbing has been made ""stupider"" and the movements are just limited. Before we were able to knock each other out and be able to toss and earn that knock out, and even climb on maps like elevators/girders and have epic wall battles. We actually get tired playing the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game now and have to take ""hand stretch breaks"" after mashing the buttons so much because no one stays knocked out or you can't even knock them out. I have no clue wtf the devs were thinking.

They need to create some type of menu that allows people to adjust if how hard the players can hit or some type of knock out timer and climbing factor. The fact that everything is just ""up in the air"" frustrates us especially with how bad the most recent update has been. Everyone can now just grab and sucide, no one is scared to get knocked out because its really hard to knock out people now, so just grab and jump off.

The fact that its also been 2 years and limited maps or not allowing users to create new maps is a bit frustrating as well. I've rather them forget the online crap and just focus on creating more maps/content for what it was really intended and even working on making 8 players easy and not making everyone jump through loops to get that to work. This game is expensive as hell too for $20, and how limited it is?

This is my first review and I never want to do them but this update has literally drove me to write one. I seriously hope they make a menu for more customization in how the knockout/climbing/grappling system works or at least let some of us revert back to the old versions because none of us can stand this new version. No offense but to anyone who thinks this is good currently hasn't been playing since the beginning thats for sure or just one of those ""i saw it on twitch and it look fun, i play it for 1 hr and give it a thumbs up"" reviewers.

If they keep this new style of hard to knock out and weak climbing - I wouldn't recommend unless you like ruining your hands and controller mashing for hours.

If they actually change it back or give users option to revert/modify the knockout/climbing/grappling and start adding more ♥♥♥♥ I'll recommend it but other then that I feel like the devs are just lazy and don't pay attention. Its been 2 years, not including its prealpha stages (google it, its been on PC for longer than 2 years...) At least let users crreate ♥♥♥♥ or something if you are gonna give up devs!

PS
We don't want LEGACY, we want the 0.3.x series, that was the best one. Legacy is too old and the joke is..we went back to it and it has a better LAYOUT then currently and even looks better...wtf is that about loll...."

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
I first found this game through a YouTube Let's Play, and it looked really fun.

Well, it is really fun. There's just something so entertaining about being able to pick up your friends after you've punched them unconscious, throwing them around like little ragdolls, and best of all, BREAKING STUFF! You'd be surprised at the stuff you can headbutt into pieces, among them: elevator cables, glass, doors, railings, and much more!

The graphics style is adorable, and it reminds me of those little claymation shows and movies I enjoyed as a child.

Moreover, the control scheme (at least for controllers) is simplistic, and even one of my non-gamer friends got the hang of it immediately!

Replay value? You betcha. Some of the best multiplayer games, in my opinion, are the ones that offer you a simple premise, a few different scenes / characters for when you want to switch it up, and leave you to your own devices. Even if you don't have anyone to play with, one of their builds offered a cool mode where AI-controlled enemies came in waves. Available single- or multi-player!

Speaking of, this game is being worked on all the time. They come out with new builds chock full a' updates more often than I take notice. From bigger things--like more customisable characters and changed menus--to smaller things--like the lighting or details on models on the various maps--it's great getting to see this game progress as time goes on. And honestly, I think it can only get better from here.

Yes, it is ""Early Access"", but this plays better than the majority of Early Access Games I've experienced. Is it worth $20 yet? Maybe, it really depends on how much you think you'd get out of it (it's definitely its funniest with other people, so if you're more of a lone-wolf kinda gamer, maybe this isn't for you, at the price, just yet...maybe look for it to be on sale on Humble Bundle like I did).

I've experienced just a few glitches, but they're certainly not game-breaking; in fact, they enhance the game! I mean, how can you not laugh when your character breaks every single carriage on the ferris wheel and then is slingshotted into the water? It has an adorable charm to it, and even if it costs me a winning streak, it is a pleasant occasion that I just can't get annoyed at. It's like if your kid pulled a flower from your garden to give you as a present. You still have plenty of other flowers (and plenty of other matches), and it brings a smile to your face. And isn't that what games are here to do? (Most of them, anyway.)

Even though I don't have a whole lot of friends, I've managed to put a solid eight hours into this game already, and by no means am I going to stop there. I wholeheartedly recommend it, and if you're still on the fence, take a gander at some YouTube videos like I did, because they portray very well what the game is like to actually play."

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Good with friends, but lately input delay and glitches have gotten much much worse. It seems every time they update it they break it more than don't do anything about it and leave it

*EDIT SINCE SEPTEMBER UPDATES* The glitches for the most part have left the game, random crashes, audio not working, audio not turning off, audio BLARING for no reason, etc. and the multiplayer has gotten much better. Instead of playing a map 3 times it goes first to four on different maps which is nice, elevator spawns have been fixed to all spawning on bottom for nice balance, and the input lag feels like it has been halved. On the other hand some mechanics still need tweaking - some people who I can punch for 20 seconds will not go down but I will go down in one hit, and I will go down for 10 seconds even when tapping a (if that's even still a feature) yet other people will go down for a little bit. But that's really my only complaint, if it's me I have no idea what it could be. Gameplay is much better and smoother, the UI is better and smoother, the audio options actually work, there's much less phasing through stuff and dying randomly, and the new maps are pretty cool too."

Up unti lthe last patch, the game had some glitches, but was fun to play on local co-op. Some changes were made, and now it is difficult to knock someone out, and when they are knocked out, they regain consciousness so quickly that it is almost impossible to lift and drop them.

In it's current state, playing a 4-Player Local co-op has lost its appeal. The number of lives remaining is no longer shown on screen, and each round takes much too long due to the 'knock out' changes.

I will change my vote to 'recommended' again if the mechanics are fixed or adjusted for the better."

This game used to be a blast to play. My friends and I would stay up all night playing this during early access. It seem that every patch the developers completly screw up game balance and manage to make the game even more broken than before. Because of the party style gameplay the balance of the game isn't as important to me as fixing the menu and controller bugs. I have had trouble getting controllers working on the game and 8 player never seems to work anymore. If this game becomes remotely playable I will update my review. I do not recomend this game in its current state which is a shame because the gameplay is silly, fast paced, and fun. The way the charecters flop around when they fight and the odd stage locations always manages to make me laugh.

Side Note: Run and jump are bound to the same button on the controller and there is no way to change it. This means that when you want to run you have to hold down the button and to jump you let go of the button. So that when you want to stop running you have to jump. Also to jump you have to push the button and then let go of it which takes much longer and can be very frustrating when trying to make more difficult jumps. They have left-over ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on the controller and in the legacy version of the game the controls weren't set up like this."

3 years of early access to create a game where little jelly men punch eachother across a tiny variety of thread-bare arenas and somehow it's worse than ever.

Why does it run ♥♥♥♥♥♥ now?

Why can't I select my native res now?

Why does the knockout punch seem more arbitrary than ever now?

Why does my sombrero get stuck at the beginning of every round and then tear across the screen, creating an ugly blur of brown wherever I go?

Why have the physics been altered as to create less funny moments?

Why is the camera pulled in so close that I have no idea what is happening in the fight outside my very immediate vicinity?

Why is this significantly worse than previous builds and why the ♥♥♥♥ are you now calling it finished?

Why is there still only a handful of maps when they clearly aren't difficult to make?

Why are you so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ lazy!!!?

This game would benefit HUGELY from adding VR support.

I want to start this review by saying THIS GAME DESPERATELY NEEDS VR SUPPORT.

This game is so detailed and so perfect for VR and motion controllers. I seriously hope the developers add VR support soon as the VR space is lacking a cooking game as detailed and enjoyable as this game. This game could be the flagship cooking game for virtual reality.

----------------------------------------

Initially when you first load into the game it comes across as a little overwhelming but I encourage you to give it a chance and at least play for a couple of hours before you make your judgement.

I advise you place your spices and chopping boards under the TV monitor opposite the oven. This way you can quickly glance up at the TV screen to see how much of each spice you need to season your ingredients with. It may seem like a lot at first but once you get into the flow of things and start memorising the recipe you'll be fine.


- Lots of recipes
- Physics are acceptable for this game
- Graphics are great
- Difficulty Progress is great
- Plenty of funny moments


- Controls are a little janky: Takes a little while to get used to the controls and they are a little difficult to use sometimes. Another reason why VR would be bloody perfect for this game. Natural interaction with your hands would make this game even more fun.

- Weird sluggish mouse? Even with the latest mouse smoothing changes the mouse still feels not as responsive as I would like. It also feels like VSYNC is forced on despite being turned off.


This game really is very fun. Played 8 hours already and I've only owned it 2 days. If you're a fan of cooking or simulator it's definitely worth checking out."

I really like the idea of this game. I like this game... but... man there are a lot of issues here. I will, likely, keep playing the game and really hope they improve things and maybe even take some of my suggestions below, but in this state, I cannot recommend this game to anyone else, and I'm pretty shocked it has a ""Mostly Positive"" rating right now. This isn't early access anymore...

Let's break it all down:

Pouring

Pouring things into other things is cumbersome. Finally have gotten used to pouring soup from a pot into a bowl and getting close to 300ml, but would MUCH rather use a ladle, even if it was 50ml at a time; it's more realistic and much easier to control (unless I have to aim and tilt; just give me a ""pour into thing"" option). Also, there's no aiming help when pouring from a pot or other similar items (like there is for purchased liquids), and on a flat screen, the lack of depth perception really hurts this (more on that in cutting later).

With the pots, however, at least you can see the liquid level, so it's not too hard to tell where the start of the pouring is. The bottles and cartons, however, are totally different. Because it's so difficult to stop the pour at the right moment, you want to have low volume things pouring slowly, and to do that you have to very slowly move the mouse until it starts to pour. If you could see the level, then it would be easier to tell when it was going to start.

What I'd REALLY much rather have is the interface like the sink for all pouring situations (and the ladle idea above). Push button to start pouring, push it again to stop, done. There's enough other challenge that the current mechanic is just annoying.



Flipping food is a nightmare. Once you have the item on/in your utensil, you have to hold down shift, carefully maneuver the utensil forward, left/right, and down (but not too far or your pan will disappear into the stove and throw everything else in it, on the floor), then hold down the right-mouse button (still holding shift), and carefully move your mouse sideways to turn the item over. If you let your mouse go forward or backward at all it might crash into the pan and (again) cause it to disappear and throw it's contents on the floor. Then, assuming you did all that correct, you either release or drop it, and have to be careful where your utensil ends up because it might run into something and... cause your pan to disappear into the stove (worst case) or fling something to the other side of the kitchen.

Leaving the spatula and tongs as they are would be okay (well the tongs anyway) if, at least, you couldn't accidentally push them into the pan or other objects and cause them to go flying, or really move at all.



Cutting seems simple enough... put think on cutting board, grab knife, focus cutting board, align the line where you want to cut, and cut. Easy. The issue is, however, you can't really look around once you have your line where you want it, so getting perfect cuts is incredibly difficult for something that even a new cook could do more easily. In real you build up muscle memory and can improve on this, but here, it never gets any better. Sure, you can add a perk to slow down time, and you can add a perk to keep the food from moving, but that's only minimally helpful. Maybe a perk that eventually lets you cut things into even parts (you pick how many) automatically? Not sure... I don't want to take away all the feeling of getting in there with your hands, but the current implementation is just irritating.



Again, more awkward controls. If you want to just put stuff on a plate, easy, hold plate, click each thing, boom. If you want to arrange things, however, putting them in a particular place requires using the cumbersome shift mechanic, which I'm sure I will get faster at, but it will always be an un-enjoyable mechanic.

Maybe better would be something like, hold down the right-mouse button, and then use WASD to position, QE to rotate, and just snap the Z to be above whatever is there (i.e. if you move a potato (with WASD) over another potato on a cutting board, the moving potato would just pop to right above the placed potato, and when you move off to only be over the cutting board, then it snaps down to just above the cutting board.



Similar to moving stuff, the mouse is a major detractor in this game. First thing that helped a lot was to turn off the mouse easing or whatever that setting was. The second is to turn the sensitivity almost all the way down (even on my gaming mouse that I can adjust on the fly, at its lowest setting still needed the game turned down). Other interfaces, however, still move way too fast or strange. The little mini-screen that appears when you deliver the food, for example, is crazy hard to control, which can really irritate you if you have just seconds left to deliver a dish.

If you're going to base nearly EVERYTHING on mouse movement, then that mouse control needs to be dead-to-rights perfect; this game's mouse implementation is rough, at best. Tune the sensitivity better, and even it out across all interfaces, it shouldn't suddenly be faster in one area than another, unless you're going to allow for separate controls for each movement type's sensitivity.



Would MUCH prefer this felt like a menu I maintained for the restaurant, rather than just a series of unlocks. If a real restaurant found that a recipe was not meshing well (from a productivity perspective) they could drop it from the menu, but I can't do that.

Also, I was hoping to be able to create a new recipe and add it to the menu, rather than just picking from a catalog. That would help it feel more realistic too.



While there are ""sticky notes"" all over, and a tutorial, nothing really teaches you the mechanics. For example, it took a long time to figure out that 300g of potatoes, which require 6g of salt, should have 3g of salt put on each potato you cut them or you will forever get ""too much salt"" or ""not enough salt"" critiques.

What does it mean when there's a red border around an item, after the green bar fills up, but before the red bar starts? I assume it means it is at risk for burning, but nothing in the game ever talks about it (unless I've missed it).



If boiled potatoes should have 20g of salt, then adding that salt after the potatoes are in the water should be fine, but if you get the salt on the potato instead of the water then you get marked down. In real, you could just as easily add the salt after the potatoes...

How many people, in real life, have opened an oven door into their plate and ended up shattering said plate all over the floor? I'm willing to bet significantly fewer people than the number of plates I've broken, in this game, at the oven.

Speaking of broken plates... where's the broom and pan? Pick up one shard, throw away one shard, pick up another shard, throw away another shard, repeat about 8 times... ugh...

An oven at 93% looks like it's crazy unhygienic. It took a while of rubbing 'wear' marks with a sponge to realize what that was. Rather than a progression of wear that shows visibly like that, why not have a progression that increases the chance of it breaking (can be reduced with regular maintenance), but doesn't necessarily show on the outside. Just know that the last time you had it maintained or fixed was x days ago or whatever.

You can't fit a pan in front of a pot on the stove. This annoys me to no end because I like to keep my soups on the back burners, and use the front burners for active cooking. Instead, I can only use either two burners for soups, and two burners for pans, leaving two back-burners unused.

Again... I really like the game, but it seriously frustrates me, and because of that, I cannot recommend it."

Cooking Simulator is a groundbreaking simulator including a campaign and a sandbox mode. Such a complete pantry and kitchen with ovens and inflammable, explosive materials... don't try this at home!

Dialogues are limited to tutorial and guidelines.
There is no actual plot to the game.


– You are here forever!
This gamemode is where the player faces the challenges.

During the campaign each day is divided into three phases, starting with the preparation. It's supposed to be dedicated to replacing and preparing ingredients. Some things, like dishes and veggies, can be accessed immediately from the pantry and there is no need to worry about them. More advanced equipment and items such as spices or liquids must be bought from the boxes that act as stores, with their own selection menu. As this process might be quite time consuming, it is advisable to take care of it during this period.

At the beginning everyday there are around 5 orders to complete throughout the day. The recipes are quite faithful to the reality ingredients wise, but obviously cooking times have been reduced for the game.
There are various cooking stations, such as the basic stove, ovens, food blender and fryers together with just the right amount of tool types. Cooking stations are limited to those already placed in the kitchen, but additional tools can be bought at any time from the box. The stations have their durability and after some usage they need to be repaired. This consumes some time and money, but thankfully they don't break often and some perks can help to minimize the encumbrance.
Each food order is displayed on the screens at the center kitchen island and provides the recipe, as well as the time left to complete it. Some operations required for the preparations of the dishes are to cut, cover with spices, boil, fry bake or simply assemble the ingredients. As the game progresses new recipes are unlocked. Every serving is judged based on the ingredients coherency and cooking technique following those on the recipe, if a dish is not plated correctly, it won't be accepted.

After the serving phase, comes the cleaning one. It can be used to empty the pans and pots, rearrange the spices, clean up the kitchen with a sponge and a floor mop, throw away the garbage. It can also serve as an extension of the preparation phase.
Each day concludes with an experience, fame and money summary. Experience levels are used to gain useful skills and one a few levels, some perks as well. When the restaurant is finally ready to advance to the next fame stage, a culinary critic judges a serving of food. If the test is successful it increases substiantially the fame level and allows to advance to a further level, giving the player a small trophy as well. The highter the fame level, the more difficult the gameplay gets, incrementing order quantity during a working day.


- The kitchen is on fire!

In opposition to the campaign mode, in which recipes and ingredients unlock gradually, here the player is provided with every single item available in the game, as well as infinite money. Seeing all those ingredients is truly inspiring and allows a real cooking creative freedom. The dishes in here can't be judged unless the player selects a recipe to follow and serve.

As there is no pressure at all, this mode allows an advanced game exploration, with more hazardous activities.
Encouraged by a dart target-shield, the player can engage in some knife throwing. A sticky note on the oven suggests the most brilliant idea in the game - “I won't ever put a flame extinguisher in the oven!” is what it says, but the fryer works just as fine! If the boxes accidentally end up on the open stove fire, they will burn and cause a magnificent reaction with the gas canisters placed all over the kitchen, setting the floor ablaze– which will cause the fire supression system to activate. It wouldn't be a true simulator, without the windows, screens and AC units breaking as well – just what is needed for the level of frustration certain recipes can provide.


The graphics are gorgeous and very detailed, as even on the minumum setting all the food looks realistic outside and inside. Just by looking at it the player can tell what kind of cooking it's been through. The environment is very pleasing and lifelike, too.
Tere is inbuilt a very handy screenshot system, which pauses the game and allows the player to take the screenshot from the best angle and distance possible.

There are several music soundtracks to select from, as well as no music at all. All of them work well as a background noise. Additionally kitchen sounds are very well made and suggest what is happening in the pans, integrating the immersion.

First things first – before buying, be sure your machine is somewhat better than mine, which already satisfies the basic requirements. This game is heavy, as I played on the lowest possible settings and still had some performance issues, including long loading screens and occasional stuttering.

Sometimes collisions do not work as they're supposed to, as it is possible to break some plates when taking them from a specific shelf, if not using some immagination to how to do it safely, ignoring the actual animation. It happened that when I was passing near the fridge, the content of my pan randomly spilled around, too.
The perk for keeping items still when cutting, did not work for me.

Some mechanics are overly complicated and time consuming, such as setting up a timer requiring way too many steps. Fetching spilled items one by one is very frustrating, as it consists in selecting the item and then waiting as they end up in the pan, misclicking would cause the pan to be put on the surface and is overall very obnoxious and mentally tiring. Pots can be emptied in the trash and not in the sink – not intuitive at all! Also rotation mechanics are very upsetting, as the items not always spill as they're supposed to, sometimes falling around or sticking to the surface.



Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-7500U CPU 2.70GHz 2.90 Ghz
8 GB RAM
NVIDIA GeForce 950M

It offers a challenging campaign and an infinitely entertaining sandbox that sets no real time limit or game completion. This simulator can really be used for some cooking brainstorming and experiments, without spending additional money, which in my opinion is an excellent point. The price is very good for what the player gets."

Quite a lot of fun.

Pros
- Physics are brilliant
- Cooking Mechanics are fun
- A lot of variety

Cons
- Plating Dishes is a real problem, there is no real way to lay out food items on a plate which is a bit disappointing, hard to present a quality looking dish.
- Some physics glitches but that is expected day one

Worth your time and money, the devs are very active, friendly and happy to take on board suggestions."

Alright, hear me out on this. The game is really fun and I like it. It's nice and covers the ""cooking simulator"" theme really well. You own a virtual kitchen, complete requests and everything's fine as long as you do not run into any bugs. Sadly, there is A LOT of bugs.

I do not want to sound rude but I am really dissapointed by the fact that instead of focusing on improving the optimization and smooth gameplay the devs would rather focus on releasing new DLCs that are more likely to contain the same annoying bugs and glitches from the base game.
If you do not mind your items glitching into the textures and disappearing, fridge/oven's door getting stuck, really wonky physics (although I guess this is to be expected from ""simulator"" titles), some bugged recipies that need 100% pixel perfect cooking time or amount of ingredients, unstable fps and stuttering, etc. then I guess you are free to enjoy the game to your heart's content.

Nevertheless it is still a fun game, just needs a bit of improving rather than new content which is not that necessary or so I believe. In the end but I wish the aforementioned bugs and issues were addressed better."

BUYER BEWARE - Recommended game, but I have a lot to criticize.
_______________________________________________________________________

There is a reason why VR would drastically improve this game's user experience, and my review will attempt to explain to you why.

There aren't many cooking simulators out there; this is probably one of the best you could get. Despite my recommendation, however, I have to say that the game doesn't feel great.

There are a couple of issues with Cooking Simulator's core system:

1. Janky movement: The player simply moves too much and too quickly through their WASD movements and crouch controls. This will often lead to ingredients falling off of the player's plate/pot/container very easily, often requiring you to pick them up from the surface the item dropped on. While there are no penalty points for food sanitation, this can be annoying at its best, and immersion-breaking at its worst.

1.5 Violent physics: Combined with the awkward movement system, some items have the tendency to break. Sometimes you might be standing in front of a fridge with a plate. Opening the fridge when you're too close could potentially push the plate off-screen, causing it to collide with a nearby wall and spilling all of its contents.

2. Awkward positioning system: This is both a blessing and a curse. The game has a system in which you can place certain items on top of others--such as a bunch of onions onto the cutting board, or a bun on a plate. Normally, this wouldn't be an issue, but the game only allows the player to place these items on the center of the container's surface. This means that if I want five pieces of steak on my cutting board, they would be stacked on top of each other by default until I meticulously push them out of the way or moving them with an additional cooking utensil. This can be very annoying late-game, as it makes meal prepping a lot more time-consuming (unless you use one cutting board for one dish's single ingredient, which will take up a lot of space in the end).

[EDIT: I have been told that there is a workaround for the centering issue. For those who wish to collect multiple items without stacking, you can move your mouse or body before the item falls onto your container so that it would land in a different position. While this tip is incredibly helpful, the player should be careful due to the fact that there is a lack of a proper weight/friction system in the game--there is a strong possibility that your distributed items would slide off your container if you move too hastily.]

3. Lack of proper portion control: The game has a decent collection system, where you can put multiple objects into your container. Say that you diced your onions into tiny 5 gram bits. You can, by default, scroll your mouse wheel to highlight all of the onion bits and transfer them together onto your plate. This can be very useful for large dishes such as pumpkin soup, as you need a lot of pumpkin to make a single pot. Unfortunately, the game doesn't give you the option to fine-tune the amount, so if you want to cook a pot of penne and split them into two portions, you usually will end up with one portion significantly larger than the other.

Also, when you combine this issue with the awkward positioning system, you will often have ingredients falling off your container, since they often stack on top of each other and fall off.

4. Limited mouse controls: This is one of the biggest issues that plagues the game's cooking experience. The devs wanted to make a cooking game where the player has all the control; however, they decided to design this game for the Keyboard and Mouse. This means that when you're using the spatula to flip something, or if you're using a knife to cut something, you're going to be using the mouse to perform the task. It's definitely doable, and it can be pretty easy once you're experienced, but it just feels incredibly awkward when you look at your spatula spin along the Z axis slowly just to drop your fillet so that it falls on the other side onto your pan.

[EDIT: I realize that using a knife is actually the bigger issue for me and I totally forgot to mention that, so here are two paragraphs describing the cutting experience.]

Using a kitchen knife is pretty much identical to being crippled. Since you can't really move your mouse up and down to cut like an actual knife, you actually use the left mouse button and the knife will move down to cut whatever that's underneath. Since you can't really rotate your mouse to cut in different angles, the game wants you to rotate the knife via WASD for you to get the angle you want. All this feels... incredibly slow and awkward. In many ways, it really feels like you're cooking with only one arm.

What sucks the most is that you can't really move the ingredients around the board with your knife to cut things into sizes you want. Say that I need to cut a piece of salmon into 25g chunks. I can easily cut fish through a grid style format, but I cannot cut the fish sideways unless the chunks of meat fall over sideways. This means that I usually have to cut my salmon into fish fries to get the appropriate size for my chunks.

When you take a look at all these issues, you can see that many of these problems stem from the controls themselves--WASD movement are too dynamic, which cause collision issues; the positioning system isn't efficient, because you use the mouse to both hold the container and collect items, which is why everything is forced to be collected at the center of the container; the mouse controls are awkward because the player is supposed to simulate 3D movement on a 2D plane.

I understand that the devs want to get into VR when they're sure that there's enough demand for it, but I see it more as a way to improve the design of the game. Unlike many other game genres, a game revolved around actual cooking is one that takes finesse, and this game doesn't really have that yet."

I've never written a review on Steam in my life. But I'm writing one now, for this game. That's how much I've truly enjoyed it and continue to do so.

Truly a strong entry into the culinary simulation niche side of gaming but not without some minor weaknesses. Potential is rich in the game and the content is sweet and savory and… Oh, sorry – I was a getting bit carried away. In all seriousness, this game has room to grow and will easily stand the test of time as one of the most memorable cooking sims of all time.

Strengths:
- Selection of dishes to create is quite large at the start and are all achievable in another game titled “The Real World”, haven’t played that one yet.
- All prep work, cooking and plating all feel realistic in terms of time and effort, nothing is cheesy or out of place and every aspect requires involvement.
- The look and feel of the kitchen, ingredients and tools are vibrant, modernized and up-to-snuff in terms of the current era in gaming graphics.
- Spending extra time and effort in a creation makes a massive impact on whether you get a decent payout, i.e. wildly chopping a lemon into odd and unequal pieces and not garnishing the dish properly will notch you a star rating or two and put you at risk for failing to impress a food critic which sets you back exponentially.
- Customizing your kitchen and setting it up to your style is limitless. You’re not tied to only having 2 pots, you can have 6 if you want. Want more frying pans? You can buy 10. Want to buy 50 gallons of sour cream? Done. You can easily arrange items for ease of access and redundancy and truly rock the kitchen.
- The Sandbox mode is truly a well-designed playground in which you can initiate food orders at a PC and follow along the steps in order to create the dish at your own pace. Practice juggling multiple orders and finding your groove in a safe environment so long as you don’t set the whole place on fire ;)
All in all, it’s truly a fun game with massive potential and has a lot going for it currently. There are a few things that stick out to me like a sore thumb currently.


- Collision issues. I.e. cut pieces of potato fall through the wire of a deep fryer basket at a large rate. Attempting to cut pieces on a cutting board will wedge the piece beneath the board and the countertop. Moving with a blender moderately full of produce can send some items across the kitchen, etc.
- Frame rate gradually dropping as the days go by (19 currently). Some tasks cause massive plummets, i.e. pouring contents from a pot to a bowel, using/seasoning with the “Thyme” herb, when an order comes in and appears on screen.
- The “career mode” literally feels like a survival/endurance mode. I understand there’s a preparation time and a cleaning segment of each day, but I still barely have enough time to arrange, fully stock up and organize my kitchen. Also, the only feeling of proprietorship of the restaurant you have is changing the cosmetics of the kitchen, i.e. walls, floors and ceiling and purchasing recipes once you have enough fame and points.
- Pouring contents from a pot to a bowl/deep plate is cringeworthy without a ladle. Why not use one you ask? Well, there isn’t one… That’s why…
- Another thing about liquids, perhaps implement the ability to use the scroll wheel of the mouse to adjust the amount of liquid you’d like to end up in destination? For example, I pick up my bottle of “Olive Oil”, I use the scroll wheel and roll it upwards to increase the milliliters I’d like to have end up in my pan, and then pour. Same could be arrange for a pot to a bowl. An idea folks.
- Co-Op mode. Cause nothing says culinary genius than having a friend to blame for why the pasta was overcooked!
I can see lots of work is already been accomplished in just the matter of days and even just hours with patches and the efforts in connecting with the community. If they keep this up and truly support the two-way communication they desire with their player base, this title will make other sims pale in comparison as the development begins to thrive with the support of both developers and the relationship with the consumers working in tandem."

Iron Chef: PC

Cooking Simulator is a, well it’s a cooking simulator. In the career mode, you take on the role of head chef in a restaurant that’s not doing particularly well. It’s your job to return the restaurant to its former glory, by serving high quality dishes and earning yourself fame. Reaching certain fame milestones will bring a food critic to your restaurant, giving you the chance to increase the restaurant’s star quality.

I enjoy cooking in real life, and I’ve always enjoyed cooking games (though I can’t think of any 3D cooking games I’ve played) so I was pretty excited to give this a try. While I’ve found my time with it so far to be pretty enjoyable, it can be a pretty frustrating game to play.

Positives:
For the most part, the visuals are pretty decent. It’s nothing mind-blowing but it looks nice enough.

Cooking in the game is enjoyable, and the systems in place to cook the food are good. There’s a noticeable change in color for food that’s being fried, chopped items look like they’re supposed to no matter how you chop them.

Completing recipes earns you experience points, and leveling up lets you unlock new skills and purchase perks. Skills range from giving you the ability to hold food still while you’re chopping it, to seeing the temperature/’doneness’ of a food item in a closed oven. Perks come in three tiers and usually offer a 10%/30%/50% improvement of something such as tip amount per dish or lower ingredient costs.
















Cooking Simulator can be a pretty frustrating experience thanks to clunky controls, no recipe management and other issues, but despite its issues it bafflingly manages to be an enjoyable experience. If you enjoy cooking or are just interested in the cooking game genre, I’d say that this is worth grabbing on sale.

I want to recommend this game. I really do.
Food experimentation is something I usually just think about, and creating wacky, and sometimes just satisfying food dish is one of my dream simulation games in theory... but Cooking Simulator becomes a lifeless slong after barely 3 hours in without DLCs.

Creating dishes is not enjoyable when you take in the fact you have to face against time limitations, hostile physics, and picky evaluation system. If I wanted a messy time-management game, I'd go play Cook Serve Delicious instead.
What I dislike even more about this game is how it limits your creativity by forcing you to create recipes, and unfortunately, experimenting to see how well an original dish went doesn't work (unless you're playing the Cakes & Cookies DLC, which is, personally, how I think this game should have been from the get-go). You're stuck doing literal chores with an awful UI, following the same boring recipes. And that's not even the tip of the iceberg -
Game breaking bugs, Unresponsive support team that ceased development for DLCs that have been released months ago. It's as if the game is dead, and yet, they're now focusing on the VR version, which is most likely going to be equally horrid.

It's clear that whoever made this game had a vision, but they couldn't evolve beyond their nearsightedness and delivered this mostly broken mess for a quick cash-grab.

It's overall a disappointing experience, and one that is not worth paying above 9.99$."

Game displays ads and makes you navigate through a menu of for-sale DLC content to get to the content you actually own.

Bought this ages ago. Tried it. Oh my goodness it was the most unbelievably frustrating game I've ever played, and I wanted to throw the damn computer out of the window 10 minutes into playing. Must have been in an odd mood about a week ago, because I opened it up again just to give it a go... And now I'm addicted. There is a VERY steep learning curve to this game; I was taking 20 minutes just to get some soup on the table. And now I can do it in under 2. Seriously, I really like this game - it's beautiful, challenging, fun, and engaging.

TIP - if you're trying to get a bunch of ingredients from a chopping board/floor into a another container, use the scroll wheel to select more than one item at a time, and they will throw themselves into the bowl/pan. Took me 10 hours to learn that, and it would have saved me so much time."

Picture this, You're about to finish an order and on your way to the door, the fish and chips you created, clips the shelf. What do you do??? Panic. Frantically trying to pick up those pieces of your shattered plate and the food itself. ""The Timer!"" You shout, grasping for the slightest bit of traction as this cooked fish slips through your slim fingers. The timer beeps repeatedly, waiting nay, urging for your touch. As the timer yearns for you, the fish finds you distasteful. The grasp of the potatoes mashes them to shreds, and now you are left on the floor, weak, afraid, and without a meal. As the chef you are, you gather yourself, pick up the pieces, and YOU get another PLATE. Yes, YOU! You get another plate and some tongs, and you pick up that stupid incorrectly made fish and chips, and you serve that garbage to another human being. Sure the taste was rather disgusting, and vile. But the time, was excellent, rounding in at about 2 minutes. You did it. You made fish and chips in 2 minutes. Bone arf it teeth."

Sadly, it just gets painfully boring near the 10th hour.



Watching Let’s Game it Out play this on Youtube, I thought I would love the sandbox experience, and I did! When playing, I tried all manners of different approaches.

I did things chaotically, not caring if there were broken shards of glass in the meal I was serving, frying up my cooking utensils, serving food which I had dropped on the floor three times and blowing up my kitchen devices.
I played professionally, trying to serve up orders as fast as possible with the best quality, getting the restaurant from one star to four stars.
And I also played it the fast food way, using ingredients that I had prepared four days ago, making a gallon of soup and microwaving it for each serving, going for speed over quality and trying to maintain score.
I even streamed my shenanigans to my friends for one night. I did all of that in less than 10 hours, and then I found myself bored and unenthused.


This is a fun game but only for a short time. Cooking is enjoyable, and memorizing recipes is a good challenge, but that’s just it. You’re locked in a kitchen with no interactions with the outside world. All you do is get orders on a monitor, cook them and then serve them into a box and get a score.

There are no NPCs for you to interact with. The closest thing you get is some 2D portrait pop-ups at the top of the screen after each meal and event to blurt out a line you’ve heard a hundred times before.
You don’t even get to see your customers! As mentioned before, whenever you want to serve an order, you place the plate into a box in the wall, its door closes and the game is immediately paused to give you your score on that meal. There are no interactions to be had with anything besides food items.


It would have been nice if you could hire kitchen staff to help you, get to see your customers and have them physically react to your food, even barge into your kitchen to complain. Basically to interact with like a live NPC who isn’t a 2D portrait telling you “good job” for the 20th time in the past hour.
All you do is sit in a static kitchen, doing whatever you were doing the day before and until the end of time with nothing else to do and no one else to interact with. I know I sound like a broken record at this point but that’s because there is almost nothing more to talk about. That’s just it. Whatever you’re seeing in an image or video is exactly what you’re gonna get here. There is no real variety or special events to spice things up. It’s always the same.

To be fair, there are some events like a food critic visiting whose meal score affects the restaurant’s score, but there’s really nothing special or different about it. The only “different” thing is that a 2D portrait pops up on top of the screen to tell you that he’s “important”. He doesn’t ask for any special recipes and isn’t hard to impress either. Serve him crap, like a ⅖ star dish and he’ll still love it give your restaurant a star.

There are other features that try to spice things up and create variety, like skills/perks you can purchase, selecting meals of the day etc. but none of them truly add anything. They just make things easier, like having unbreakable plates, lowering customer expectations, getting more money, a magic wand that cleans the whole kitchen in one click and anything else that feels like cheating and makes it even more boring. Other features like the Meal of the Day affect the game so little that they might as well not be there.

Maybe co-op could have made this more fun and add more value, but sadly, the developers have stated firmly that they will never add it.



Bored of the base game, I tried the and found it to be even worse. Not only is it the same, but now you don’t even have the 2D pop-ups, automatic orders and scores to work with. No, it’s not even a restaurant anymore. You just ring a bell whenever you want to take an order (max five orders at any time) and you deliver them to the aforementioned box with no interactions, time limit or anything. It is so bare-bones and lonely that you actually miss the 2D guys. It feels like you’re playing an imaginary tea-party with yourself.





I can’t really recommend this. It looks fun and it can be, but there are just so many hours that you can play with yourself (pun intended), doing the same thing over and over until you get bored out of your mind. It took nearly 10 hours for me, it might take longer or even less time for you. Either way I expected more from a sandbox.
Maybe if you have VR, you can enjoy it for a little bit longer, but ultimately the lonely, static room I described is all you’re gonna get.

If 10 hours is enough for you, then sure, get it, but if you’re hoping for something to entertain you for a longer period, this isn’t it."

This game has a lot of potential. Unfortunately, it also has a lot of problems, the amount of which make it impossible for me to recommend this to anybody, unless it's a 90% off sale or something. I'm going to make a long rambling list/story/description of all the hassles I have had with this game, the devs (because the experience with the community does actually impact the play experience) and the discord server, which, unfortunately, is a massive part of being able to report bugs (which this game has a lot of. some game breaking.)

Caveat that I play sandbox a lot, because the main stories are just too glitchy, with progress constantly having to be restarted to due game breaking bugs. I also do not have the latest dlc because I refuse to support these devs anymore.

Also, the reason my play time is what it is is because of all the effort I went to to get the game playable, which exceeded the allowable refund time - and it is decently entertaining when it works.

Important information re specs: My rig is an i5 - 9600k, GTX 2060 super with 8gb VRAM, 16gb ram. Desktop. So I more than meet the system requirements. I do honestly believe that if you are trying to play this game with a system that is under the minimum, then yeah, you're gonna have bugs. My point of contention here comes with the recommended requirements. Namely...what are they? Because they certainly aren't the ones listed on the steam store page. When I first bought this game, I would get constant BSOD Machine Check Exceptions about 20 to 30 minutes into gameplay no matter what mode I was in. That I can kind of let slide, because it turned out to be user error on my part, sort of. (It was a unity thing and I had to up my CPU vcore to fix it.) But it's a great example that this game is not optimized well at all. I get low fps on any settings, despite exceeding the hardware requirements. it always feels very laggy and it makes my fans sound like a jet engine. (the only solution i have found to this was from the discord where a user suggested turning vsync OFF in game, setting the in game frame limit to 5 frames above the target you want, and then using your gpu settings outside the game to turn on vsync that way.) Incidentally, I have heard a dev say in their discord server that ""for some reason, our game doesn't seem to work very well on high end machines"", That is unacceptable! It's probably because it's not optimized well at all.

This brings me to the discord server which is a very important part of the game experience because it is the only way to report bugs. The devs really do not pay attention to the steam forums. However, even on the discord server, bugs get ignored constantly. I have reported bugs several times following their template and supplying the output log as requested only to never get a response, despite them saying in may 2021 in their announcement channel that they will be responding to reports with a checkmark to indicate they noticed it. I understand they have work hours and I am not expecting them to be in the server during their time off - but I reported the honey pouring glitch SEVERAL TIMES while the custom menu patch that broke it WAS STILL IN BETA and they still published the update without even fixing that bug...which then went on to be unfixed for MONTHS afterwards. They only seem to publish several rounds of bug fixes when a new dlc drops and after three or four updates, bugs will go unfixed until the next dlc releases. There are game breaking bugs, like things becoming uninteractable, that have been in the game since launch that are still not fixed. The discord you are directed to for customer support is useless because nobody gets back to you and the mods there are very rude and unhelpful.

The controls are also very janky, and I think a large part of the reason it has so many bugs and why these bugs are so unreplicatable is the very physics system that is the core appeal of gameplay. Sometimes the physics engine will just...freeze. And the only way to fix it is to restart the save/game/sometimes your entire computer. The physics engine is probably responsible for a lot of the lag. Objects will just disappear into space or fly off of plates randomly. I desperately wish this game had mod support simply so that people could fix bugs the developers clearly have no interest in fixing.

This game is basically streamer bait for ""haha look at the wacky physics."" It's impossible to have entertaining gameplay for long term in career mode because of these game breaking bugs, and the devs are not going to fix it any time soon, if ever. It really feels like an early access title still, even though it's had multiple dlcs already. As for the DLC, i have all but shelter, and even the dlc feels like...missing potential almost? Like, why can't we make our own fillings in cakes and cookies? Some dlc bugs are still in the game despite being reported multiple times - like the fact that with a large pizza, you cannot fill the entire pizza with sauce/toppings, which affects your final score. I must have reported the fact that not all the decorating tools spawn in in cakes and cookies sandbox at least three times, with no response.

There IS some fun to be had if you just fool around in sandbox periodically and don't do anything serious - it's basically the only way to play the game in its current state. But overall I can't recommend anybody actually spend money on what is clearly an unfinished game that will never be polished, which is tragic, because there is potential here."

If you've ever watched this game being played on Youtube, you've probably found yourself laughing hysterically at the insane antics on screen. Simple cooking jobs gone horrible wrong, food landing on the floor, pots and pans flying through the room etc. In one memorable episode, a Youtuber attemped to pick up a plate from the counter, but instead ripped off a cabinet door, sending it flying up vertically, hitting and breaking the overhead recipe tv-screen. This, I will openly admit, was one of the most insanely comical moments I've ever witnessed in Youtube gaming.

So if you're looking for a slapstick game of culinary mishaps, this one can be fully recommended. However... if you actually want to play a cooking simulator, you may very well get severely disappointed with this title.

The game suffers from three major problems, add these ingredients together in one recipe and you get a complete disaster.
1) The game relies heavily on pixel-perfect clicking. If you don't get it 100% right, things will go wrong... badly wrong
2) Cooking Simulator suffers from the same kind of weird mouse delay as Car Mechanic Simulator. The cursor somehow seems attached by a rubber band, so you move the mouse, and the cursor starts moving, but you have to wait a bit for the cursor to actually get where you want it to go. It's really hard to explain, but it's a strange sort of fly-by-wire system using a special ""translation-method"" for mouse movement, rather than the standard built-in mouse control.
3) in this game physics are extremely complex: you don't just place something on a plate, you control the angle as well as the 3-dimensional position from which you let go of the item. Get it wrong and the potato (or whatever you're handling) will roll off the plate, or simply land on the floor, because your 3d angle tricked you.

The result of these 3 elements is, that the main focus of this game is, not to actually cook, but instead to try to overcome the physics obstacle course of very, very carefully manoevering your (lagging) mouse cursor to the exact positions required by the game. Now imagine this being a constant requirement for every single action you perform, and you have a game, that literally leaves you utterly exhausted from the constant extreme concentration required. Of course, all of this must be done under intense time pressure and you'll find the game constantly telling you to hurry up, and warning you that the customers are about to lose patience and leave.

It should be added that yes, my PC DOES meet minimum requirements and yes, I DID try adjusting the mouse settings in every way... it just doesn't really help much.

I really, really want to play a cooking simulator, unfortunately this game is not such a thing. Maybe if your hand/eye coordination is super sharp and you have an extreme high-end computer, you will be able to enjoy it, but be warned: just making sure that your PC meets the minimum requirements is not going to be enough."

This is a very hard game to review. I couldn't decide whether or not to recommend it because the glitches are so bad and the play mechanics in some parts are impossible or require ""tricks"" that shouldn't be necessary. The only thing is, the game is truly addicting. However, I wish I had never bought it as it has only brought doom to my life. I no longer want to be a chef.

Things that will annoy you:

1. Cutting things. You have to cut stuff to a certain weight but this can take a long time especially on small items. For example, you would think cutting Brussels Spouts in half would be super easy. Technically it is. However, you have to do it with only one on the cutting board at once because even when your knife is nowhere near the other sprout, it will somehow magically cut it. There will be times where it will not cut what you want and the item just moves. Just let me cut the potato or pumpkin in half for goodness sakes, game!

2. Your pantry sometimes does not update with the new ingredients you need. My apples and potatoes disappeared from the pantry and I'm not sure what else should be there that isn't because I restart the game and it is different. Buying 5 Asparagus at a time or Brussels Sprouts (those evil evil Sprouts) one by one can slow things down even if you buy things before the day starts.

3. Items will say Heating Mistakes when you didn't make any. Now I know, you're probably thinking, well you suck at the game and deserve it. Alas, I promise, I can flip Salmon like a boss but it is hit or miss whether or not it likes my heating even if I did the exact same things and had the exact same coloring on it.

4. Once you get into the more difficult or updated recipes, some will be ridiculous. Maybe I'm a perfectionist, ok I confess I am a perfectionist, but I practice recipes in the Sandbox? mode to make sure I can make them quick. I do prep work in the mornings. My soups are always ready to just heat and serve. Some recipes though, the steps are ridiculous and the game mechanics are so bad that you can only get a perfect score on accident.

Tips:

If you made the bad decision to get this game:

1. Get the 150 Ladle. Stop everything and just get it immediately. Otherwise enjoy wasted soup.
2. You can make your soups at any time and then just heat in a pot (I use the small one) and serve them. Even the more difficult soups. Get the soups, especially the initial ones, and update them because it gives you time when someone orders one so you can work on a different recipe. Don't turn in the soup right away if you need time to do two other dishes (or so on) so that another order doesn't come in right away.
3. You need lots of lemons. Cut those bastards beforehand. In fact, just put some plates with parsley (or oregano twig etc) and the lemons and be ready to top with something else.
4. When you boil something like potatoes, you need to use the colander to strain the liquid or it will give you a message on not enough salt/too much salt.
5. When it asks you to drizzle something, get the colander and just cover the item in it without even bothering to measure. Some items can only absorb so much oil so you'll waste liquid but as least your items are covered like they are supposed to be.
6. Don't get the bruschetta recipe. Try to avoid recipes that say to make a mixture of spices and liquid which you then use to drizzle on stuff. If it is just say salmon topped with 5 ml of lemon juice then that is one thing, but the drizzling mechanic for mixtures is just near impossible.
7. Buy the meat ahead of time and season it. Just have some seasoning fun. They don't spoil so you can leave out fish and meat which you seasoned laying around and then just cook to order.
8. Don't try to reach too far for plates and bottles. Also don't stand too fast if holding these items and crouched. Things will break. I've somehow mastered the art of not breaking stuff so just be patient and you too shall never break plates or bottles again. I never wasted the points on the unbreakable plates and bottles because you'll want the others.
8. The perks that slow time when chopping and for being able to see the temp through the oven are very good. Also the holding still one.
9. Don't punch your computer. You will be having the perfect day, critic and people loved your food and then BAM glitch or you mess up. Your game freezes or lags. You get one of the impossible recipes and your perfect day is down the hole.
10. Google some of the recipes because there might be work arounds you just are not seeing. (Like the drizzling in a colander thing)

Please stop releasing new stuff and fix things!"

Coming from someone that has been doing challenge runs and speed runs. Playing this was a nice change of pace.
If you have some kitchen experience, remember what it was like to actually prep food before opening time. For instance, I slice my veggies, and have about 5 of each meat already seasoned and ready to go. Do not throw out soup after making 1 bowl, store it somewhere until the next order, throw it on the stove for a few minutes and then serve.
My only warning, DO NOT unlock 7 or more recipes at once and expect to be able to prep them before opening, you will find yourself overwhelmed. Another delightful thing about the game is, you can say screw it, and stop cooking start breaking pretty much everything... I blew up the kitchen and started throwing T.V. screens everywhere.

Now with that part done some things I have issues with. For one, I constantly set things down onto things I'm trying to pick up the 'sweet spot' for these items feels fickle, with that in mind, if I am using the large circular tray/plate and set it down onto something it bugs out and everything on the tray will go flying, little funny at first incredibly irritating in the middle of rush. I also noticed that you cannot put a large pot on the back burner and a pan on the front burner properly, the pan will sit tilted thus leading to heating issues with the dish. I have also had an issue with items disappearing or clipping through the counter tops. Two of my sauce pans were on center stovetop, something bugged out and they both freaked out broke a t.v. screen made a huge mess everywhere, and the pans just disappeared, and now I cannot use those center burners even after repairs. That is it for the minor bugs, overall i really love the game!

My suggestion for possible content or sequel.
If it is not possible to do in this game (i have heard from your dev that you may be doing larger kitchens and stuff in the future)
But if not possible with this game, I would like to see a multiplayer feature. Again if not possible with this title, maybe consider doing 'Diner Simulator', providing maybe 3 roles. Chef, Sous Chef and waiter/prep, Giving you a decent little team to create or destroy something beautiful."

TLDR: The concept was satisfying, however both Career and Sandbox mode missed the sweet spot of being ""fun while challenging"". Sandbox mode is unsatisfyingly unchallenging whilst Career mode is too chaotic.

Sandbox mode is for you to experiment and get wacky in the game, or maybe let's cook from your imagination! You spent a lot of times trying to create an instagramable food. No matter what you do, it always look like a pile of sh*t. Destroying and burning the whole kitchen will be what you see the most on Youtube, because the players don't know what to do in sandbox.

The Career Mode is fun in early stage. Once you managed to get 3 stars restaurant, the experiences become a chaos as you are the only chef that singlehandedly need to memorize abundant of recipes that ranges from seafood into steak, with entirely different ingredients for the whole day. This can happen because you don't decide the recipes, your supervisor do instead. This is Cooking Simulator, not Kitchen Nightmare TV Show. You are the chef after all, you should be able to control the recipes, not them! Even Spongebob can't cook other than Krabby Patty!"

Former Chef here

The little I've played makes it hard to recommend unfortunately. A lot of things that should be fairly straightforward to perform are made unnecessarily difficult - for example assembling a burger. When attempting to place a slice of onion or tomato, the game defaults to placing them down vertically instead of flat, forcing you to spend a frustrating amount of time manually aligning and rotating each individual piece to place them down. Likewise if for example you wanted to pre season trout or salmon during prep to save yourself time later, you'd naturally think (or at least I would...) to place them all on a tray, except that the game will stack them up in the middle of the tray instead of laying them out. For a game that focuses quite a lot on getting things done quickly / in time, the game itself gets in the way too much and makes for a frustrating experience. I get that this is equal parts a physics sandbox, but I think there's areas where the physics adds to the experience, and other areas where it detracts.

I'd also say, having ran shifts in a commercial kitchen solo, most of the dishes require too many steps for one person to tackle alone - there's a reason most kitchens of this size would have multiple stations and I don't feel like the game compensates enough with the timers for this. I'd love to see multiplayer implemented - not only would it share out the tasks in a way that makes more sense, but the derpiness of the physics also lends itself much better to playing with others and bantering about the dumb crap that's going on.

To cap off these main negative points are smaller frustrations such as the oven being buggy and taking damage simply from opening and closing the door.

One big thing however I will say that the game does well is the FEELING of being the middle of service - being halfway through one order when another comes in, and having to adjust the plan in your head on the fly to make a start on the next while finishing the current. Took me back to some of the (few) memorable moments of hitting the flow state and flawlessly throwing order after order through the pass. Feels good."

This is a very underrated gem for what it is, a cooking game.

I remember watching videos and streamers rip up the whole kitchen or try so hard to play it safe in this game without something bugging, spilling, or breaking on them, and I have to say, they were all playing it wrong. THE GAME PLACES YOUR FOOD FOR YOU.

I’m on day 10 and I have not broken a single dish or had the food glitch out on me. Why? Because I played it how the tips and tutorial suggested it. It’s an insane level of difference once you realize that you can place your food out of anything, pots, pans, bowls, whatever, and onto your plate if you stay still while doing it. You don’t have to use the spatula, tongs, or anything to place food other than this way. Just grab it, and if it’s too hot, it’s likely already done, so put it on a plate via clicking it with a plate in hand. Flipping is the only chore so far and you get used to it.

The game is a lot more fun long term wise, when you’re not un-intentionally playing it like a 4head.

Edit: You can automatically transfer liquid with the ladles too."

I like this game a lot, the concept is nice, replay value is good, and there's a lot of things you can do. But honestly, I don't recommend the game due to fact that it's hard to play it without encountering any issues/bugs/glitches.

TL;DR: Play it if you don't mind encountering some bugs and issues in your gameplay.

My actual expectation of a playable game IMO is if the game isn't causing uncomfortable issues to your gameplay. I bought the game with the thought of wanting to relax after a long day of work. But I end up trying to troubleshoot my save more than actually playing it. Which is already what I do in my day job. ; w;

Anyway, expectations aside, I just wanted to point out a couple of things this game can improve (aside from fixing the bugs):

1. Tutorials - Currently, tutorials are very linear. A lot of parts have to be done exactly step-by-step, the consequences of not doing so can cause the tutorial NPC to bug you till you repeat the step in exactly the way it was instructed or getting stuck on the tutorial till you restart it.

Players who's either already familiar or wants to get crafty about the tutorial doesn't get enough freedom to do so. In example: you exactly have to pour the Chicken Stock from the carton or pot and game doesn't allow you to use the ladle. This means that instead of carefully measuring your ingredients, you'll be forced to eyeball them.

2. No matter how good your PC is, it feels like the game isn't built to do bulk cooking. Try making a bulk of something and see your game start to lag due to the amount of rendered items. Would be nice if the impact can be lessen.

Eitherway, if you choose to buy this game, I would definitely recommend getting Cakes and Cookies DLC, the gameplay mechanic from the DLC is more relaxed and has more freedom to be creative."

genuinely, i really like this game, it's very comfortable to play and i've started to play it more and more on a daily basis while streaming to my best friend

however, there is something that's been entirely bothering me; the ""customize menu"" option that you don't get to change later in the game

once you pick to have or not have the ability to customize your menu and choose what recipes you want to make, you do not get the opportunity to change that decision ever again unless you effectively restart the game

i, deciding i'd never end up using it and preferring having a lot more randomness, now find myself wishing i went for it to get rid of easier recipes (i.e. fast pumpkin soup) or recipes i really suck at (i.e. duck broth), but since i'm about to hit my third level of fame, i'm pretty unwilling to go all the way back just to change my decision

genuinely do not understand why this option is a one-time thing and why we can't choose to enable it later down the line; or why it's not just enabled by default (assuming players can have as many items on their menu as they want) considering how convenient it is (which i wish i realized way long ago)

dunno, it just feels scummy having to restart because i wanted to change my mind on something that you just don't get to change later down the line, and i really hope the dev(s) rethink that and make it something you can change down the line

but, for now, i'm just gonna hope i can find an alternative to enabling the option without restarting mid-run by file editing or something like that"

The real fun is in messing around with propane tanks and fire, or at least sticking to sandbox modes. At the moment, when you do try to get serious through objective-based modes, many frustrating bugs and physics issues get in the way every now and then, which usually results in wasted time and failures. You end up having to fight one of these issues at least once per game day once you're doing the more complex recipes:

1. The basic act of cutting things may just stop working on you. Scallions sometimes end up becoming the hardest substance on Earth and resist the very first cut.
2. Saving and loading is very dangerous if you were mid-cooking. Soups suddenly have NaN% ingredients, bowls explode and dump all of its contents everywhere, lives get ruined.
3. Solid food phase through their container if you move too quickly. The coolest part is when you place the completed meal on the serving counter, and the act of doing so makes all the food fly away, making you serve a completely empty dish.
4. Many recipe steps can be completely ignored because the game clearly doesn't support some food interactions. Garlic sauce doesn't need garlic. You can have horseradish sprinkled on trout pre-bake, and not post-bake; you never need to chop ingredients that will never be in the final plate.
5. Drizzling sucks and is surprisingly non-intuitive. If the game tells you to drizzle a mix of soy sauce, oil, and vinegar onto something, it's easier to just flood the food with the three different liquids one after another. Or else you have to perform the herculean task of distributing 10mL of a liquid to a dozen different things.

When playing Career Mode, the most efficient move is to not do anything fun. Prepare 3L of basic soups at the day's start, serve within 10 seconds of the order being given, and end up doing 20 orders a day because the customers instantly come after each dish. This means completely avoiding recipes with names ""french fries"". By god, avoid french fries at all costs.

While these bugs might be temporary and will be fixed in the future, they have not been fixed since their release, so I have no hope for that. If you're a streamer looking for a Goat Simulator experience in a kitchen, this is for you. Otherwise, not really."

Cooking Simulator is a one of a kind game. See, I love cooking in real life. Cooking is such a rewarding experience. Pouring your soul into a dish, serving it to people, and seeing the dish put a smile on their face is just an exhilarating feeling that only cooking can give you. And that is why I am so glad Cooking Simulator exists, because I know that in real life, I will never get the opportunity to see just how BAD I can make a dish. Cooking Simulator is beautiful because you can TRULY do whatever you please without real life consequences. If doing what you please is cooking a flawless and presentable 5 star meal, go ahead. If doing what you please is overcooking a steak with a blowtorch and then marinating it in soap and a disgusting, thick blend of burnt pumpkin-eggplant sludge, go ahead. You have freedom to do as you please.

Overall, Cooking Simulator is a hilarious time waster with fantastic graphics, wacky physics, and lots of content. It is buggy from time to time, but there is no bug that is unbearable. Purchase this game now while it is still on sale. You won't regret it."

I have mixed feelings on this game. I have had my eye on it for a long time, and initially tried it on Nintendo Switch because it was on sale for $1.99. The controls on the Switch are garbage so I decided to get it on PC since it had piqued my interest.

I spent 14 hours in a matter of a 4 days playing this game. It definitely takes time to get used to the mechanics and game play. When first starting, the tutorial really doesn't feel like enough to get you started. I would recommend spending sometime playing around in Sandbox mode and practicing before attempting any of the career modes.

I was having a blast playing this game and getting pretty good. That is until drizzling became a thing. The drizzling mechanic is basically non existent. You put some sauce in a bowl and then pour all the sauce at once on to your food and it ""drizzles"" it. If you are lucky it doesn't go all at once. But you can't control the flow. It is easier to drizzle straight from the bottle than how the game instructs you to. What ends up happening is you have to do it over and over again to get the food more evenly covered. It is a waste of time and energy and makes the game incredibly tedious.

The higher level recipes almost all include this mechanic and since it is so variable it is hard to get 5 stars on taste. This pretty much ruined the game for me and I am probably going to stop playing. Fix the drizzle and I would be back for more in an instant."

While i don't have many hours on my steam game I played for a year in testing. Honestly for a full release it still feels Early Access, the game has no depth as a cooking sim and it has no depth as a management sim. Here is my full review and why I can not recommend it.

Good-
*Graphics are beautiful
*Concept is fun
*A fair range or ingredients
*A skill tree and unlocks

Bad
*This Game truly is not optimized and performance makes it Laggy and stutter.

*Tutorial is frustrating and leaves you not feeling confident.

*Controls NEED help as they are confusing.

* Career path had no back story
* No temps or real recipes- The microwave has to low settings yet the stove does not, the recipes are not some thing most people would order like salmon and 2 Full boiled potatoes not cut.

*Cutting/chopping/plating is all horribly executed, you can not make a plate look pretty I'm career mode.

*You can not customize your own menu

*Finances make no sense bc you buy the ingredients and plates while you cook.

BIGGEST ISSUE OF ALL the game feels stale and needs a crew of ai cooks. Doing it all by yourself gets boring

* No MULTIPLAYER! The game is perfect for friends yet fails to deliver.

In the words of Chef Gordon this is still RAWWW! If you do try this make sure you get it on sale it is not worth $20 in its current state. The devs seem responsive and may fix this issues, I will change my review at a later date as it progresses."

The Cakes and Cookies DLC is good. The main game, however, is VERY glitchy. If you put food on a plate, it can never stack like the photo shows. You have to place items next to each other and the customers give you a bad rating. If you put pork on a plate and walk, it falls on the floor. its reeeeeeally hard to flip a burger or piece of fish. It just feels really unfinished. Food doesn't float in the air. Please sort the physics out. It's unplayable"
cooking+simulator,Not Recommended,3.4,"Posted: July 9, 2019
I would not recommend this game. I really wanted to like it, but it has three major shortcomings which make it unpleasant:

Bad optimization
Framerates vary wildly depending on what you are doing and where you are looking regardless of graphics settings. When the framerate drops, input lag jumps. This is frustrating when making precise moves and looking around a busy kitchen.


Some tasks (like chopping and pouring) require unusual precision from the player, while other tasks (like plating) are helped along massively by the game. Worse yet, some tasks combine realistic ease with stupid difficulty. For example, the game will help you by positioning food perfectly on your spatula! But then you have to precisely position and angle the spatula as the food slides off in a goofy way. Cooking Simulator should either be realistically simple or hilariously hard. When it's both, the player is just confused and annoyed.


Spices often fall through the food, so you have to examine the surface to see if one sprinkle of pepper phased its way onto the chopping board. If there are multiple objects on a plate (like chopped potatoes), they tend to flip out and fly away. Don't be surprised if the game accepts a perfect dish on the serving counter and then delivers an empty plate to the customer, leaving you with amazing food objects just floating around."

Wow does it pain me to not recommend this game. The cooking is so much fun, the recipes sound amazing, and the entire idea is exactly what I would've dreamed of in a cooking game. However, there are two big issues. The first is the amount of small glitches, things will fly off your plate, spill randomly, or flat out disappear, making it impossible to serve food on time. The second is the amount of detail needed to make some of the items (specifically things like fries), where you will have to spend minutes cutting potatoes to get them not terrible. There is so much potential in this game and I will keep checking in with it but as of right now it is just not something I am able to play."

The physics of the game just make it very unenjoyable for me. It's tagged as a ""realistic simulation,"" which is accurate I suppose if you want to realistically experience how it would feel to attempt to cook while operating a forklift."

I used to work in a kitchen when I was 19/20.
Game caused some sort of PTSD attack where I really started to sweat....game seems a bit to ""real"" for me :-)

Seems in need of some more optimization, as my GTX 1060 (6GB) went into overdrive, but it is playable.

I do think that this game would benefit from a co-op mode but there is a lot of fun to be had as it is.

Certainly a fun game with addictive gameplay and novel concept. To me this feels like a much more elaborate version of ""papa's ria"" series online flash games, one that I could easily get addicted to and spend tons of hours on.

There is one crippling problem currently with this game: there exist way too many bugs. In my mere 7 hours of gameplay I have encountered numerous bugs, from inconveniences and annoyances such as items getting stuck inside surfaces and become irremovable, items falling through solid objects, doors not behaving normally for no apparent reason, to completely game ruining ones such as becoming unable to perform any actions including accessing the system menu, forcing me to alt+F4. I would not recommend purchasing this game in its full price until it gets more stable."

This game is great! The physics, the building, and the destruction. but there is an issue.
Servers...
You see, Camodo Gaming is a kids YouTube channel. he makes up most of brick rigs content. Which means a bunch of little kids who still think cooties are a thing are ruining brick rigs servers. They make servers with rules comparable to Roblox cafe games, and when you do something that their child minds don't like, they ban you. Same thing when you piss off a kid for some small insignificant thing, they start blaring ""KICK (this guy).""

Then you find a server not run by some self centered or dictatorial kid. Things are going great, having a fun time and all. Then out of nowhere some kid who can hardly speak proper english yet walks in and spawns a lag machine of a black hole or nuke, destroying the map or crashing the server in the process. It is very uncommon to find that one perfect server, not too much authority but not too much chaos. Eventually, a young child joins and then ruins the server. I know, a lot to read but not much."

Dear developer,

Well played, Brick Rigs.

This game is rediculous. It's Beam MG physcis with legos. They just added guns and roles to the beta.
They made a game for kids to make cars. We made tanks. They saw what community picked up this game, and they catered to it. Best freakin' buisness strategy I've seen: give the players what they want.

Outstanding job guys, really. Thanks for a great game.


Sincerely,
Mammal Fur"

THAT GAME...

...Will give you feels that you may not have had anywhere else !

You might say : ""Oh but it's like Besiege.""
MAYBE, EXCEPT THAT YOU GET SATISFACTION FROM YOUR OWN DESTRUCTION.

You might also say : ""Oh but it's like Simpleplanes !""
MAYBE, BUT AT LEAST THE DEV BEHIND THIS GAME ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTED MULTIPLAYER.

You might even say : ""Oh but it's lik BeamNGDrive !""
MAYBE, BUT WITH LEGOs, THEREFORE BETTER.

To be more serious now, Brick Rigs had a lot of potential when I got it, and it's still as fresh now.

The 1 man dev team that created Brick Rigs is always active, and we get a mindblowing update every month !
To give you an idea, in the span of 1 year, we got :
-Multiplayer
-Aerodynamics
-Helicopter improvements
-GUNS, both handheld and vehicle mounted
-PVP gamemode
-Space map
-Large Desert Map
-Variety of materials to make your bricks from
-A good bunch of new, essential bricks

And I may have not noticed all of the updates, the game looked decent when I had it, yet it was only 7 months old !

So, if you have the spirit of a creative child, the rage of a WW2 pilot or the audacity of a stunt driver, then go ahead and buy it ! This game is worth 15$ right now and this price will get more and more meaning as the updates come up."

When I was younger, I always enjoyed to play with Lego's. Whenever I got an opportunity, I ran to the store to buy a Lego set (or I asked my parents kindly.) My fingers were always itchy, I had to build Lego vehicles. When I first discovered this game, I was really happy. Now I can build vehicles that resemble the vehicles I always used to build as a kid, or just go wild and build something else. I love it, I really love this game.

The only things I would love to see added in a future version of this game are: an AI system with vehicles driving around the city, some more types/shapes of bricks so you can build even more crazy vehicles and maybe some indicators for your vehicle.

For the rest this game is really good, I reccomend it to everyone who likes building Lego vehicles and drive them around."

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Brick Rigs is a game about building and messing around with LEGO vehicles. They can’t use the name for legal reasons, but we all know the truth.

So cutting to the chase, would I recommend it? Yes. But there are a few things worth noting. Let’s get into it.

Pros:
- Core gameplay is fun and well executed
- Destroying LEGO creations never gets old, and you can use a rocket launcher to boot.
- Steam workshop integration to share and download creations
- Surprisingly good graphics and world physics
- Intuitive menus and easy to learn controls
- Really big maps to mess around on
- Can slow down and speed up time as you please

Cons:
- Lacking in content and polish, given that it’s Early Access
- Not great for multiplayer, although the option to play with friends does exist.
- Trains tend to derail pretty often which can get annoying.
- Building on the point above, the lack of a checkpoint or save state system hinders your ability to explore with your creations. You will almost always crash before you get far.
- Character models feel like cheap placeholders, and there’s no way to customize them or your gear, beyond selecting a job like Police Officer or Firefighter.
- There’s a zombie killing mode, which is cool, but it’s barebones right now. It could be really great in the future though. I’m thinking like LEGO Call of Duty Zombies, but that might be setting the bar too high.
- This last one is my opinion and could be seen as a Pro, but you can place bricks inside of other bricks. This allows for more unique designs as well as more compact designs, but goes against the spirit of LEGOs/brick building games. Bricks are designed to connect to other bricks. That’s the whole point. If I can make something in a game, I should be able to take real bricks and make it in real life. It also leads to glitchy, overlapping textures in some cases, which is annoying to look at.

So overall, I’d give it a 7.9/10.

What it does, it does well, for the most part. The foundation has been laid for a great game. That said, there’s definitely room for improvement. It comes down to how dedicated the developer is in the future, but that’s really the nature of Early Access, isn’t it? If you love LEGOs and want to support/encourage the dev, it’s a pretty safe purchase. I certainly don’t regret it."

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
First thing I'm gonna say is: I love this game. It's fun to mess around in, it's fun to build, and it's helped me make a lot of great friends. But I can't recommend this game. I love it, I can't stress that enough. But I doubt you will. The developer won't give us a changelog. He won't listen to the community, and, oh the community. What a pile of rubbish it is! They have this insane idea that, when someone like me and a group of friends suggests something AS MINUTE AS A CHANGELOG, they go bat****. They say ""he isn't your slave"", ""He can do what he wants"", and **** like that. I am sorry, but I just cannot stand it. We give a suggestion, and they dogpile on us. The moderators slander us, the community accuses us of spamming dislikes on anything on the front page (despite the fact that it happened to us as well, and that moderators can check that ****, but instead they sit on their lazy ***es and endorse the toxicity to anyone who disagrees). As I said, I love this game. Or should I say, loved. The develpoer cared about the developements and the community, oh the comunity, was just us. Me, some friends, some who were to be friends and conform to the toxicity, and some who were to be friends and eventually get shunned for speaking out. It's a hivemind. This is from someone who was inside or a while. So my conclusion? Don't bother. Get a Lego game, try out Scrap Mechanic or Rigs of Rods, but whatever you do, no NOT get sucked into this community's endless pit of toxicity.

Update: I have taken an almost year long hiatus from this game to clear my mind, and I've come back to it to play with close friends and no one else. What I've gathered from my time back in the game, with no disrespect, is that the developer constantly makes decisions that are, what I would call, regressive. There are, of course, good parts of updates, but his updates seem to be mainly focused on new gimmicky bricks and maybe a graphical update every now and then, and less on actual optimization and bugfixes. There definitely has been an attempt at both, but I feel it is still being overshadowed by, frankly, unnecessary and frequently bug-ridden content. As for the community, I wouldn't know. I have been banned from the discord (It was so long ago, I don't know if it was justified or not, but for the review I will assume it was), and I don't spend enough time on the Steam Workshop so I can stay away from the drama and mob-mentality that I felt plagued the community before my hiatus. Unfortunately, I still cannot recommend the game. The developer is definitely working harder on the game and I feel the quality is improving, but over the years of owning and playing the game, I fear one simple brick or gamemode (like guns) has, and will again, plague the community with immature kids who want nothing better than to shoot everything they see. I don't want to hate on the people who chose to spend money on this game, but I personally wouldn't suggest you pick it up, unless you intend on making your own vehicles and having fun with a close group of friends."

I didn't realize how fun building my own frankenstein lego vehicles, driving them, and ultimately smashing them (slo-mo toggled of course) could be. The vehicle building interface took maybe 30 secs to figure out and after that it was a breeze snapping my own creations together. Yes this is Early Access, yes there are a few bugs and some things are not as polished as others, but for an early access game developed by a 1-man dev team it's insanely fun and well optimized. I can't wait till there's more quests and environments available. Looking forward to future updates!"

Being honest here, I think this game shows a lot of potential. I know its in early access, so features will be added as the game development progresses.

While playing, I had a great time in the city, running around and just blowing things up, ya know, being a child lol. After my little destruction, I decided to try out building vehicles. I found the menu to be pretty hard to navigate, but the more I used it the easier it became and the more I understood what I was doing. Unfortunatly, I never got any of my creations to NOT explode.. but I'm sure I'm messing something simple up.

I think once this game develops more and maybe a tutorial is added, that this can turn into something really great!"

I am a 63 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

I really like Brick Rigs it is a good game for people who like a sandbox game modes. For the last couple of years Brick Rigs has not been getting ANY support but now Brick Rigs has got a HUGE update that basically changes the entire game. The game seems to now be getting a updates and will hopefully be continuously getting new updates. The game has some good physics and you are able to drive cars, fly planes and even get Aggravated over trying to stop and unstoppable train. (you can also drive trains and it has something call zombie mode) This game is awesome and it is multiplayer too so have fun with your friends. hope this helps you! Have a good day.

I've been a massive fan of this game for years and I hoped the 1.0 update would remove the things that really bugged me. Those were:
-The game is called Brick RIGS implying you're supposed to make vehicles, yet WHEELS don't work! If you drive faster than 50 kmh, you're playing Russian roulette as they randomly bounce and throw you off the cliff...
-The engines should distribute power among driving wheels, instead power is multiplied by each driving wheel. Want to go faster? Just add more wheels!
-Gears don't work. Instead of lower gears having more torque and less speed and higher ones having less torque and more speed, here, the higher the gear, the higher the power and speed! Want to go like a rocket? Just switch to manual mode and switch to 6th gear immediatelly, touch the accelerator and you are ballistic!
-Aero is hit and miss... There is no drag, you continually gain speed while falling. There is no sense in how it works either!

All of these would be ESSENTIAL to a game focused on making vehicles, right? Years later, 1.0 arrives and it fixes... None of those... I'm sorry, dev. It's time we part ways.

EDIT 20/09/2023: Seems that wheels finally don't launch your vehicle randomly. Nice. The other gripes I had are still there though."

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
I have loved playing Brick Rigs for many years, it is like playing with legos except you can actually drive them, fly them, and smash them with no consequences! This game has brought me MANY hours of tireless fun with activities such as street racing, building, and living in a lego world. The controls are simple and easy to get used to, the physics are hilarious, and the multiplayer is fantastic, creating a comical yet comfortable game that is an absolute joy to play.
At this point in the review you must be wondering why I gave this game a thumbs down when there is so much to love about it. My reasoning, is that Brick Rigs 1.0 update ruined the game. I am sure that many other reviews have said the same things, but everybody wanted the 1.0 update to have useful fixes such as better tire traction, better severs, new bricks, more maps, and other useful features. However, these expected changes were not to be, and instead we got a worse game than we started with. Servers are laggier than ever, the new UI is awful, the previously simple and intuitive game I loved has been ruined. Everyone I know who used to play Brick Rigs has stopped playing because of the update. The new 1.0 update has made one of my favorite games into an example of how a perfect, enjoyable, charming, and simple, game can be turned into something not even worth playing, let alone paying for. I am sad to see what Brick Rigs has become."

My gaming habits changed recently quite rough, no doubt! I've never thought I'd play Farming Simulator over 200 hours but damn, that game was awesome! And here I am over 100 hours playing Brick Rigs! Shoot me in the head please!

Nah, just kidding! Playing with LEGO or LEGO-like toys is still fun even for an adult over his thirties. To be honest when my nephews visit me I just can't stop playing with their Duplo trucks and excavators and building crazy stuffs together.

Can't wait for my baby boy to be born!

Until then I could stick to Brick Rigs!

Best game on Steam for car and brick fans. Considering how awesome it's physics nothing can beat it on the sandbox market! Keep up the good work devs!"

Brick Rigs is a great game for kids and adults alike. I have fond memories of playing with Legos with my siblings and remember crashing our cars together. Brick Rigs lets me do this agian as an adult and at a much faster pace. There are so many cool cars in the workshop and it never gets old watching them crash. I just recently signed up for the Beta and the work that has been put into this game is great. Zombies is a ton of fun to play. Here is a video of me checking out Zombie mode
. Great Game"

The game is very fun, however after about 20 hours of messing around with workshop content and the zombie mode it got a bit tiresome. The multiplayer seems to have gotten worse lately and is still super buggy. The only reason i would really recommend the game is that the initial 20 hours is awesome and multiplayer ww2 tank battlles in lego tanks is just tons of fun. But 7/10 times the MP games will crash or lag so badly its unplayable.

Development has been very slow. I bought the game back in September 2017 and in June 2018 i really cant tell a difference. I still would recommend I just would like to see some more significant progress. Especially in game modes and multiplayer stability."

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
It's like a cross between LEGO digital designer and an open world LEGO game, is the simplest I can put it. Everyone has either played a LEGO game or had a go at Digital Designer, but here you get to play with what you've built. It's a fun thing to mess around with and see how far you can push the limit of both your own designs and creativity and how far you can push the physics engine! It's got an active community and the workshop is filled with great designs and builders (plug for my own workshop here). You can either play online or single player, but the latter is more for building a designing something as you can't get that much fun out of going things by yourself.

However, despite the good, there is some bad and I mean quite a lot of bad actually. The multiplayer is unstable when here's more than 1,000 bricks out, even after it was updated once. This has been improved with a full release, but multiplayer is still a bit buggy. Many servers are filled with kids mad with admin powers and I suggest generally avoiding joining random servers and instead making one with friends instead. There are some minor bugs and glitches, but none that I've found 'break the game'. While I did praise the community, many of them are screaming kids who don't know how to construct a proper sentence or argument from what I've seen (again, I tend to stay away from the discussions page to avoid being dragged into one). However, the biggest problem many have is the lack of constant updates. The games is built by one man and one man only who is working hard to make this game as good as he can with his limited free time, which I must applaud as there's no way I could ever make a game like this.

Overall, do I say this is worth it after all that criticism? Yes, I do. It's a fun game to design and create in and I've spent many hours as you can tell making tanks, planes, cars, buildings and set pieces. It's a very versatile game which you can spend hours in making anything from a humble hatchback to a massive aircraft carrier. It embodies the LEGO freedom we all wanted as a kid but couldn't get because we didn't have the right bricks. Let your imagination run free and stay away from this discussion page!"

Fluppi, I have 2k hours in this game and I'm only reviewing it now. Thanks for 1.0, thanks for experimental, and thanks for finally helping us modders out. I can't wait to see more!

And if you're reading this and you don't have brick rigs, WHAT THE F*CK ARE YOU WAITING FOR?!

This is literally the lego game that all lego games wish they could be. The only true lego game where you can let your creativity fly rather than play on rails, this game already allows you to do almost anything and, with the path it's headed with the new updates, it's only getting better!

If you grew up playing Lego Creator and Lego Racers (maybe even Lego Stunt Rally), then you'll probably like this. It's like BeamNG Drive/Rigs of Rods but with Lego.

The editor is a tad daunting at first, but you should have it figured out by the time you make your second or third vehicle.

It is a bit limited as far as content/gameplay, but then again, so is basically every Lego/Lego-wannabe game. At least it's better than running through a child-friendly parody of a blockbuster movie title collecting 1x1 round plates, amirite?"

If you like LEGO and want it to come to life, this is the game for you, even if you don't like LEGO, it's still very fun to play, unlike stormworks, (You may have not heard of it, but its fun) you don't need to be so advanced just to make a good build, sure it can be kinda hard to build even in brick rigs, but it is easier than stormworks, all and all, this game is worth the buy. And if you do buy it/already have it, have a great time on it!"

Brick Rigs
It's every little kid's dream to be able to drive their LEGO or Megabloks creation. Well, now you can!

This game is way to nice to look at than it should be, the Unreal engine gives it a lot of depth and the lighting effects are fantastic.
Much liking having a bucket of LEGOs, you have an unlimited access to blocks of almost any variety to build what ever you want, as long as you have the patience.
When I finally sat down and started in the builder instead of drivinbg one of the many Workshop cars, I found it relativly easy to use. All the nessesary control and colour changes are there as well as an easy menu. It may be a bit tedious, but it's easy, so you can easliy get used to it.

I started doing builds and uploading them to the workshop. I now have had several vehicles top the Workshop boards, proving that even I can build great things!


Now, there are a few issues.
For one, the physics are kinda odd. Things don't like to stop or turn. Or go in a perfect straight line for that matter, either.
You will lag out later on if you start using large vehicles, so watch your brick count or stay in single player!


Bottom line?

bus+simulator+21+next+stop,Not Recommended,24.7,"Posted: September 10, 2021
Purchased this game on the launch day, i have been playing daily since then.

What i like:
> Nice buses to drive and quite many and various brands

> Multiplayer mode

> Freedom to choose where and what time u wish to drive

> NPCs actually overtake if you are parked on the side of the road (Bus stop or any road)

> Route planning actually has some challenge as there is an need to plan the route based on demands and peak times. you will also need to schedule the right buses for those routes.

Eg. for the city ""Oakwood"" ideally you will want small electric buses instead of gigantic buses as this will help move your profit higher. (50k vs 150k). Also there is types of route.

Problems i faced:
> Weather (Really kinda upset by the weather, it always just rains or not)

> NPC dialogues. Once you played couple of hours like, u will realize that the NPCs keeps saying the same all sentences and it gets kinda annoying after awhile

> Multiplayer mode can't chat meaning if you are playing with strangers, you guys kinda just start honking at each other. Morse code huh lol

> Still pretty buggy.
- AI's walking off the bridge in oakwood and landing on the road below the bridge
- Player & NPC missing umbrellas when alighting from bus
- Wheelchair NPC's Umbrella kind of glitched and broken
- NPC's arms sticking out of bus sometimes when they do ""actions""
- Random little bump into a sedan at 15km/h causes the car to fly away ( just lolx )

> AI bus drivers just stop moving at bus stops to wait till their ""Supposed"" time to leave (when their counter reaches 0"" This causes u to be late as u cannot let passenger get off or on and even if you manage to, you get smacked by a penalty for ""bad parking"".

> AI traffic blocking the road when they should proceed to turn right at stop signs or when they have the right of way

Improvements i suggest:

> Fix the above i have mentioned in ""problems i faced""

> Implement heavier traffic during peak hours and more variety of cars

> Allow bus stops to have more than 1 bus at the same time (By parking behind them and lined up if the bus stop is long enough)

> As others have said, we could have emergency vehicles to make the environment more realistic

> Add a whether forecast with temperatures and whether it would rain

> Make rain not a ""everyday"" thing and ""variable rain density"" (currently it will just rain everyday as i see)

> Hoping to see fully crowded buses during peak hours

> Really wish they add a multiplayer chat (that be really helpful)

> NPCs don't do frequent brake checks on your bus. (I've encountered this multiple times)

Verdict:

I personally don't think it is the right time to buy this game now as they have not fixed alot of stuff and neither is it a big deal breaker from Bus Simulator 2018. Perhaps when they have fixed the issues mentioned, it will be worth buying.

Qn : Am i satisfied or pleased?
Ans: Meh. I'm honestly not but neither is it bad. its just hmmm

I am a HUGE fan of the 2018 bus simulator, to me that was PEAK Bus Simulation. The controls were easy to handle the bus felt great to drive and the game was set out nicely!

I waited for hours for the release of this game, to be greeted with a half finished badly controlled game.
- There are issues with the clothes clipping, cars driving through people, cars driving into your character and pushing them down the road and your character clipping into cars which upsets the character's model camera.
-The camera angle is funky the character movement feels off too, Being able to run sideways while trying to run forward doesn't seem to normal.
-Now for the bus controls, the bus turning circle is way too extreme, the bus is so sensitive and i couldn't adjust the seats for the life of me! The driving mechanic feels so messy and the HUD for the controls is unorganised and at times nonexistent.
-There are cars on the road which don't follow road rules, they will drive out in-front of your bus and at times drive right through people walking on the street.
-NPC's will stand on the side of the road and with no warning will sprint onto the road in-front of your bus which will cause you to collide with them.


If a system isn't broken it shouldn't need to be fixed, if this game had the controls of bus simulator 2018 it would've been a lot more enjoyable, i'm not even going to try and give it a chance as i don't want to play this game for more then 2 hours as i will be refunding it."

NEW POST as of JUNE 2023

This game has improved significantly, especially with the recent map expansion, as I said in some of of my earlier comments my two young sons enjoyed this game EVEN with all its previous flaws, however it got to the point that even they lost interest until......this year, we've ALL come back to the game, it's becoming quite enjoyable, the devs are paying attention to the players and I thank Tamara (DEV) for the feedback given to my earlier review. You can read Tamara's post in terms of the most pressing issues addressed, and a LOT of them HAVE addressed, that being said however, their are still SOME glitches, such as passengers clipping thru roofs when standing up, the wheels on the bus don't go round and round, meh! I'm not going to nit pick too much as these things don't kill the game or spoil enjoyment too much, there has been great improvement, for me one of the most profound high points of the game is the shear customization features (why is there a red wavy line under customization? damn this British keyboard!)
Anyhoo....bonus on the improvements, and as long as those creases stay ironed out, things are finally looking up for Bus Sim 21 nxt stop....ergo.....I recommend, I really do!



OLD REVIEW FROM 2022 BELOW (to be removed in due course)

I can't recommend this to anyone at the moment because there are WAY TOO MANY issues that I, and other players are experiencing. NPC (Non Player Characters) issues are exhaustive and they appear to have a death wish which is ALL TOO contagious!

- Drivers frequently crashing buses into stationary objects and scenery for no apparent reason.
- Pedestrians Jay walking on highways and byways OR taking a stroll along the medians that divide them.
- NPC drivers have glitchy, jittery arm movements on the steering wheel, as if they're having some kind of seizure.
- Larger buses and double ""deckers"" constantly get stuck on corners, as the curves in the road are way too unrealistically sharp and tight.
- NPC Driven buses DO NOT stick to established bus routes, constantly and randomly changing direction and missing out bus stops all together.
- NPC buses stop at bus stops but don't let passengers off.
- Passengers heads and bodies clip thru vehicle bodies and roofs
- When it rains passengers are holding unfurled umbrellas INSIDE buses, which clip thru the walls of buses,
Similarly, when it rains, some pedestrians are holding their arms out as if holding an umbrella, but they're empty handed.
- NPC Buses stop at bus stops for FAR TOO LONG causing long lines of buses to gather up behind them.
- NPC Buses tend to stop for too long at junctions when there is no traffic, this also applies to other NPC traffic.
- NPC traffic appear to be unsure of whom has right of way at junctions and on/off ramps.
- Pedestrians are constantly stepping out in front of buses and traffic and paying no attention to the roads at all, this especially causes problems when driving yourself as colliding with a pedestrian incurs a costly penalty.
- NPC drivers don't appear to obey traffic lights, or pedestrian crossing lights.
- Pedestrians don't appear to observe or obey the ""walk / don't walk"" lights at cross walks.
- Crosswalks are often located in the most dire locations, such as right in front of a bus stop or even in some cases, right OVER a bus stop, yes you heard correctly, an actual crossing THRU a bus stop, GREAT civic management!
- Buses spawn out of thin air, in a stationary position even in the middle of highways.
- People drop thru bridges onto the streets below, or do a ""Mary Poppins"" and suddenly take off and fly thru the air. (this looks especially freaky when they're holding umbrellas) DEVS will you please fix this won't you? spit spot!
- On the town map, the detail is messy, confusing and unclear, with bus route colors too similar to other routes, making it impossible to clearly highlight a single route.
- When you customize your buses inside the paint shed, the lighting is poor and the shading is bad depending on the model of bus you're customizing, and decals are sometimes glitchy or broken.
- The route planner / designer is appallingly bad, way too basic and unworkable. You get a choice of ""loop OR ping pong""
- There is NO way to change the weather, when it rains (and it rains VERY often) the visibility is atrocious.
- Bus stops are all ""road side"" meaning they stop ON the road as opposed to pulling into a ""bay lane"" this causes an incredible blockage of traffic.
- Buses will wait an insurmountable length of time letting cars and trucks past them instead of pulling out when there is right of way, and they have an annoying habit of slowing down and stopping for no reason.
- The lanes and markings on the roads and junctions are inconsistent and unclear and at times completely devoid of markings, lines, lanes or signage, leaving you unsure of where you're supposed to be.
- There are often invisible obstacles on the roads or streets leading to unavoidable collisions.
- Bus stops are often too close together, and the world maps too small to operate large fleets. Journeys are way too short by distance, but too long time wise as buses stay too long at each stop.
- At present the so called ""bus station"" is nothing more than a glorified bus stop with only 2 stops. (I don't bother using it as buses tend to ""back up"" and / or get stuck on curve when entering or leaving the bus station (especially double deckers)
- The game frequently freezes (not crashes thankfully, at least not for me elseways) and sticks, the game becomes stuttery and ""janky"" especially when entering a high ""spawn in"" area of the map (despite my having a high 'spec' computer)
- Pedestrians appear to walk as if in VERY slow motion, and what's with some of the people walking in quick but tiny ""pin steps""? it takes them forever and an age to cross the 'dang' road! it's sooo annoying.

This list could go on forever, but I won't! For MOST of these ""issues"" fixes via regular updates SHOULD take care of the problem, but at this rate I don't think the DEVS (Developers) will EVER solve all the problems, it's disappointing and it makes the game damn well 'unplayable' and spoils the fun.
Is this what game designers do now? Create and sell a 'BROKEN' game to people for no small amount of dosh and then spend forever fixing it on the fly? For GOD's sake DEVS, GET your act together!
THIS JUST WON'T DO!
The last update they sent out has actually made things WORSE, now ALL my NPC buses are chock full of people STUCK in closed doors and arms, legs and heads sticking out of the bus."

Game is pretty good, but this game had lots of issues with bugs. Bugs luckily were fixed at ""Next Stop"" update.

-> Game is good for players which likes buses but I still think even after huge update game still missing some things. I wouldn't say it's down grade from 18 ANYMORE by ""Next Stop"" -Update, but still the game needs lots of optimizations. Game has lots of potential but game needs still content and few features.

Before ""Next Stop"" -update I couldn't recommend this game, but since this isn't anymore full of bugs this game is pretty good."
bus+simulator+21+next+stop,Recommended,372.1,"Posted: October 21, 2021
EDIT - updated review with Next Stop DLC

I'm glad to say a lot of the issues I had with the game have been addressed and I like the new extension. The buses appearing from thin air is still there and double deckers still get stuck in certain place. I am glad the they have got this into a playable state now but feel this is where the game should have been at release. Still I do enjoy the game now and hopefully more new areas will be added in the future.

So sad to have to leave a negative review but overall Bus Sim 21 is a major let down.
First the good points, the buses look great and are enjoyable to drive. Day to night cycle and weather is a nice addition.

However there are glaring bugs that ruin the experience for me. Firstly AI buses magically appear out of thin air on the map. You can see one is near you on the mini map then there's a flash and it appears stationary. It's so pathetic and this is 2021, I have a decent PC, why has the game been designed like this? It totally ruins the immersion for me.
The destination boards can't be edited like they could in BS 18, why has this been removed? Even the destination is wrong as it shows the next to last stop on the route.
The transit terminal is a waste of space, it's a huge building yet you can only use 2 bays. It's meant to be a central hub for god's sakes yet it's merely a glorified bus stop.

The map itself is too small and badly designed. You could literally drive from one end to the other in about 3 minutes. Im hoping there's going to be a substantial expansion at some point.

AI traffic waits at junctions too long and let's pedestrians cross all the time causing traffic to back up and make you late. AI buses block bus stops and stay too long meaning you can't drop off or pick up passengers causing you to be late and end up being out of hours.

Traffic lights turn green almost straight away, cars ignore red lights, there's no road markings at junctions so this causes confusion and tail backs.

Pedestrians still fall through bridges and this is nearly 2 months after release.

The liveries and decals are rubbish. The wraps look like they were made by a 3 year old and are awful and garish. Where's the custom liveries like in BS 18? Again this has been removed.

Buses getting stuck when negotiating corners. This happens frequently especially with the double deckers and causes traffic to back up.

So there you have it, a game I was so looking forward to and it's a major let down. I can't recommend it in this state and I wonder why they even released it like this.

I may revisit my review if the major issues I've highlighted are ever fixed but I doubt they will be.

So for now I'm steering clear of this game and suggest you do too"

Last updated: 27/10/2023

Props to the developers for continuing to update the game, the pace of updates has been slow sometimes but currently, despite the remaining - and some longstanding - glitches - it is an enjoyable game, especially with the school bus DLC and free map extension with more rural style areas, plus the Tram DLC and spin-off game to look forward to (making the Season Pass quite good value.)

Recent updates (since Next Stop):

- AI traffic has improved. They will now sound their horn back at you sometimes, and are more confident in overtaking you.
- The timetable has improved. You no longer have 3 mins between stops that are next to each other, and it is now more challenging to be on time - you can though, add time back in if you need it, but you will make less money.
- Some bendy buses back ends' seem to move when stationary and kneeling - that was also the case before the update.
- Some buses still have functional glitches, such as the diesel Grande West having broken windscreen wiper animations.
- The devs have listened and have tripled the number of usable stands at the Transit Terminal from 2 to 6, reducing congestion and making it look more like a proper bus station.
- The bus limit has been raised from 100 to 180, though note more buses = reduced FPS, especially when they all spawn nearby, so take care with this on low end PCs.

This means there is only ONE issue left from my original review: reused sounds. Most of the buses do not sound like they would in real life - they fixed it with the eCitaro, why not any other buses? The Enviros' especially are desperate for new sounds.

Current bugs:
- Most issues with AI has been fixed but some erratic behaviour remains - mainly with pedestrians running into buses or getting stuck in some locations
- School buses, as well as routes that peak at night, continue to run and stand at bus stops outside the times they should
- Some rain textures have been fixed but the wiping animation on some buses is not smooth, and is non-existent on others (the rain texture on the glass is just toggled instead)
- The increase in AI buses causes performance to drop significantly (previously around 60FPS, now 30-40. A large number of buses on screen at once causes stuttering on weaker hardware when graphics are high.)

Updated conclusion:
The graphical style, though slightly unrealistic is good enough to have you believe you are driving in a real My game is set to very high and performance is good in most areas with the exception of areas with a high AI bus density and busy ENVIROments. (sorry).
The fact you can just jump on a bus, check tickets and take over is really nice, and it is really pleasant to see your buses roaming around with passengers on.
The ""story"" is nice, although gets slightly repetitive near the end, I now enjoy just adapting my own routes and driving around.
And the buses themselves - there is a nice variety. The electric buses as well as the double-decker Enviro 500 are enjoyable to drive despite the reused Setra sounds on many buses. And the models are really detailed, the team responsible for those are amazing.

I think naming it Bus ""Simulator"" is probably backfiring slightly as those in the extreme simulation community (rightfully, to an extent) detest this game. If you see it as a Bus Game, with a balance between management and simulation, you will enjoy it far more.


Buy this if:
- It is not full price/you find it elsewhere at a discount
- You like route and timetable planning
- You enjoy company management
- You like customising buses
- Enjoy driving and are not overly concerned with accuracy of physics (they are not terrible, just more arcade like)
- You enjoy completing mini challenges and career progression (though a sandbox mode is available if not)

Avoid it if:
- You can't live with any bugs.
- You want a simulator with an emphasis on pure realism (especially sounds and physics) - check out The Bus, but loose economy or career features, and no AI buses, or OMSI, but get outdated graphics, expensive DLC, and numerous bugs if you can even get that ancient piece of software to run.
- You do not like cats, Winter of Passion, or Spring of Affection. Summer of Love coming soon to Disney-.

I must admit that when I saw all the negative reviews at launch I was put off and I must admit I was disappointed. But I figured I would keep an eye on the game. When I saw there was a bug fix that same day I saw hope. So yesterday I decided to grab the game at full price and I was not disappointed. I have not ran into any other major bugs and the game feels more open and alive then 18 did. As of today there was a 2nd bug fix. So far I am enjoying the game and can't wait to see where it goes."

It's a very nice game, with a bit of Unity-looking map (if you know what I mean, as it's not the most realistic map in the world). I can't compare it with Bus Simulator 18 as I have never played that game before. For a bus/public transport fan, this is a good game.

First, in general, this game is a really nice game to play.
Yet only in singleplayer, as the multi has too much bugs to be enjoyable. But bugs are a thing that we already know from Astragon and they'll get fixed some time in the future - we all know that.

General:
- I played in the closed Beta and the game has improved massively since then, just saying :)

Positives:
+ huge Map with much details - old Map (from BS2018) is playable too
+ new busses, some more recent, electro and cng but also the good old Citaros :) (and the Alexander Denis')
+ Open World Experience, theres no menu where you have to start from once you load into the game, you can start missions and routes while standing at a bus stop yourself and attend ur busses or smth
+ driving physics seem to be quite accurate, wheel support is good (controller aint I suppose)
+ Improved lightning and dynamic weather (compared to BS18 this is a huge upgrade, you had to start with ur desired weather and it stayed like that for the whole route)
+ ""Reallife"" Time - 1min ingame = 1min irl, you can skip time (so you dont have to wait half an hour for the next bus^^)
+ different land schemes and just the nice graphics from UE4 (or 5? xD) upgrade the game


Negatives:
- first the negatives are always the ones that get pointed out better than the positives, some of these listed below are just minor improvements that could be made but there are some major issues (in my opinion) too:

- AI: As was the case before, the AI is just bad. Of course it is difficult to get a AI working realistically, especially in complexe Traffic Scenarios, but in some situations, they just seemed to be ahead of themselves. They run over the street without any crosswalk or sign of recognizing the bus. The pathfinding under bridges is horrible - as has been the case in the beta in mid July (!!). And thats just the pedestrians, the AI Cars also seem to be pretty shy when it comes to priority on crossings: Ex.: You want to turn left onto a prioritized route with the cars on that travalling straight on - if you use ur left indicator they will just stop and not move anymore until you turn them off or turn - if you dont approach with indicator lights on they'll just ignore you and drive into you.

- ""Main Station"": Massive Downgrade from the 18s, there seemed to be a problem with the AI Busses picking the right of the 6 visual lanes pre-beta which led to them only opening 2 lanes. A Main Station with 2 Lanes? Like come on, even BS18 had 6.
- Graphics on rain (tho FPS are really stable, just the visuals suck especially on the main window) UPDATE: they patched so that the rain drops are actually visible on the main window until you turn on the wiper.
- Bus Stops: The Bus Stop signs are really close to the street - if you want to deliver ur passengers as closely to the sidewalk on Stops as possible, you have to avoid the signs which leads to not being able to close in realistically. Also the park position is kinda random, cant tell when it is perfect (for the game) and when just good etc... AI Busses stopping on Bus Stops are just 2 metres in the street when they spawn (passengers have to cross 2 metres to the sidewalk idk)
- Bus Spawning in general sucks: On the max visible range (setting) the AI Busses will spawn with lightning and in visual range, so there isnt a clean transition and they always spawn not moving (even in the middle of nowhere)

(these are the main issues I have while playing, they arent game breaking, but just thinks that make the experience much less enjoyable at least for me)


Fazit:
I like the game. Its great to chill, simulate bus driving but once you jump into multiplayer or try taking it a bit too realistic it gets annoying. Some ♥♥♥♥ just doesnt work the intended way, and the devs seem to get slower. Pre-launch and the first few weeks, the communication between Community and Devs was great but the discord is getting more quiet recently. So the game is great as long as you can see all the positives of being able to drive a functional bus etc. and just ignore bugs or make fun of it! I do recommend buying it still, just dont expect a perfect game - it is none."

This is not a simulator, it's a sandbox game with buses.

But even if you take the name forging away and take it for what it is, what the game is is still trash. I'm talking bugs, tons of bugs, so many bugs that I'm convinced the game has no testing team. I've only played this for around 6 hours and I've already encountered a lot of weird stuff. Wouldn't be so bad if you wouldn't be much affected by it, but because the way the game deducts you XP points and money for everything, most of the bugs end up punishing you. There's the smaller bugs like the game taking XP from you for driving against a one-way road or telling you you missed a stop, or you didn't let a passenger off even though you were standing at a stop with the doors open at the time. I've even had some people standing in the bus bay forcing me to a ""bad stopping position"" because I didn't run them over. These things are annoying and slowing down your progress. But the way worse bugs are like invisible objects and invisible pedestrians. Considering that running over a pedestrian instantly cost you 20 grand, if you get this early in the game like I did, it significantly pushes your progress back.

It's almost like the game doesn't want to be played, so it keeps putting you off until you surrender. But I'm going to play my money's worth out of it regardless, I ain't no quitter."

Graphics improved since Bus Simulator 18, but bus handling has not. Free-roam is a nice addition, but 3rd-person movement is janky and not good. Lots of optimization issues causing slowdowns. Needs a bit more time in the oven before a positive recommendation can be made."

EDIT #4 May 19th 2023:

So it has been a long time since I updated this. I was waiting for a major update to release.

I am now changing my recommendation to Yes.

All bugs that I have previously mentioned have been fixed.
They released a huge FREE update. I have to hand it to them for making the update free. It comes with a big map extension that would be DLC in other games.
It took them some time but they finally did it.

You can also play an extra mode that allows you to play the story and you can have everything unlocked. Or play Sandbox or Career and earn money to purchase more buses.

They also will release some cool DLC, like School Buses and driving a Tram.

So yeah buy this :)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EDIT No3. July 11th 2022:

I am close to changing my review to a positive one, but some issues still remain.

The good:

They have added new voice lines for the passengers.
The AI buses spawn in sooner as to not spawn on top of you.
Pedestrians no longer fall through bridges.

The bad:

It still takes stuck AI traffic 2 minutes to de-spawn. That's quite a delay to your schedule.
A new bug appeared with the 2nd last patch where passengers got stuck in the doorway of a full bus. The last patch aimed to fix that, but what it does is, when the bus is full and passengers want to get on, some other passengers then get off. But this takes time and creates a delay.

Once the passenger issue is fixed fully I will then change my review to positive.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EDIT 2: Apr 8th 2022:

I now have 182 of playtime and after today's patch there's no change and none of the issues have been fixed

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EDIT Mar 11th 2022:


I now have 156 hours of gameplay and after the latest patch, the bugs remain. I still don't recommend buying it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ORIGINAL REVIEW:

With almost 100 hours in the game I still cannot recommend it.

It was released with too many bugs and issues. Some bugs have been fixed but some bugs I am not sure that will be fixed due to the nature of them.

Coming from Bus Simulator 18 I had big hopes for this version as the devs were boasting about improved features. It has a great new map but it let down by the issues.

AI: We were promised improved AI but it seems to be just as bad. The AI will sit there waiting to turn when it has plenty of time but just sits there. But the AI has no problem turning into you when you have the right of way.

AI Passengers: Many of the passengers phrases have been recycled from Bus Sim 18. That's just being pure lazy.

Weather: It has dynamic weather which is great but you are unable to choose what weather you want to drive in. You can only fast forward time.

Map: New map, lovely map with many feature, from city center to the sea view. But in some parts of the map some buses become stuck when coming to a steep hill. Forcing you to reset the bus and drive very fast to ensure you do not get stuck. The new map has a bus depot but it not utilized fully. Why build a great feature that you can only use a quarter of it?

Bugs: The current bugs that I see are buses spawning on the map out of thin air and people falling through bridges onto the road below it.

Keys were sent out to playtesters but many bugs stayed on release, why? Is this the norm now, we buy broken games and just wait for bug fixes?

I enjoy the game but it frustrates me. If you own Bus Sim 18 then stick with that for the time being. As I said I enjoy the game but it's not fun when you get angry at it."

I have over 500 hours in Euro Truck Simulator 2 so I know what a simulator is.
I played this game for 2 hours and it is very boring and the controls are not a simulation either.
I've never done this before, but now I've asked for my money back."
bus+simulator+21+next+stop,Not Recommended,2.6,"Posted: January 7
I don't know how they managed to make this worse than the previous one but they did. Bus simulator 18 is really good. This one is really a step down. I do not recommend you to get this one at all.

So many weird bugs like ""You left a passenger behind"" but there was no passengers waiting. When you need to put out the ramp for a disabled person, if you are also kneeled you'll get an error message ""can't use ramp right now"" which I never experienced in the other game.

Summary: This game sucks get the 2018 one"

Review of the game (no bias) EN + RU text

EN:
I recommend this game to anyone that likes simulators and ready to wait for updates. I will present a list of pros and cons. I don't really understand why this game gets Mixed reviews
Pros:
+ A ton of content. (I think for about 40+ hours). I am playing this game for 6 hours already in one of two locations that you can choose. With all the missions taken I've opened about 30% of the map (bought bus stops and unlocked the parts of the map). Storyline is interesting and doesn't lack mission variety.
+ Graphics. In comparison to 18th part of the game it has better graphics, better antialiasing and look in general.
+ Missions. Instead of the system ""buy and own more, get more levels to unlock more things to buy"" you get a progression based on tasks and unlocks that make sense. (Example: missions before unlocking the island with tourist attractions you need to put ads (banners) on your buses to promote that island. Game characters say that is for your business' sake, but this action actually unlocks new story character with extra missions on the island based on your decision to promote it)
+ Customization. Game provides a good variety of buses. About tuning: you can change buses' color, decals, custom ones (you can put figures and stuff on the bus to make a pattern) and interior coloring


-
- Bugs (minor ones). As another game of Astragon you should expect bugs. However, Astragon is also a company that doesn't leave the game after the release and they fix all the major bugs frequently. Half of the bugs that I had were fixed within a week and some of them even hours after discovering them. The bug that is annoying now is that auto-disable of blinkers really sucks. They can be automatically disable too fast and you can get a fine because of them (here you can turn on red light if you are going not straight, but turning off blinkers gives you a fine, because game thinks that you've driven straight)

RU:
Рекомендую игру для покупки, если вы один из тех, кто любит симуляторы и готовы ждать обновы. Плюсы и минусы сейчас объясню. Не совсем понимаю отзывов этой игры.

+ В игре море контента (по моим подсчетам на часов так 40+). Играю шестой час в карьеру в одной из двух локаций. С учетом прогрессии я открыл и обустроил примерно 30% карты. Прокачка интересна и разнообразна.
+ Графика. По сравнению с 18-ой частью - графика получше. Лучше сглаживание и картинка в целом.
+ Миссии. Вместо системы ""покупай, затем открывай новое, чтобы купить"" у вас будет система квестов и наград, которые имеют смысл и взаимосвязаны. (Пример: перед разблокировкой острова с туристическими аттракционами у вас будет миссия заехать в покрасочную и нацепить рекламу этого острова и его достопримечательностей, что кроме прибыли за рекламу разблокирует вам и остров, так как на вас выйдет персонаж с этого острова, который продолжит линейку квестов)
+ Кастомизация. Выбор автобусов хороший. Из настроек: цвет, раскраски (декали), реклама, раскраска салона и свои фигуры (сами расставляем)
+ Хорошая русификация, однако войс на английском, субтитры норм качества


-
- Баги. (несущественные). Играя в игру от Астрагонов вы должны ожидать от нее багов. Но и по той же причине, что игра от них вы и можете ожидать то, что баги фиксят, а игру не бросают. Большинство багов, что я встречал, были пофикшены уже через неделю или даже считанные часы после их обнаружения. Из тех багов, что сейчас есть - поворотники, а именно система их автоматического выключения и он меня бесит. Они часто выключаются слишком рано. По ПДД этой игры можно поворачивать на красный при условии, что вы именно поворачиваете, а не едете прямо, но из-за того, что баг выключает поворотник, то игра наказывает вас штрафом, думая, что вы ехали на красный, хоть вы и соблюдаете ПДД

PS.
EN: I like this game. I was hesitant at first because of the Mixed reviews. However, when I've bought it I enjoyed my experience.
RU: Мне нравится эта игра. Я сначала не собирался ее покупать из-за смешанных отзывов. Однако, когда я ее все же купил, то мне понравилось"

I have played about 200h of bus sim 18 on PS4. It was one of my favourite games on the console hence why I was really excited to wait for this after crossing over to PC. After having waited about a year and playing the game for just under an hour. I can say I'm gutted and sad :/ The game is badly optimised, not playable and broken. I can appreciate that it has only just released however the game is not finished nor playable for £29.99. I'll consider paying again when it's finished. Very disappointing..."

I have in this game more than 40 h and that's why I decided to write this opinion. I will recommend this game but there is some problem.
So lets start with...
I give this game 6.5/10. Why?
Gameplay
So starting with gameplay. Gameplay is very relaxing and interesting for players that like simulators. You can create your our bus company with your own created routes. You have huge selection of buses.
Here I cut points in my opinion. NPC like to bug in buses and in game you losing points because of skipped stop ---> they want leave the bus but they cant.
Map:
You have 2 maps (American and Europe). Here I cut points. Maps advantages are that map is huge and very fitted to gameplay with lots of bus stops. Disadvantages: Maps quality is not like: ""OMG *You fall from chair* "" - there is a lot of buuged textures.
I think that game is good but should and can be better."

I had been looking forward to this game for such a long time! But it saddens me to be leaving this negative review on a franchise I love. And it pains me to say this will be my first game i'll be refunding, I didn't pay $54.45 for a game i won't pick up again.

I had such high hopes for this game but they fell short. The controls of the bus are so sensitive that even after messing with the controls it still is horrible to drive. I'd try and turn a corner and i'd end up off the road. Cars were pulling out in front of me and crashing into me when I had right of way.

When I tried to change my seat height it straight up didn't work. I pushed all the buttons but nothing was changing. I even tried changing the buttons to something else but alas it still didn't work.

I also encountered a lot of glitches with the clothing on the larger body female. All but 1 of the tops glitched through the pants and the larger body female isn't able to wear a mask either? What's that about??

I honestly think the game is a downgrade from Bus Sim 18.. I can see what they were trying to do but as the saying goes
''If it ain't broke, don't fix it'' and that's how I feel about aspects of this game. The game honestly feels unfinished or unpolished.. Like a a dish that's cooked on the outside but once you get into it you realise it's not cooked in the middle."

I played bus sim 18 a lot and i loved the game.
So i had high hopes for bus sim 21.
Its a disapointment for me, the game and graphics looks great, but the game itself just inst worth it.
De new american map is good, but the european map is the same map as in 18, with no expantion or anything.
Also the creation of routes is complicated and easier and better workin on 18.
The menu also sucks.
if the game had the interface and menu and map and mission system from 18, aad the graphics, busses and map of 21 then you have a good game.

It doesnt happen a lot, but i must say they made a good game worse with 21.

If you dont have 18 then you shoud buy this one i guess, but if you already have 18 then buying 21 is a waste of money."

This is a really good game. It's fun, it's relaxing, and it's enjoyable, which is pretty much what you want from a game. OK, is it challenging? No, not really. There are degrees of difficultly you could set for yourself, but if you just like driving buses, it's up there. And, for what it's worth, I think the European map is more enjoyable than the American one, but you can decide that. They each have their merits. The passengers are equally annoying, whichever map you choose!

YouTubers will tell you, ""but this is no 'OMSI'"", and they're right. This is no OMSI. And that's not a bad thing. If you want a 32-bit never-to-be-meaningfully-updated-crash-here-and-there-usually-here-AND-there-with-quirks-when-not-crashing bus simulator, stutters thrown in for good measure, and not to mention Dulux-white painted cars (drats be them 32 bits), and have some cash on the hip, get OMSI! If you want a relaxing game to play, instead of a course in bus-engineering, get Bus Simulator 21.

I do have a couple of complaints with this game, though. Foremost is its handling of TrackIR, of which its handling of is rubbish. If you've ever used TrackIR, you'd understand. Unlike other games (e.g. ETS2, ATS, FS22) which handle it really well (FS22 FTW on that (FS being Farming Simulator, not Flight Simulator!)), BS21 (BS being Bus Simulator, not the other thing) handles it really badly. There's no obvious way (if any) to reset or pause it. I've crashed many a bus while trying to get TrackIR where it needs to be, wiggling my headphones around like a crazy person. Game's fault, not TrackIR's fault (because TrackIR is brilliant).

My second complaint is about braking. I've fiddled with the settings, but for love nor money can I get a bus to stop by pressing the brake pedal like a normal person would (full disclosure, I'm using the Logitech G923, where the brake pedal is dodgy at best, but works fine in other games (the pedals are accompanied by a rather fine steering wheel, no complaints in that department)). You have to kind of pump them like you're a drummer in a rock band. It's a quirk, you get used to it, but somewhat annoying. It rather detracts from the natural experience of accidentally hitting lampposts or other objects of interest.

As an aside, if you play games (where TrackIR is supported) and you move your ""head"" using the mouse or keyboard, you need to get TrackIR. Without this sounding like a sponsored Ad, once you've used it, you'll never not want to not not use it. If my washing machine broke tomorrow and my TrackIR broke tomorrow, I'd get another TrackIR. I still have a sink, after all.

Diversion aside. Good game.

That's my considered opinion. Take it or leave it!"

I know every version of this game from other years, and I'm sorry to see it descend towards total simplicity and kitsch. Setting the realistic mode still misses the realism and the game is completely arcade. Let's start with the negatives that will keep me from recommending the game...

MAPS:
- wide and repetitive streets,
- predetermined stops,
- different stops for tram and bus,
- repeatability of the map construction scheme that these are districts from A to Z,
- no random events, e.g. an accident or road repair,
- by force, without any changes in the road layout, tram rails were inserted, in addition, without the required supply traction,
- signaling adapted to the bus despite the lack of detectors or the ITS system, it just changes ""for me"",
- always the same obstacles, e.g. holes on the road or speed bumps, but no usual unevenness on the roads, which are not obstacles for the bus to ""feel the road"" a bit,
- lack of diversification of the map with rich/poor places, lack of creating a city (one decent city) and neighborhoods, not districts located from each other by the distance of a bridge, tunnel or suburban road,
- the WORST thing about the maps is the island, I haven't seen such a tragic performance of roads, objects, paths, vegetation (also in asphalt) for a long time.

UI:
- buying buses, switching between them or modifying them to be identical to the previous ones... it's nasty, unintuitive, confusing,
- too many hints, too many.

AI:
- too much favor of cars towards the bus, especially at intersections, it is a real extortion by the bus if it happened,
- waving waiting people at the bus stop? Even on request, this is not done in the direction of the bus
- the WORST thing about AI is asking you to stop mid-ride to release a passenger... it's actually illegal to do that outside of a stop.

THE REMAINING:
- poor driving physics,
- and no influence of the weather on driving,
- candy game graphics,
- selling tickets or passengers like to hang up,
- strange parameters of some buses (the smaller one has more seats...),
- no variety of passengers, only healthy and adult people or only on wheelchair, no passengers running to the bus, no drunk passengers,, no prams with a baby,
- no boards with timetables at stops (upper levels),
- no option to modify buses with additional things, such as LED boards, ticket machines, better seats, wi-fi, air conditioning, etc.
- no possibility to use the line setting as a loop so that people constantly exchange and not as a ""last stop"" and suddenly they get off and there are no new ones,
- a lot of good things from previous parts have been taken away in favor of bizarre ideas, either the creators drive cars or they are not even interested in buses, no passion.

I am very disappointed."

Braking and Reverse bound to the same axis. I was under the assumption that it would have settings that catered a bit more towards wheel/pedal setups as it has ""Simulator"" in the title. I can't even just shift between D/N/R. Completely ruins the immersion that i look for in a simulator style game. Within the first hour it became tedious and frustrating and that's just not fun at all."

Pros:
- Simple to learn
- Multiplayer
- Decent graphics
- A good amount of buses to choose from
- Manage your own bus lines and fleet
- Devs give a decent amount of updates every year

Cons:
- There are some very annoying bugs occasionally
- Some very cringe worthy one liners are being said by NPC's
- All buses sound and feel the same
- No Steam Workshop integration, Mods.io is there but is less attractive

Conclusion:

If you're looking for a true simulator, this is not it. OMSI2 or The Bus is maybe more what you're looking for. But if you're looking for a more relaxing and simple gaming experience, this is the game for you. Although there are some very annoying bugs, I think the amount of content that's available outweighs those bugs. The developers also keep expanding on the game and are providing good free content. The DLC's are decent, I would however recommend you only buy the bus packs and not the interior packs. There are mods available for good interiors through the integrated Mods.io platform. It's a shame they didn't use Steam Workshop though as a lot of people playing this game don't want to make mods for the Mods.io platform.

You can also play this game with friends and it is really enjoyable. You don't constantly have to sit behind a steering wheel, you can also just go out of your cabine and walk through the bus like an actual person. You can also throw some ticket inspections so passengers don't get to travel without paying.

And the roadmap last of all for this game is great. They are releasing a huge update very soon, expanding the map. They will also add very cool DLC in the future like School Buses and Trams."

Edit as of 9/2/2023:

From my ""netural"" review back in FEB of 2022, I have to say I recommend it. While the Ai is still quite buggy and terrible it could be improved, however the controls and keybinds seem to have been improved and its great now. FPS is also much better in my experience. So, I have changed my review to a recommended stance.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is going to be like a netural review since a lot happened since the day of release with this game being kind of a mess. There were a lot of bugs and other issues that were found that people were reporting on. One of the biggest for me was that you could not bind any buttons from like a steering wheel or in my case a custom built button box as neither of these equipment I own would not register in game at all upon release as a button or function so I stopped playing it for a bit as that was a major drawback for me.

However, fast forward to now I see that Astragon has pushed out an update addressing quite a number of issues and they seem to have fixed for the most part the programming of buttons to assign them differently. The gameplay overall, seems to have been improved a bit but there is still bugs that exist. FPS is ok in some areas, but in some instances its like all over the place depending on where I am on the map. Even though there are issues and bugs that still exist I hope more is done to update and improve this game overtime. The new Bus Models are a nice edition as well. Even with its current issues ill still play it from time to time, but I would still recommend picking up bus sim 18 instead as even though that title has issues not as bad as this one, it seems to be better than this overall."

I can't fully recommend this game....yet.

The simulation aspect is good, as a bus driver myself, the game does good job with that part, however, my issues lie with the AI. The pedestrians constantly cross in front of you when you have a green light, the AI cars sit at the green lights and will not move, and I have noticed my other buses will sit at a bus stop and never move.

Speed bumps? Why are there speed bumps? The only time I see speed bumps is in residential areas, not in downtown cores.

Also, the ""out of hours"" logic makes no sense, being late for a stop does not put you ""out of hours"" from a driving sim standpoint there's no logic there."

I've never written a review but the amount of hate this game has gotten being only released 10 hours ago, has it been a bit buggy? Yes it has, but I haven't encountered half the bugs these negative reviews list, a hot fix is out which I haven't tested yet but I actually find the game quite enjoyable and relaxing, I find it's an improvement from 18, I absolutely love how you can choose to continue a route without having to reload cause in 18 it would force you to go back to the selection screen
It was a bit confusing trying to figure everything out in the beginning but that could also just be because of my mental issues but once I figured it all out it I've been enjoying it"

Well. It's a great game. Though there are some bugs and funny and annoying things but in general the game is very good playable. It's soothing, if you take your time while driving. I do not have a lot of issues with the steering wheel, Thrustmaster TX, although there is no force feedback which is a shame. Graphics are nice, pedestrians sometimes scare you and sometimes cars just drive like idiots, but most of the time the traffic is decent to you as a bus driver. I hope the developers continue fixing bugs, because in the end that means the game will become better. So, if you expect a bug free game, no. If you expect some nice and great playing time, yes."

Bus Simulator 21
A fun and addictive bus simulator, in an impressive environment, with a lot of replay value. There are some noticeable glitches and anomalies but they don’t mar the overall experience.

Bus Simulator 21 is the third PC installment of the franchise developed by Stillalive studios and published by Astragon entertainment.

This version of the simulator builds on Bus Simulator 18 with thirty licensed buses to drive adding Volvo, Alexander Dennis, Scania, BYD, Grande West, and Blue Bird to the list.

You can now drive a double decker bus and e-buses on the two extensive maps located in the US or Europe in either single player or co-operative multiplayer, along with managing your fleet and organizing timetables.

There are four different difficulty levels with various features you can choose such as speeding fines, speed bumps and speed limiters; pot holes; disability ramp access; automatic kneeling and ticket collection, along with various assists to steering, breaking and acceleration. There are a number of ways you can tailor the game to match your wishes.

The environments were incredibly detailed and lively. I didn’t really appreciate how intricate they were until I started running around for the collectibles, which were fun and challenging to hunt. The maps are very large but somehow, they have managed to add so much variety to the different locales, each having their own personalities and character. I was forever stopping to admire the view and appreciate the different sounds. The character movements were a little odd at times, some moving slow like they had soiled themselves, and taking an eternity to walk over crossings! There are some comical moments with graphical glitches and bizarre physics, usually involving accidents. These only happened very occasionally however.

The traffic AI was reasonably good I thought. Automobiles drove around as expected in the main, although there were occasions when cars would take an absolute age to make turns.

Driving the different kinds of buses was fun. I preferred playing in third person view with the bus showing as I drove, although with larger buses it was difficult to see whether your indicators were flashing or not, which resulted in some accidents. I had to turn off the NPC voices as they were amusing at first but then got annoying, especially when trying to concentrate on planning routes. It is quite easy to build up time and if you go over three minutes ahead you need to stop and wait a while or else it is considered “out of hours”.

There is a basic tutorial which provides a quick rundown of how to operate the bus but the management side of things is hardly explained at all. The campaign mode does act as a type of tutorial but often it left me asking questions on the Discord channel to fill in the gaps. The tutorials need a bit of work, and if you are a newcomer to the series, it can leave you frustrated trying to manage your fleet, organize routes and time tables. Once I got the grasp of things though I started to enjoy the game more and it became very enjoyable.



You can customize your character with the usual attire and looks, and even wear a proper uniform.

The sandbox mode lets you operate in any area with any bus. Everything is unlocked for you to play with. You can customize your bus with various decals and ride buses which would normally take you hours to unlock.

The multiplayer mode means you can set up with three other friends or players online, and work co-operatively to run your business. Set up some routes and have your friends drive the bus or ride the bus with them acting as conductor. I had no issues with connection or finding a game to join. It was quite fun but I’d imagine it would rely on people being sensible as crashing the bus would cost the owner money in repairs.

Some of the collectibles were extremely hard to find but I had a lot of fun doing so. Collectibles resemble a luminous green bus. There are twenty to find on each map along with a couple of SAM statues and even a haunted house.

The main game is campaign or mission based where you follow a story of sorts which teaches you how to run your business. You will need to learn how to set up routes to meet certain criteria set out for you. For example, you may need to connect three districts in a balanced route, or upgrade a district to level two. Each bus stop has a level and by using that stop you gain experience points. Earn enough experience points and you can upgrade the stop. Upgrade all stops in that district to raise the district level. Each stop either weighs in favor of passengers departing or entering at that stop, denoted by a blue or purple color. To balance the route, you would need to have an equal number of blue and purple stops.

There is some strategy involved in the game. It’s not all about driving buses. The route planning can be quite technical with day and night cycles, peak times, and planning efficient routes. Some of the missions can be quite time consuming and there are thirty or more on each map.

Positive marks are rewarded for good driving, like using your indicators correctly, and reaching stops on time, and negative marks are given for accidents, improper use of indicators and speeding, for example. Each stops earns you XP until you reach a new level which earns you a pay day. Money can be used to buy new buses, and to help with business costs.
Gradually you will have a few buses running different routes you set up, all collecting money for you to buy more expensive buses i.e., electric or CNG.

The bus can be operated in first or third-person view. The seat can be adjusted and regular controls are mapped to your gamepad and the rest selected by using a wheel. There are various distractions for you to deal with like issuing tickets, waking up sleeping passengers, warning commuters who are listening to loud music, asking them to unblock entrances and asking for their tickets. All these options can be adjusted or turned off however.

The driving can be as realistic as you wish and weight and inertia plays a part. Once you get used to it, the driving feels satisfying.



I was incredibly impressed by how much detail and variety went into the environments. Just little things like inflatables in the swimming pool or packets of crisps in the news stand all made it feel so real. It was a pleasure to explore.

The buses looked nice and the interiors looked realistic.

There are some noticeable repetitions especially in character’s faces which could be improved.

I loved the bus sounds. They sounded very realistic and soothing.

I was particularly impressed with environmental sounds like cranes and boats near the docks and birds singing in the parks. It made the area come alive."

It's a good game compared to previous editions 2016 and 2018. That said, a lot of progress is still needed to emerge alongside other bus simulation games like OMSI 2 or The Bus.

Many minor bugs spoil the gaming experience:
- The headlights of NPC vehicles are for some non-functional.
- Crowds of NPCs on the bridge north of the Westfield Corners stop.
- The rear headlights (brake lights) are not functional on the IVECO Urbanway: They remain either on or off but there is no link with the braking.
- NPC buses have their headlights on during the day in bright sunlight.
- NPC hair is bugged by being flash or incorrect colors.
- When getting on the bus, the NPCs are slow and go through the doors when they are open.
- The front door of the IVECO Urbanway has a bar at the top which is useless because it opens in a vacuum: it must be connected to the bus.
- The ramps fixed to the rear interior doors of IVECO Urbanways are unnecessary since the doors open to the outside."

has a US city as its main map, has ZERO buses used in the US. the US city looks almost nothing like a real US city and for some reason there are crosswalks every 50 feet which is not only unrealistic but also tends to be frustrating to deal with. the main ""transit terminal"" is gigantic for no reason, it looks more like an airport (but isnt) and has only TWO LANES for buses, who thought this was a good idea??? some car models do not have tail lights and also cars tend to just stop and sometimes not move and block the road. in chinatown i had npcs walk into the side of my bus twice a few seconds apart as i approached a bus stop, something on the sidewalk was pushing them into the street yet i was penalized $40K. a lot of the bus stops are way too close together in my opinion.

btw i found a mod that adds 1 US bus, but one of the main game updates broke most of its functionality. after scrolling through the mod comments i learned that the devs wont update the mod kit so the modder cant fix any of the problems with the bus.

there is a lot of stuff that needs fixing, tweaking and straight up changing that will probably never be done."

Two years on from its release and many updates later, this game is still riddled with bugs and problems which make it an incredibly frustrating experience overall. Some of the updates have actually made things worse instead of better, which is such a shame because this could and should have been a great game.

The positives: the collection of buses is diverse and a huge step up from Bus Sim 18. There are the brilliantly speedy electric buses which are a pleasure to drive and, at long last, a double decker is included (but only one). The base game's total of 31 buses has gradually increased to nearly 50 with various DLC packs, an enormous improvement. Customisation of buses is also better with many more wraps and decals to select, although I would have liked a livery designer. The biggest improvement of all lies in the open-world nature of the game instead of returning to the menus after each drive, along with a 24-hour cycle. This is a superb innovation and makes the game far more immersive.

However, if the developers stepped up their game in some areas, they let things slide badly in others. In trying to cram a host of new features into the game, they forgot the most important element: the driving. Bus Sim 21 is simply nowhere near as good as Bus Sim 18 in a number of ways when it comes to driving the buses. The main problems are the terrible AI of both cars and pedestrians, unrealistic steering, the lack of comprehensive wheel support and a weak new map. Disabled passengers don't make it clear when they wish to alight, meaning you fail to put the ramp down and get penalised for 'skipping a stop'. Lost valuables are often impossible to retrieve due to the awful 'use this seat' function which also makes ticket checks a right pain.

The AI is appalling and has been since day one. Traffic crashes into your bus on a regular basis whilst attempting dangerous overtakes and naturally you are the one fined each time this happens. I've also lost count of the number of cars that have pulled out in front of me at junctions. The pedestrians are an abomination, from the fact some look like they are walking through treacle to the hilariously bad 'totter' animation of the old ladies. Much worse, however, is their behaviour on crossings: they think nothing of stepping out and running into the side of your bus. It happens time and time again and is maddening. More than once the developers have claimed this issue has been fixed but arguably it has got worse.

Passenger dialogue is another major disappointment. Using largely the same voice actors is bad enough, but to include all the already incredibly tired one-liners from Bus Sim 18 is unforgivable. If you've played that game, you'll know the most annoying lines: 'Marbles', 'Gruyere' and the Beethoven 'joke' - and they're all here and repeated just as often. The sound balancing of the dialogue is poor, too: the old woman from Bus Sim 18 with possibly the most irritating voice I've ever heard is much louder than the others whilst some of the new ones are too quiet. I could only stomach a couple of hours of hearing the same old guff together with new annoying lines before this was turned off.

The new map, Angel Shores, is disappointing with its sanitised, Fantasyland interpretation of San Francisco and a collection of tiny, dull, unrealistic streets. It feels small overall and even smaller than its European counterpart, Seaside Valley, also included with the game and much the better of the two. There's nothing wrong with a fictional city setting per se, but how much better would it have been if they had opted for one larger map that actually felt like a real city? Unfortunately, Seaside Valley comes with its old campaign so it is like replaying Bus Sim 18 but with worse AI and many more frustrations.

Another problem since the Next Stop update is a lack of time to actually enjoy driving the routes. They drastically cut the time allowed between stops meaning that unless you drive like a bat out of hell and turn off almost all the random events, you're not going to stay on time on some routes. There have been three updates since Next Stop came out and this has not been addressed.

The last major frustration is with the clunky interface. I've had trouble rebinding keys, setting up routes and changing general settings due to the menus refusing to co-operate at various times. It's a shambles.

If you're interested in a bus driving game then Bus Sim 18 is the one you want. This game is unrefined and far more frustrating to play, which is a massive shame. I'd love to change this review to recommended and will do so should some genuine game-changing updates materialise. The potential for a fantastic bus driving game is there, but now two years since it was released, it doesn't seem likely, does it?"

Bus Simulator 2021, a review

I played Bus Sim 18 and loved it, so when I heard that 21 was coming out I was immensely excited and counted down the days to release. Unfortunately, launch didn't appear to go too well, and I was put off buying the game at its hefty £29.99 price tag due to the innumerable negative reviews. However, after a few days of debating myself, I decided to bite the bullet and part with my hard earned cash. What a good choice that was.

The new map, Angel Shores, is quite massive, and I'm generally a fan. The detail is exquisite, the place feels alive, and though I haven't unlocked the entire map yet, I particularly like the suburban sprawl of Greenwood and the gorgeous stretch of road in Cayote Bush. It is quite diverse overall, and the American setting is a nice change from the usual German environment we see in so many simulators. That said, it's not without its faults. There are certain buggy areas (most notably one where pedestrians just fall of a bridge and onto the road in Greenwood), and performance takes a hit in certain regions. I also found the really chunky road markings a bit off-putting at first, though these may be the real Californian markings, so it's probably just personal preference. The colours also feel maybe a bit too vibrant which reduces immersion somewhat. Furthermore, despite not being colour blind and never had any colour vision issues, I find it next to impossible to distinguish traffic light colours, having to rely on the position of the light. These are minor issues though, overall, it's a very nice map to drive in, and really good job Still Alive, it's one of the best I've ever seen in any simulator, they just need to iron it out a bit.

As for the buses, well there's so much variety. The models are all round fantastic, and many of the buses carried over from 18 have been spruced up noticeably (The Urbanway is a work of art!), albeit with the odd exception of the Citaro K. The buses all have their own unique feel to them, they drive differently, and sounds are generally good, though there is a sizeable portion of the same old default sounds from 18 on a few buses, but this is understandable given the year that this was developed in! And the electric buses! They sound really incredible to my unaccustomed ears and that acceleration is quite the game-changer. Possibly my favourite thing about the new buses is that we finally have some decently comfortable interiors, or if not we can change them to that way! Oh, which brings me to the customisation. It's quite a bit better than 18, though I'm not a fan of how hard it is to write text on your bus side, and I long for the return of the toggle to remove wraps from bus windows, I hate it when they cover them. The buses are great, but new sounds for buses that don't have unique ones would be really welcome when the devs can next record them.


- The old map has been touched up a little bit, I enjoyed driving round it in the new buses, and I'll probably replay the story after I finish Angel Shore's
- On the old map you get access to the airport DLC area even if you didn't own it in 18!
- Sadly though, performance is substantially worse than in Bus Sim 18. In 18, I had the graphics set to ""High"" all round and got a solid, perpetual 75 fps. Now, I have them on Medium-Low and still get 75, but there are frame drops to the low 50s in many parts of the map, American or European.
- I at first found the new steering system really horrible, but you do get used to it after a few hours, it's just different to 18.
- The ai is generally improved, I am a big fan of how it actually now overtakes you when you're at a stop, and on the pedestrian side of things, they actually show some signs of intelligence and wait for you to pass before crossing the road, or hurry up a bit if you're approaching. I'd always try and let them cross of course, but in 18 I found they had no tolerance for high speeds and emergency braking was often necessary, upsetting the passengers.

To conclude, yes I recommend Bus Simulator 21. Is it flawed, yes. Is it worth £29.99, for me yes, but it is a lot of money and I'm sure others may disagree. But if you're sitting on the fence as I was, I'd say go for it, this is a very fun game. The first two hours are not very fun if you're used to 18, and as I hit that 2 hour threshold I had a sleepless night thinking about whether to refund it, but I decided to keep it, and after about 3 hours (I think someone else remarked on this) the game truly does come into its own. Thank you for reading!"

Update: There's still a lot of bugs, visual and other, but the developers are working on patching those bugs. They've got a long way to go, and the game play is pretty grindy to get really low-level unlocks like paint colors, something I hope will be worked out with the Next Stop release.

Lots of bugs, many feel like they should have been caught long before this game was released. I'm actually writing this after the game hard-crashed to the desktop. With the game being out for so long now, I'm amazed it's still as buggy as it is. If you put your hazards on while a turn signal is on, the signals just go nuts on the dashboard. Many buses don't have their headlights configured correctly (Mercedes Citaro and MAN). Pedestrians will stand inside of your A pillar and if you move the bus you'll be fined $20,000 for hitting a pedestrian. The wraps/ads are absolutely hideous, and you're required to put an ad on one of your buses. I made the mistake of putting it on the MAN, and the ad repeated on absolutely every glass surface except the windshield, it was obviously a glitch.
There are some nice aspects to the game, such as the ""always moving"" simulation where just because you're not driving the bus doesn't mean it isn't running a route, but with how many bugs there are, and how little effort the game developers have made at fixing them, I can't recommend this game right now."

Regardless of the driving experience, I am dissatisfied with the limit on the number of vehicles. It is too contradictory that the route number has been expanded to three digits with the total number of buses strictly limited to 100. Is that how you are innovating the BS18 bus company operating rules?

In this case, my vehicle can only meet the needs of about thirty lines. As a player who prefers operating companies and designing routes, this is a total disaster.

However, the magnificent new map and the reformed route design system, electric buses and new brand-authorized buses are indeed impressive. But considering the aforementioned problems and the huge number of bugs in the game, it is still difficult for me to give a good comment. ：(

Glad to see the limit got expanded to 180 with hundreds of bugs fixed, cannot wait for the coming DLCs :D"

So far, so... buggy. This game feels like an early release. Controls are lousy, and the turning radius of some of the buses makes it hard to drive... even though these same models were fine in Bus Sim 18. The AI pedestrians seem very jumpy, to the point where it's kinda entertaining. While the graphics are good, I don't understand why the roads are so wide - the tighter roads of Bus Sim 18 are a nice challenge.

Now let's talk performance... oh my... I was experiencing WILD FPS FLUCTUATIONS. It went from 80FPS to 47 within seconds, with no apparent reason why. I am able to play other games with quite frankly better graphics, with more stable, higher FPS. Even if I lower the resolution, I do still get some occasional stutters. Just bad performance all around, which was initially an issue with Bus Sim 18 as well, so hopefully this will get fixed.

In general there's a lack of polish. The rain animations on the windshield look pixelated and static (water doesn't run down the window as expected), and the cash register interactions are weird; some passengers just don't collect their change. Perhaps they just want to support the new bus system... II don't know. The interface seems unnatural and clunky, and makes Bus Sim 18 seem much more streamlined.

In general, Astragon really should've given this game more time in the oven. I did feel the same way about Bus Sim 18 as well, although it wasn't quite as bad. It's disappointing, because there's so much potential in this game, and it is relatively fun even with the issues. However, I recommend just waiting for the patches to come, or at least, for a sale. This isn't worth $35+ for the time being."

Bus Simulator 21 Review:

Its a Great Game for People who have no idea how to drive a bus and want to experience what its like but for pros this feels like childs play here are my pros and cons and feedback

Pros:
Few More New Manufactuers
More Control over Bus Management
Buses actually Follow the Routes and you can takeover any bus at anytime
Bus Dealership & Depot
More Freedom
Electric Buses
New Livery

Cons:
Recycled Sounds used from Bus Simulator 21
Recycled Decals
No Add to Other Buses Feature meaning you have to do the same repaint over and over again
Nightmare Steering in the Enviro 500
Terrible Brakes
No Option to Turn off Wraps on the Windows

Feedback:
I think the steering could be improved on the Enviro 500 bus as ive tried to manuever corners multiple times and its just not possible without reversing, Hopefully the Modding Community step up and bring bus more buses as some of the buses in the game Bore Me The Sounds as Astragon have already said were hard to get because of the Global Pandemic which is going on right now which is Fair Enough but they could of atleast tried another alternative line improvised sounds or something, the wraps are ok but i wish they had an Option so you could turn off Wraps on the Windows as its a very annoying issue


Overall i like this game and do reccomend it but theres alot of improvements that need to be done with it"

Total buggy, glitchy mess. Passengers/pedestrians/NPCs are badly animated and behave erratically. Traffic has little AI and behaves erratically. Controls often don't work. In general feels like an early access release. Have refunded.

Loved the previous games 16 & 18 and had high hopes for this. I have never refunded a game before but I just couldn't justify paying full price for this thrown together mess. I'd have been a bit miffed if it was early access but for a full release it's awful.

I'm guessing most of the reviews are from sim enthusiasts and I can see there reasoning behind many of there negative reviews. But as a casual sim gamer, this is a MASSIVE upgrade from bus sim 18. We now have more buses, the maps are massive, more npcs which say a lot more then THE OLD SAW MILL, more character customizations, more bus designs, many more bus stops, a 24 hour clock, better weather effects and bus timetables. I do however agree that every bus has the same audio which is something they could improve on and when using controller, the camera settings in first person are annoying as whenever I turn my camera moves slightly as well and it is impossible to reposition (so I have been driving in third person up to now). Overall though a massive improvement on bus sim 18 and I have had a lot of fun playing this so far!"

The game has quite a few issues and just isn't worth its money:
- The performance is horrible, even with modern hardware on low settings
- The game is full of bugs and glitches, especially in pathfinding and animation
- The physics are very bad and extremely unrealistic
- Missing translations/localization in a few different situations
- A very annoying tutorial on a laggy map which doesn't seem to be skippable

For a SIMULATOR with such a high price tag I expected more, way more, at the very least from the physics behaviour. But whenever hitting the sidewalk a bit, the bus bounces into the air, clamps to 45 degree max rotation and hits the ground like a falling stone and acts like nothing ever happened. The bus also has instant acceleration and braking in all directions and a very unrealistic behaviour in general.

The performance problems are also worth mentioning. Turning the graphic settings to medium gives about 50-60 FPS with occasional drops to 20-30 on a mobile RTX 3070 (130W) GPU and a well cooled Ryzen 7 5800H CPU. (FullHD resolution, 100% scale, Vsync disabled, NVMe SSD)

The only positive thing is the included multiplayer mode, which sadly has its limitations as well. (Lags, limited to 4 players only, turning your save file permanently into an online session)"

This is in a worse state now than it was when it launched. It was bad then but seems terrible now. I played initially for a couple of weeks at launch then gave up to come back at a later date when I naively thought the bugs and errors would have been fixed. Tried it again and have now found that some of the controls on the keyboard need pressing twice before they respond. There also seems a glitch when offloading a wheelchair user. Pressing G brings up an error message saying there is an obstruction.....despite trying several solutions I cannot see any obstruction. Occasionally you stop perfectly at a passenger stop yet the bus seems to collide with the stop sign. Does it jump out into the street or something?? AI cars have a mind of their own and pedestrians seem suicidal, though to be fair that last point is quite accurate in real life.
I also had to rebind my Thrustmaster steering wheel twice before it would work properly. I can't say how disappointing this is. I really enjoyed BS18, (even though that had it's issues) but felt it was tired and needed a more modern update. Sadly this isn't an update at the moment but more of a downdate!"

The devs might have wanted to use the ""Early Access"" feature of Steam, the game launched with quite a few game breaking bugs, I had to manually set the launch options to force DirectX 11, I then had to delete all the default controller key bindings just to register my steering wheel and its button mappings.

Then we have the gameplay, I have seen some strange things in my play through, for example it was night time and the game asked me to complete a mission where I drive a route with some advertising, I thought I will drive the bus to the depot (a bus not assigned to any route yet) and then skip time to the early hours of the morning, I saw on the mini-map another bus right where my bus was (but it wasn't showing in the game) I follow its blip on the map where it then randomly spawns and goes crazy (it was a bendy bus) this then hit me like a ball under the world where I then respawned in another random bus, that was ""returning to depot"" I got a bit confused what went wrong there.

Then we have the fact that when I started playing I played in the reccomended difficulty, I didn't like the way the controls were set out so I decided to modify them a bit, but this made it impossible for me to drive, my bus just wouldn't move at all. I ended up re-loading the game, it asked me to drive route 2, so I went to the bus, stopped at 1 stop and it completed that quest. Easiest quest ever... I have decided that maybe I should start a whole new save, and this second playthrough went without a hitch and where I put all the time.

Is it worth buying right now (near its original launch of September 7th 2021) Probably not unless you are a die hard fan, but give it a few months the devs will have hopefully polished the game up and it will be worth it.

Overall with the bugs and other problems aside, I think it is a fun and great game and I can see it has quite a bit of potential. But I still say that the devs might want to try issuing Early Access next time as a lot of these bugs can be found just by playing for the first few minutes. Sending out promo copies to YouTubers doesn't do anything to help fix the issues, they just want the views on exclusive content.

Most people playing Early Access titles expect there to be bugs and teething troubles, but when you release a game full price, with day 1 DLC with these sort of bugs, expect bad reviews."

First up, this game is fun! I've honestly enjoyed the hours played so far.

That out of the way, this very much feels like an Early Access title. Performance is poor on a 3060Ti at 1080p, which should be virtually impossible. Turning down shadow detail helps.
The English translation needs a lot of work; many words are mis-used, or sounds-close-but-not-actually-right. Plenty of misspellings too.
Bugs and glitches are rampant; from collisions with nothing at all, to AI pathing leading to pointless traffic jams and riders not being able to get on or off the bus, to the Route listing getting confused and doubling up stops or losing track of which stop the bus is on (displaying 4, while the active is 2, but updating to 5 when 3 is reached). Quests not giving progress correctly as requirements are met.
The tutorial alternates between pedantic follow-every-step-exactly-or-else-start-over, and being assigned a goal that has never been touched on, leaving you to fumble around until you figure out what it means and where/how to get it done. Then ends, apparently without touching on most of the more complex elements (or maybe I just haven't triggered the next step of the tutorial yet, I have no idea!).
My favorite is how you can't click on anything in the cockpit if you're using head tracking, without turning your head to point the reticle-dot exactly at the button or switch you want to activate. The mouse pointer is still there the whole time, but it's literally pointless.

This one definitely needs at least another month or two in the cooker with severe QA and bugfixing. Again, IT IS FUN AS-IS, but it'd be a lot more fun without the constant aggravation of the large and glaring rough edges."

Free weekend. Wheel controls were a nightmare to adjust and there is no gear stick support. Humans generated are neon haired disasters and cars give way when they have priority. That aside it’s a great novelty. Indicating, kneeling, opening doors and selling tickets with change. Then there are the small touches like honking at cars holding up a green light or telling passengers to keep it down. What put me off buying however was the managerial fluff setting up routes for peak-times, upgrading the necessary bus stop and district levelzzzzzz."

Incredibly buggy.

The AI vehicles are horribly ugly, and do NOT know how to drive. They move incredibly slowly, and will yield for any traffic, even when they don't have to. A lot of time will be spent/wasted waiting behind AI cars that won't friggin move.

The AI pedestriants are the same. They will sometimes run into the bus, causing a ""20.000€ insurance claim"", aswell as a warning. Other times they get stuck inside the bus, and will no-collide outside when you start driving.

Another thing that is really annoying is the ""Passenger forgot to get off the bus"" event, which you will always fail. I've had to completely disable this feature, because it will always fail, even though you let the passenger get off the bus immediatly."

I love this game. Just the fact it runs in Unreal Engine and gives a good vibe for driving a bus and expanding a network is amazing. Sound, graphics eveyrthing the noise, squeking plastic, roadbumps etc. from a bus is realistic. Played until my city was full with buses and performance degraded with like over 5million € and 100 buses.
however the only downside of this game is polish and performance and glitches like your bus is stuck and you cant drive away from a stop if there are more passengers than your bus can take, also getting stuck in a glass door of some busses and some stops. Weird glitches and things that you wouldn't think you would encounter. Although i have to say ive seldom had as much fun with a bus simulator this is the best such game ive ever played also with best graphics and simulation noise eveyrhting atmosphere is great. I kind of uninstalled it as weirdly as when i had played it so much my city was so full of buses and money just rolled in that performance was slowing down and there wasnt much more to do."

It's a good game with good graphics, however there are a huge amount of bugs and it doesn't seem to be tested very well. Some busses also aren't very accurate.
The game also uses most sounds from BS18 (engine sounds, buttons, indicators, and some doors) which is a bit disappointing and unrealistic.
The (all) busses also seem to not have suspension which is also unrealistic.

It's definitely better than BS18, but still has a lot of issues that need to be fixed."

Totally the worst bus simulator among all of the paid ones, even worse than some free one.
First, the online mode is always stuttering, we can't even drive fluently.
Second, some of the useful features in 18 have been removed, like custom license plate number.
Third, the AI is still awful.
Fourth, the controller system is also worse than 18. I can't shorten the fade time of my steering wheel, which makes me impossible to drive by a controller. It turns out that I have to use pedal to accelerate but have to use my mouse to steer, this makes my back sore.
Last, and make the game the worst. The service never respond, whether on in-game or Discord. So none of my problem can be solve.

It is because that I spend over 2 hours to find out so many problem, and 18 is good so I believe 21 would improve, so I didn't refund. But it's still AWFUL now. So I strongly recommend DO NOT BUY THIS. If you really want to play something new, go buy The bus. EVEN A HALF-FINISHED GAME IS MUCH BETTER THAN THIS."

The game was fun, but unfortunately they have an issue in multiplayer that makes it literally unplayable to drive together. Initially when i steer its not buttery-smooth like in singleplayer, but it lags when steering. Its like those old 90s car games.
I'll keep this game in my library and wait for a fix from the devs.

Other than that one issue the game is fun:
- Do missions to earn money for your company.
- Customize the controls for your liking.
- Open up to 5 doors on your bus or open all doors with the click of 1 button.

I would recommend this game for those thats in it for the singleplayer part, but if you wanna play with friends it is not worth it."

ORIGINAL REVIEW [negative]: First negative review I've left on Steam.

I'm not one to jump in when a game has bugs or missing features upon release. However, the game launched THREE MONTHS ago and I'm still not able to use my wheel. A wheel that the developer announced as having official support.

This has certainly put me off continuing with the franchise.

EDIT [positive]:

Well, I decided to give this another go and I've been playing this with a smile on my face. My wheel now works and after a few hours of gameplay, I picked up the season pass. Loving the addition of the school buses and related jobs.

Quite an amazing turnaround for me. I'm usually quite stubborn."

- Handling isn't all that bad
- Drivers don't flick you off if you pull out on them

Cons:
=Can't run people over and watch them suffer

After a bit over an hour of playing the game, I must say that it's not bad. But it doesn't mean it's perfect. I really liked Bus SIm 18 and was excited for this one, but skeptical after seeing the reviews.

The game kinda plays the same with a few changes and new features. The American-themed map is nice. It's good to have something different for once instead of always driving on an European-themed map. The selection of buses is very good.

Driving feels ok, FFB works acceptably well. Buses don't feel heavy, they feel a little bit too light in my opinion.
The AI traffic is not the best but it also ain't bad. There have been improvements over Bus Sim 18, like cars passing you when you're stopped at a bus stop. But they also tend to pass you when you're at an intersection with your blinker on, which isn't all that good. They also sometimes (not always) stop in the middle of the street for no reason on some streets.

Passenger AI works, but a few times I've noticed that when many passengers try to board at the same time, they get stuck at the door so you have to close the door, pull forward and open the door again to fix this.

I was unable to finish the tutorial at first, since nothing happened at the bus depot after doing everything. I was able to finish it the second time.

I haven't really encountered any game breaking bugs yet, a few quirks here and there. I guess the last few patches have fixed a lot of the problems many users have reported so it is nice to see the development team listen to players.

I may update this review if I find anything people should know before buying."

UPDATED:

SEE PAST THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS, THE HARD MAJORITY ARE OVER REACTIONS TO MINOR, NON-SERIOUS ISSUES THAT HAVE EITHER BEEN RESOLVED, OR ARE A WORK IN PROGRESS.

After now over a week of absolutely being hooked on this game, I would like to reaffirm my stance. I have coming up to 50 hours as of the time I am writing this, and I am absolutely in love with this new game. It is absolutely heart breaking to see how many people are having hissy fits over the littlest of issues they are having that aren't a big deal at all and do not take away from how good this game is.Yes, technical issues have happened with wheels that are being resolved, but what are we really expecting from a small scale development team trying to make such a good, feature rich game? Triple A titles with millions put into it have had worse results... and people are review bombing this game because of VISUAL glitches that are VERY minor. My only issues I have had with this game surround customising busses, and making it a little easier to duplicate designs onto other buses. The settings on this game are very customisable and there are many options as to how you can play the game. Once again, thank you for making such a good sequel to Bus Simulator 18, I adore this game <3



-Review posted on day one-
As someone who has played both Bus Simulator 16 and Bus Simulator 18, I can say with complete confidence that this new instalment is a major improvement from the last. The new USA map feels excellent to drive through, and is truly refreshing. A lot of previous features such as buying new buses and customisation now require you to be much more interactive by going to designated specialist buildings to do so. The driving feels new with how the wheel now operates to make driving more smooth on keyboard. The vehicle line up is outstanding and I cannot wait to try them all. If you are a Bus Simulator fan, this game is an amazing improvement from the last, and I am very excited to work my way through this game. Very happy to move from Bus Simulator 18 to this. Great job Stillalive and Astragon."

Game got way worse than during beta playtest. First of all, the steering is unacceptable. As you try to maintain control of the bus, the steering wheel randomly jerks to the left and right because the mouse input isn't detected. Secondly, the game is still very unstable despite it being more and more stable for me over the various patches that have been released to hotfix issues.

Despite the management features and having a lot of buses come together in the Extended Edition, this game is an utter disappointment. Can't believe I chose to gift my friends this BS."

Issues I've faced in the first hour of playing -
- You can't bind any buttons to your wheel (My wheel is a driving force GT), so don't remove any binds if you want to use the buttons
- Clipping clothes, clipping ground textures
- Unoptimized, automatically set me to the ""Very high"" settings and I was given a slideshow - Had to go to medium to get 30fps
- After setting my character, it reset it back to the default character
- Graphics are worse than BS18, almost cartoon like.

Refunding the game, may reconsider if all the issues are fixed, or when the game is discounted fairly."

Love this game already. Yes you've probably read the other reviews and have seen a lot of teething issues, but considering this is only day 1, I'm pretty sure this will all get fixed very soon. You don't tend to see these types of issues on games with a much larger development team, mainly because these last minute issues get fixed on a massive day 1 patch. And speaking of a day 1 patch, the team have already worked super hard in getting a hot fix out today for steering wheels, so I have high hopes for them.

A lot of people are saying they're experiencing really poor frame rates with game. I'm not sure about that. If you consider constantly hitting 100 FPS on an RTX 3060 Ti to be ""poor"" then sure, but I don't, so I can't say I've got that issue. Now, is it poorly optimised? Absolutely. My system runs hot, and I mean, really hot. I turn down the graphics settings to Low to see if it alleviates the high temps, but no, the GPU still runs at the same really high temperature. Definitely some optimisation issues there, and I'm sure they will get fixed over time.

Would I recommend the game? Absolutely. It is a super fun game. It is the perfect game to play if you just simply want to wind down for the night or just mindlessly relax to for a while. If you enjoyed Bus Sim 18, you're going to absolutely love this one. Some people say that the UI is a little ""too cramped"" compared to the previous game, I don't think that's the case at all. I think that just comes down to the fact that people don't like change.

In conclusion, it has a few issues which I'm sure will get ironed out in the coming weeks. But other than that, it seems like a fun game and I can see myself playing this game for a while. I will update this review once the issues outlined above have been fixed :)"

I like the game and time flies. If you like management style games mixed with jumps and getting your hands dirty you will love this game. Although there are some bugs and fun and annoying things. In general the game is very playable. The graphics are good, but there are also graphic glitches such as the dashboard on the buses sometimes not loading properly and being pixelated or the dials shaking.
The NPCs are terrible, they are one of the most annoying things in the game. Wheelchair NPCs don't always get in the first time, and that takes time when you have to wheel everything in and out multiple times. Some of the phrases NPCs say don't match the time of day or the weather, and they happily randomly run in front of the bus and get you a 20,000$ fine. Cars stop and stand at free intersections or speed out and cause traffic jams. Cars sometimes don't brake and collide with you, causing you to get a repair penalty. I hope the developers keep fixing bugs because in the end it means the game gets better.

As much as it sounds like I'm only going to rate this game negatively, I enjoy the game, despite the negative things I mentioned, it's a very good one. I wouldn't recommend it at full price with all these issues if it's been out for almost two years, but if it's on sale I'd definitely recommend it."

I am no bus driver. But I have played a lot of Bus Simulator 18, so that makes me more than qualified to write this review, right?

Graphics - improved over 18. The city is nice, but definitely not triple A game nice. Its a sim game, expect sim graphics. But its a vast improvement over the previous game, and the new map is fantastic.

Gameplay - most of the game is fixing little issues that were in the previous game. And it helps. Most of the time, you manage your bus routes, and then drive routes. Its fun to manage, and its great to get out and drive.

Some highlights:

Took man in wheelchair about 5 stops too many because I forgot put the ramp down at his selected spot.

NO ONE HAS TALKED TO ME ABOUT WINTER OF PASSION YET

The game isnt cheap. So unless you love buses, you could wait for a sale.

My bus is a giant pride flag wrap

I created a 2 stop route that goes around a single block. It doesnt make much money, but what a ride.

Conclusion - I like it. You might too. Or you might hate it. It really depends on your love of sim games and buses. If you dont like either of those, look elsewhere. If you like buses and sims, get it.

Enjoy!"

This game is not much of an improvement from Bus Simulator 18. There are not much new features in this version except for a new map and some changes in how certain things are done, like customizing a bus.
The voices of the npc's are exactly the same as the ones in bs18. I only heard one or two new ones. The AI is for me the most disappointing aspect in this game, same as in bs18. NPC cars are stuck on free crossings or just in the middle of the road. Traffic jams that don't resolve at all which makes your bus ""out of hours"" or at least late if you decide to take more minus points for driving over a sidewalk or on the other lane which is for oncoming traffic.
Sometimes I got an warning message for driving against a one way street on a regular two way street. That made me wonder how many more warnings I got that are not supposed to happen. Each warning means a deduction in points and money.

Missions get stuck, one in particular where the ""take over"" part of the game is explained. You can take over the bus from drivers and continue the route yourself. That particular mission got stuck. I did the steps several times before it got finished. It took 3 reloads of the game to finish that mission and continue.

So the game is not optimized and has a lot of the same issues that bs18 had. Hardly any new features but a high pricetag.
That is why I can not recommend this game."

I am glad that developer has put soo much effort updating this game!
They are amazing!


====

Since everyone is talking about bugs, I will skip that part and just focus on the map itself.

Big map, great detail in recreating US neighborhood, but the road itself, which developer should definitely focus on, is not as detail as the scenery.

These cons in US map are making it very unrealistic. After comparing to Europe map from BS 18(it is included)

I really hope they can improve the map, just like Truck Simulator from SCS Software:

1.
It turns out there are some stop sign, but way too little

2. Missing pillar under some ramp and bridge. e.g. Gold Island
3. Lane marking is very unrealistic, especially for:
- Highway Ramp, missing a lot of marking for merging and exit
- Intersections (TOO MANY MARKING! We know how to drive straight)
4. There is no Speed limit sign

Europe map is way better than US map, there are also some bugs:

1. Car parked on the street are facing wrong side

I am worried that developers might not improve the US map in Bus Simulator 21, there are lots of thing that needed to be fixed. At this moment I will stick to Europe map."

TL:DR:

lazy developers

bug simulator 21 is keeping the same bugs as the previous versions
everything is broken
developers do everything to make this game be as trash as possible while robbing you
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After playing the 2018 edition and recently the 2021 Next Stop edition, I have come to the conclusion that:

1. They don't test their own game.
2. They don't fix bugs.
3. They are not interested in improving their game.
4. Their sole intention is to create poor content implementations that they can easily sell to the community and make money from.

I will now list some bugs that I have found while playing this game. I will put an ** next to those that carry over from the previous Bug Simulator edition.

- Force Feedback keeps switching on and off randomly.**
- Some cars don't have their lights on during the night.
- You randomly hit pedestrians even when you don't hit them.**

This game company lied to us, saying, 2 years after launch, that they would have fixed the bugs. Instead, what they really wanted was to sell new expansions, DLCs, and implement poorly made content, full of bugs (trams), and make easy money. Just look at those ""rails"" they lazily covered all roads with.

They don't care about the quality of the game. They will say they do when they need to take your money. Complete lie.

Don't buy this game if you want quality."

It's absolutely not worth $52 CAD but I got it for around $27 and for that price it's a little more reasonable. The core loop is exactly what you want: it's driving a bus. You pick people up and drop them off. It controls well enough with a controller, feels a little unwieldy at first but once you get the rhythm it's very satisfying to make a turn perfectly. I couldn't be bothered to learn how to build new routes so I eventually dropped it, but until that point it's a nice chill out game."

Lots of the negative reviews released are a complete over reaction, yes the game has glitches & problems but the developers are working on them. This game for me is full of huge improvements and a few problems. The bus sounds are poor ie the Enviro sounds like the Mercedes but the designs are good. The timetable improvement is huge, being able to track the buses on the map is amazing. Also being able to finish a route and then just do it again seamlessly is very good. The map is good & the bus station is very good. For me the sounds are the only major let down"

As someone who loved Hardspace: Shipbreaker, I already know I'm going to love this game. Judge my words by how long I've continued to play after writing my review.

I immediately recognize there's a lot of quality of life features here to make the experience pleasant.

Chucking things into the truck has an extremely long range, have yet to find the limit. And you only need to be looking in the general direction.

There's no survival mechanics to worry about, so you're free to just endlessly deconstruct to your heart's content.

You can fully strip the ships down to absolutely nothing. Very satisfying.

You can upgrade your tools, making each teardown slightly faster and easier than the last.

You use a crane for removing very heavy parts, and have explosives to blast shortcuts through something, such as electrified doors/walls which may otherwise be difficult to get through.

There's quite a lot of ships to tear down! The first few aren't full ships, but by the end you have a gigantic tanker/cargo ship! Can't wait to get to that!

So yeah! If you liked Hardspace: Shipbreaker, you'll definitely like this game! In fact I'd already dare to say this is probably a better game. It runs better at least, and it isn't distracted with trying to have a story.

Please don't add a story, devs!

If it's even remotely possible, add mod support! Mods always take a game to the next level and greatly increase its value! Player made ships to tear down would be AMAZING!"

The thing you must keep in mind when evaluating this game is what you're looking for going in and how this game compares to other titles in publisher PlayWay's library and to the first game in this series.

Ship Graveyard Simulator 2 is a salvage game, where you are dropped into a shipyard, given a set of tools, and must scrap parts of or entire naval vessels however you please, be it systematically or chaotically. Compared to the first game, this title is vastly improved by allowing modular destruction of ships. For that alone it is praiseworthy, but it shares many of the similar qualities with regards to how the game plays and what some might criticize it for: repetition, tedium, lack of variety in environments.

Ships are assembled like legos instead of other destruction titles that tout voxels or other granular destruction elements. In fact this game shares a lot with the Gold Standard in this genre, Hardspace: Shipbreaker. Not a bad title to take inspiration from. The loop involves destroying parts of the ship, gathering up the pieces, and chucking them into your truck (with infinite capacity, thankfully), and eventually carting off to be sorted (in a very simple minigame) and either sold or used to upgrade your tools. This is peak Dad Game that may turn off players looking for a bit more stimulation in their gameplay.

Ships gradually increase in size and complexity but I noticed that there was a lot of repetition in design, particularly noticeable at the end of the first tier of ships, where large objects are placed in similar situations and use similar tactics to free up. A path for a crane must be cleared to haul these large objects out, which is a nice touch, but I wonder how necessary this is or whether levels would be more expediently completed with the strategy below.

After you've cleared a path and gotten everything of value out of the ships, a familiar pattern sets in where you try to use the game's logic to isolate the destructible walls & floors from the ship superstructure so that everything falls apart by itself. Several minutes spent gathering and chucking into your truck results, which can get tedious. It is still a nice feeling to not only slowly tear apart the ships and see your work in real time, but to be able to use the crane to haul off the ship superstructure, like cleaning your plate of food.

The tools themselves are improved. Upgrades change the game from taking some effort to peel off walls and slice through junctures into Rip n' Tear in terms of efficacy and speed. I was better able to get into the flow of it once I could one-shot studs with my hammer and use the saw with minimal cutting speed. Crucially, a grappling-hook style rope was added from the demo that aids in traversal. While it doesn't always work great, the fact that it's there was welcome.

All in all, for the price I paid for it and compared to its predecessor, this title is a huge step forward and is one of the better titles in PlayWay's catalog in terms of polish and stability. It does have bugs but mainly to do with the physics causing objects to float in the air or elements not destroying when they should. There was a temporary loss of using my tools that I was able to figure out how to fix on my own.

As long as you know what you are buying and don't mind these type of games, I definitely recommend it. It's no Hardspace: Shipbreaker, but even Hardspace, for all its polish, had significant issues and a controversial development cycle with similar constrained variety, and not many of these type of niche games are being made."

Wow, somehow they manage to make it actually worse than the first game. The first Ship Graveyard Simulator was not an ideal game, but it was fun to scrap stuff from ship carcasses. Here? Not so much. Sure, you can actually destroy hulls now, the graphics is a bit prettier and you get ability to jump around. That is all that good here. In the first game, when you hit things you supposed to hit - they were deforming, when you cut things you were allowed to cut - you see animation of cutting and then the cut itself. And if you cut it in a wrong place you will get leftovers you will have to cut again if you want more materials. In this game? You hit point and it simply change color to black. You cut something - you see animation of tool working and then, guess what, part lose color. Not cuts, no deformation, just change of color. And there is literally no connection between the tool and the materials. You see animation of tool in the air and the part you were destroying lose color. Then, when you decolor all the connection you ""bonk"" the part with your hammer (actual in-game name of the action) and it becomes disconnected. You are free to press the button and pack whatever that was into small box in your hands and to throw it to your track. And as long as you point in the right direction - it does not matter how far away your truck is. It does make cleaning the place much faster, but with how small immersion is there already it just make the feeling of the game even worse.
But while immersion is the main thing in the simulators, there are more downgrades from the first game. Another big thing that was watered down is progression. Previously there were experience you get from using tools, fulfilling contracts and making money. When you leveled up you get skill points you were able to use in simple and straightforward skill tree, separate for each tool. And available ships were unlocked based on your level - there was a goal to work towards. Now? No experience, no unlocks. As long as you have enough money you can order any ship. But there are even more. In the first game there was a progression for facilities. And when you get a new level you unlock more options and the facility get a visual upgrade. Not anymore, everything is at the max level already as far as I can tell. You can still upgrade tools and now there are one or two more levels of them, though. Oh, and in the first game there were a progress bar for ship demolition. It was satisfying to hit 100% knowing that you actually did everything. And you get a nice change of background color from red to green in the ship booking system when you get at least 90% of the ship disassembled. Not anymore. And, unless it will unlock at some arbitrary point in the future, the hiring workers system is gone too. As well as making advanced materials on your own. Now all you need to upgrade your tools you can only get from the ship. Only tools upgrades can be crafted. And it looks like you don't even need to upgrade tools to destroy advanced points, you can do it with anything. meaning that another progression system was scrapped.
And on top of that I get 2 crushes to desktop in less than one hour here. In the first game I did not get a single one in several hours.
Someone in upvoted revies for this game compared it to Hardspace: shipbreaker. The only similarity is that you can completely disassemble something called ""ship"". Every other part of this game is objectively less developed. There is no story, no characters, no material deformation, no goal, no challenge. The only thing in the SGS2 that required at least some thinking is how to get ""heavy equipement"" out before you can destroy its supports.
I would advice to stay away from this title unless some significant game mechanics will be added."

The game has good concepts. The reason for my review is the overall lack of progress. I have moved up now to the difficult ships and what I have noticed is
1- There is no real new concepts of challenges (the winch is nothing really). Ships are simply previous elements put together in different arrangements.
2 - The use of each tool becomes harder (more effort, hits, time). The issue is you end up with the same resource and same cost while the ships are bigger. Hence you have to upgrade your tools to work on larger ships but there is no benefit (financially or timing) in doing this. The previous game at least the materials value was proportional to the effort involved
3- Outside the ship, there is noting to do except upgrade and the recycling and the way it is done does not add to the game.
The movement around and use of tools is good and as a time killer game I works well, but as the ships get larger and harder, it just become monotonous and frustrating as the benefit is not there."

The developers have been begged, pleaded with, bribed to put a functional auto-save into this game. It crashes a lot (A LOT... did i mention A LOT). But, they would rather you pay for their inadequacies.. neh... their incompetence. This is not a new concept. Not only not new. It's almost just a default at this point. It boggles the mind actually, because you almost have to be purposefully piss off your customers to not do one. They will reply to this saying there is one. But, it only auto-saves when you do things that you won't be at for hours while working in a ship. Then the horrible programming kicks in and crashes your game. Losing your hours of work. To quote coach from LetterKenny... It's #$%*ing embarrassing. I would refund the game if i could. Let me be your cautionary tale. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME unless you are a masochist. It is not and was not ready to be released. The bugs are astounding (Things mentioned in prologue). I'm not talking about finding a weird bug you would only run into cause your trying to get to hidden places or such.. i'm talking about things you would discover in 5-10 minutes of QA'ing this game."

Review written October 2023, with version 1.0.5 of the game. I would have reviewed it earlier but the game went through some bad stages when it had such annoying bugs it wasn't worth playing. As far as I can tell right now, any remaining bugs are minor.

Enjoyable game for people who like making sense of things, clearing up messes, or compulsively tidying things away. I'm not qualified to talk about OCD, but an obsessively neat person might enjoy it.

A training stage plus 12 ships, or portions of ships, to clear out, disassemble, collect the pieces and take them for recycling. With the profits from whatever you've just done you can buy upgrades on six different tools which help you work faster or better. You can stop working on any ship at any time, take whatever money you've made so far, and move on to the next. Or you can clear up every part of the ship leaving just an empty muddy space ready for the next one. Completely clearing a ship is very satisfying, but you get no bonus for it.

The free 'Prologue' version is the full game with all facilities, but features just the training stage and one large ship.

Pros: Good graphics, very rarely crashes or hangs, features autosave. Rope feature is fun.

Cons: Apparently, with 50 thousand in the bank and nothing to spend it on, I'm still working out of a draughty one-room shack with no toilet. I like a game which rewards me for doing well."

There is something satisfying about seeing a massive thing in front of you, and slowly-but-surely breaking it down until there's nothing left.
You start out with small ships, and work your way up to larger and larger ones. And each ship has ""contracts"" to finish, which helps you get some extra money, to afford the next ship. And being able to upgrade your tools to be stronger and faster, keeps everything feeling like a solid progression system.
And seeing how the developers have been paying close attention and fixing bugs, it makes me feel very good about recommending this game!"

A couple hot fixes have been done to try and fix picking up materials. Its still really wonky. Materials will fall and you won't be able to pick them up.

Graphic looking great but still there are small glitches but in 4h playing I ran only one... Also some might not like this (I personally like) there is no damage from falling parts... but it would be good that you could turn it on / off in options

One thing that I think it would be good that you can upgrade house and truck.

Fun game, but wow it crashes more times than I care to count. Anytime I try to use the in game wiki it crashes, switch tools to quick it crashes, or my favorite, just standing. Tools will glitch into hands and stay there making the game look terrible. I have only been able to complete 2 ships as my game keeps crashing on he third. Give it a couple of months.
Edit : As I have put 7 more hours into the game, I have learned the tricks to keep the game from crashing. It still crashes, but I know how to avoid. After the most recent update, the grab mechanic likes to never work sometimes. I spend most of the time spamming either E or left mouse to try and pick up an object or material and the game just doesn't let you. Kinda hard to play the game when the most important aspect to move forward doesn't work. Onto complaints that have nothing to do with bugs, the game lets you ""upgrade"" your tools, but you never really upgrade your tools. Upgrade your hammer to do more damage so you can break the connectors quicker and 2 ships later those upgrades don't matter and you're back to hitting the connectors 4 times on the massive ships making a long project take even longer. This is a crappy pay to play mechanic that is in mobile games. Why is it in a full price PC game? Play for so long, upgrade to get better at the game, then introduce new, ""harder"" level that really just puts the grind back to 0. Frustrating to say the least. Without all of the bugs, the game isn't worth full price. It's a hard pass from me."

Let's jump right into the main question here - would I recommend this game to you? That depends on two factors - how much do you enjoy simple repetitive tasks, and how much jank are you willing to accept?

If you want complexity, this is absolutely not the game for you. This is a game for people that want to shut off their brain and hold down a mouse button until their hand cramps. This is a game for people that like to watch objects fall through space. This is a game for people that want to think exactly one time in any given hour. If your tools are underlevelled for a ship - hint, if you were enjoying yourself smacking things just once on a level, next level you will no longer be enjoying yourself that way - you will be sitting there holding down your mouse button for quite a while. Your saw will go from having a blade installed to apparently having butter installed as you grind slowly through metal. Your hammer, which could easily pop a rivet out with a single hit, will suddenly take four.

(Just do a lower level ship a few times, you say? Look, friend, the ships are already so similar to one another that you begin to wonder if this is a shipping industry standard or developer laziness. If I start repeating ships my brain might actually wander off and leave my shambling husk to hold down mouse buttons without it.)

Please don't take this as a ""you should not play this game""! Look, I played the demo a lot, and I played the full game for 50+ hours at the time of this review - I am obviously a fan of mindless deconstruction. If you want that, this is a great source of it. When I'm stressed it's undeniably nice to have something really simple to unwind with, and this is certainly that.

Now, as for the jankiness of the thing... well. You're going to have to be cool with things being ""close enough"". The text is close enough to English. The hit boxes are close enough to accurate. The voices are close enough to understandable. If you don't mind constantly being a little tweaked by things, it's fine. If that sort of thing drives you crazy, maybe avoid.

Little things : There are only maybe six people in the world that purchase your items. Oh, sure, they give you different names and stories, but they have the same faces, they're not sneaky. The dirt you have on your arms makes it look like you have some kind of plague. No matter how prosperous you get, your shipyard will always look like it came from a Soviet post-apocalypse. You will sleep in a tumbledown shack forever and like it.

Big Things : . In a game that prides itself on tedium, this is easily the most tedious thing they have on offer. You have to sort colored items into boxes of the same color. The items roll down a ceaseless conveyor belt. There is no way to stop once you start. And if you wait until the end of a ship to sort the items, you will be there for approximately the entire childhood of your average human child. It's the only way to get materials (and thus money) out of the ships, so it's not optional. You will, in fact, be tempted to put a brick on the space bar and walk away to live a new life in another country. It sucks, guys. It's negative amounts of fun. Whoever decided this should be part of the game needs to be sent to their room without supper for no less than fourteen years.

So do the math in your head. How much do you like repeating tasks while your brain takes a nap +/- how much you love/hate janky games = whether or not you're going to like this game. Godspeed."

Firstly, the inventory system is horrible. While working on a ""ship"" every 10-15 seconds you'll get a popup saying you can't carry anymore and have to launch what you're holding into the truck. Even on the 3rd ship expect to have to make at least 100 shuttle runs to the truck to drop off resources. Utter madness.

I say ""ship"" because they aren't ships, they're small parts of ships that just magically appear on the beach. In the first game you watched the actual ships you'd be working on come in to shore for dismantling, rather than a chunk of a ship just appearing.

I feel like I've bought a demo. Where's the rest of the game?

Ship Graveyard Simulator 1 had loads more features: you could smelt resources into other resources, you got experience points you could use to improve your character and business, you could upgrade your buildings, you could hire staff. There were dozens of people about, some of whom offered quests. Where's all that? This game has none of those things.

The normal process for a sequel is to build on the success of the previous title. I've no idea what the plan was here. Whatever it was it's a bold strategy Cotton, let's see if it pays off for them.

TLDR - Just buy the first game when it's on sale. It's got way more to do than this has."

Views: 73


Ship Graveyard Sim 2 is basically a total upgrade. A removal of the fiddly metal fusion systems, the cumbersome and broken inventory system and the useless refueling systems basically mean that the game's much more streamlined in a very positive way.

It also helps that now you actually demolish and salvage the ship instead of salvaging the occasional fire extinguisher and chair while leaving the actual ship untouched.

There's some people who find the game... too game-like compared to the first game by having damage bars, but they also ignore somehow that a level 3 hammer breaks something perfectly while a level 2 hammer means that the fire extinguisher you're bashing is basically made out of some sci-fi unbreakable alloy.

This is nothing but a step forward in my eyes."

I do really enjoy this game and have put a fair few hours into it but there are a couple of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ which I find annoying and distract from my enjoyment of the game.
I have upgraded the majority of my tools to level 10 which are great for the first and second difficulty ships, however they are ridiculously slow on the third difficulty, speed of tools should not be part of what makes the shop more difficult!
Also, the sorting mini game after you’ve deconstructed a ship is tedious and I wish there was a way to skip it without losing all the scrap in the truck."

Initial Review: Game crashes too much.

Subsequent Review:

Autosave helps with crashes but does not solve the root problem.

Game is also very buggy, physics are broken, many things ""float"" even though there is nothing supporting them. Some rivets and torch points are embedded in other things making them very hard to deconstruct or in some cases impossible.

The bugs get worse as you get to bigger ships, so initially they might not be noticeable, but they become very aggravating as you play longer.

Game needs a lot of QA.

I stick by my initial recommendation, this game is a buggy mess."

The graphics are nice and the game-play loop is fine (breaking down ships hulks). But the mechanics are too simplistic and there are some crucial missing elements for a proper simulator.
Tool use is simply point and click, for a game that revolves around using these tools it feels lacking in depth.
There is no player injury, so you can literally destroy the whole bottom deck of a hulk and thousands of tons of steel can collapse on top of you and nothing happens, no consequences for stupid actions.
There are other game-play mechanics that are totally immersion breaking but i can understand why they did them even though i don't agree with them.
Overall the game is too fast paced and too simplistic for a proper simulator. Its good if you want to play for ten minutes at a time but not if you want to play long term. Its a phone app game masquerading as a PC simulator game, seems like there are a lot of these around nowadays. Quick fix games that have no longevity because there is no skill required to learn how to play and therefore no challenge to keep you coming back in the future.
Sad."

60 hours in, I think I can review the game now. First, this is a huge improvement over the original. I do like the way the changes are done. I have completed the final ship, now just to finish upgrading tools, and earning the $$$ achievements.

Overall, pretty bug free, but I did find some pesky ones. The final ship, I found the most difficult to remove large objects. The end of the ship had some floor pieces glitched into the actual pieces that were permanent, so I could not remove them, and those stopped me from removing the entire end piece.

The generators, engines, or whatever they are at the back of the ship, when I tried to remove them, the UI showed me that the crane could not access the objects because of the floor under the engines. I ended up using an explosive to remove the floor, which destroyed the engines.

When I opened up the cargo bay doors, at first I was like, yes, just drop in there and remove the floor anchors, and I will be good to pull them out. Nope. The walls next to them were keeping them in place, so I could not get to this until I fully disassembled that entire part of the ship. Which is very difficult to do if you don't realize you need to remove those tall walls before removing those giant divider things.

I did complete the contracts on the final ship, so it did not stop me from completing the game, it just stopped me from making a little extra profit.

Overall, I do recommend you buy this game, especially if you enjoyed the first one."

Very much enjoying this relaxing game, plenty of variety of ships a bit grindey but still a great little sim. My only bugbear at the moment is the optimization. Although my pc is quite powerful {Ryzen7}, it does tend to crash on high graphics, so I play on lowest with vsync off and 70 percent definition. I must point out the updates come thick and fast and the devs are very supportive of this title."
ship+graveyard+simulator+2,Not Recommended,15.4,"Posted: August 29
Game is not in a ready state to play, the core physics of how objects are supported makes you question what part of the structure is holding the rest up. On the larger ships, if you remove the hull sides, the structure still registers it as there. Meaning that there is a mess of floating structures that can often be hard to reach and require tedious dismantling as it's difficult to tell which part of the structure is holding it together. Even resorting to explosives doesn't work as it only blasts walls not beams.

Beyond which, the game turns into 'Pickup the trash' simulator. You are rate limited to how many items you can pick up at a time and how much weight until you have to throw the volume into your truck or away. You end up spending more time picking up junk than actually dismantling the ships. And even after upgrading the ability to pick up more weight and items at a time, it is still a taxing/unfun part of the game that takes up at least 30% of the time if not more."

SOLID GAME! VAST IMPROVEMENTS FROM THE FIRST!

I love Ship Graveyard Sim, and this one just went above and beyond from the 1st game!

I literally have no complaints after playing this 2nd installment.

I didn't like running back and forth from my truck to deposit my inventory and was bummed when I had to stop a ship because I didn't have the tools for it. And stopping mid-ship because your inventory on the truck and yourself were full, just UGH!

This 2nd version just addresses all the old issues the 1st game had and completely wiped them out!

I can TOSS things to my truck! XD
It's a satisfying motion to YEET your inventory onto your truck!

And let's not forget that you get to upgrade the crates you use to carry, so you can carry more and more

And the TOOLS!!!! OMG THE TOOLS!!! You start with EVERY TOOL!
All you're responsible for is improving them! And the improvements are very much worth it!
I'm only at lvl 4 for most of them and dismantling the ships goes much faster.

Well done!! Love the game!!"

About 5 hours in and liking the game so far tho there are an few things that I would like to see changed and that is the option for ratio support for screens to be able to change between 16:9 and 21:9 its fun playing in ultrawide but gets annoying having to look from one end of the screen to the other, something else I would like to see is when you go to scrap a ship it marks it so you remember it is one that you have done the way around this ive found is to not scrap it and leave it sitting there so it shows you it can be scrapped something else i would like to see is an way to toggle rivits so you can chose if you deleting an whole zone of rivvits or just part of a wall other than this i am enjoying the game so far"

I played this for about 7 hours straight and it is now early morning as I write this.
Game is good just like the first game except it has more things to upgrade and you can actually salvage the whole ship! That is awesome!
Fun fact you barely need the saw as the game stands now since you can just hammer floors beneath walls and stuff so you do not have to saw most of the reinforcements in the wall at all if you don't want to.

Graphics are good,
I did not see more than one bug where door refused to be picked up other than that I did not see bugs.
Game has more things to break apart than the first game, good.

I rate this game 5/5 if you liked the first game you will like this as well.

Ship Graveyard Simulator 2 is a solid and polished, but not groundbreaking, entry to the genre. I can easily recommend this game to fans of Simulators that think they’ll like the ship aesthetic. People new to the genre will find it very approachable and reasonably priced so it would also be a good introduction to the genre, especially if you’re nautically inclined. If you’re more likely to see this as a tedium simulator, then I doubt this is the genre for you.

The game performs well on my system thanks to heavy use of dynamic scaling. The graphics are more than good enough for the genre, the sounds are adequate although the sound of depositing resources on your truck gets annoying fast. My primary technical problem with the game was a crash every couple of hours of play. Not the biggest problem since you can quick-save but it’s never pleasant having your “work” lost. The only other problem is the lack of the standard borderless fullscreen mode which should be in every game at this point,

Fun if you enjoy cathartic repetition and are a completer/finisher type but too many bugs breaks the rhythm and your investment when it's already quite a grind.

I have been enjoying the game to a degree, but the quality of things leaves a LOT to be desired.
The music and sounds for the most part are really... strange? They don't sound like they fit the game at all.
The NPC voices sound like they're a text-to-speech engine.
I've experienced pretty regular crashes which in some cases can make me lose a lot of progress.
The gameplay doesn't really change much at all after the 2nd or 3rd ship.
The sorting facility is just annoying and makes irritating sounds.
I really wish that the glove upgrades increased your throw speed.
Most of the game is you just picking up items and throwing them in your truck, which would be fine if the time it takes to throw the box didn't always remain the same and be needlessly long.
I also really wish that the game had a way of showing you all the 'heavy' elements, because on the larger ships I scour them from top to bottom and still feel like I have missed one and that causing a collapse is going to make me lose one of them.
The prices for things seem really out of balance. Some ships you only get a tiny bit more back in resources compared to what the ship cost. Yeah there is also the contracts, but they're problematic in their own way in that they give you such a large percentage of the money you acquire, that it discourages you from actually fully stripping a ship and instead just completing the contracts and ignoring the rest.

There's a potentially very satisfying gameplay loop buried in this game, but I can't really recommend it at it's current quality, at this price. In Australia this game is selling for $29.50, which is about $20 USD. I'd be a lot happier with my purchase if it had only cost me half that."

ship+graveyard+simulator+2,Not Recommended,169.7,"Posted: August 22
update: still can't recommend. the whole premise of the game is: break stuff apart, pick it up, throw it in the truck. well, you can't pick up a lot of stuff, you can't hit a lot of the connectors to break things apart, and stuff bounces out of the truck and grenades on the ground or just bounces away.

and don't bother with the busted gravity. crap floating all over the place after walls are knocked down.

These are basic game play issues that should have been resolved prior to launch. I'd say I'm surprised but the first installment was a mess, too. why'd I buy the second installment? I hoped the obvious bugs would have been worked out, like getting stuck all over the place.

original post:
Bugs. Bugs. And more bugs. This game needs an exterminator there are so many bugs.
- vehicle rolls over if you turn too fast, no way to reset
- vehicle 'high centers' and gets stuck
- tool selection freezes, can't change tools
- tool glitches: for example, swing the hammer, and it bugs and never stops swinging
- section of ship can be completely disconnected but can't be removed, probably related to parts glitching into other parts and not being removable."

First and foremost, this is not a bad game and a lot of fun like the first one.
At the moment though, i cannot recommend this game.

There are a lot of bugs and some of them are truly gamebreaking. During the gameplay happened several times that the tools became stuck / blocked. After reloading a save this was fixed (most of the times). There comes the next big problem, the savegames.
There is at the moment not a true autosave system, the game gets saved after talking to a npc or when you access the menu. Not too bad, but when you are busy tearing down a ship and sometimes this takes more than 1 hour, the game crashes to desktop and nothing gets saves. Progress lost.

This happened 3 times to me now, so i uninstalled the game for now until this get fixed.
There came out a patch today, but the most important bugs didn't get fixed unfortunately.

Until these big gamebreaking bugs are not fixed, i am not going to play and i cannot recommend the game for now.
I hope there will be a fix soon, because as i said it is not a bad game at all and i was enjoying it a lot.

Please devs, fix the game asap so we can play it normally."

SGS2 is very grindy, but yet addictive to say the least. The price point is a bit high but you will certainly get you moneys worth out of it. However, you will need to get past the fatal errors which occur, and don't mind brain numbing gameplay. While the game has it issues it is still addictive to no end. I would say it is worth checking out or buying during a sale. Enjoy

Grade: 3/5

7 hours of gameplay for $18. I generally look for 1:1 hours played for $ spent. I could easily spend more hours in the game, but ive experienced all of the gameplay loops and now its just tedious for me.

Graphics suck. They just do. Textures are low-res in areas, and youll really notice it on your tools. Speaking of tools, the progression of tools will reward you with a different model which is nice.

I actually would still be playing except the game had a fatal crash.

Outside of the single crash I had, I only experienced one bug which happened twice. When I go to the recycling center, it loads the zoom animation twice and it gets stuck at the start of the zoom animation so I can barely see what I am sorting, making it really hard to sort properly.

From my point of view the game was very intuitive. Generally the physics works, though I did take some screenshots of floating walls (shared). The puzzle gameplay loop was satisfying. When you are taking an engine out from a bottom of a ship through 6 floors, with rooms that are electrified, etc... its a nice experience.

I can see where the game will get tedious very fast for some players. Repeating the same thing over and over can really grind you down. So here are some tips for those that will buy the game after reading this review. This is based on my experience of tearing down a $10, $20 and $400 ship.

1. Your tool rank scales backward with as ships get more difficult. On a $20 ship my 3 rank hammer could remove a bolt in 2 swings. On a $400 ship it took 4 swings and still took 4 swings after i upgraded to rank 4. Everything takes longer... welding, cutting... all of it. so if you rush to the expensive ships like I did youll feel the pain.

2. The trick to making the experience more efficient is figuring out what takes you the most time. I found that I spent most of the time using the hammer so I ranked that up first... but I think i should have ranked up my carry capacity and pick up speed too. On the $20 ship, which I tore down to the last piece, so.... much... picking up stuff time. The $400 ship had stuff that took up 40 wt and you start with 60. I actually leveled my capacity up to 100 which helped a bunch.

3. I think there is value on not tearing down a ship 100%. The 3 contracts you get is really where the money is at because you need the materials to upgrade your tools. ... so it depends on what your after, $ or materials for tools.

4. There are hidden rooms.. rooms with no doors or windows. Sometimes the thing your looking for to complete a contract is in a hidden room.

5. You can nearly dismantle a ship without actually sawing apart the beams. Just knock down all the walls, floors and ceilings and the beams fall apart automatically. Thats how I did the $20 ship... ceiling, walls, floor.. then everything falls down to the next level.

Anyway... to sum up. for $18 its nearly $2 per hour I got out of the game... which... even $60 games have a hard time matching now days.... so basically... its average. Graphics suck... omfg they suck, but the gameplay is decent enoug."

If you enjoyed the first game, You're gonna love this one. More of the same stuff, but better, instead of having something that you cant break with a level 1 hammer, you can now break everything, but if its higher level it will be a little bit slower, heaps of variety in the ships available and heaps of new tools and systems to take on.

There is a decent game, if the developer manages to fix it. This should have been tagged as early access. Right now rushed patches seem to introduce more and worse bugs than the ones that are fixed.

At the moment the game is only technically playable. The bugs are simply too glaring for this game to be considered viable entertainment.

Edit: The game is back to a playable state (at least for me), but between crashes and glitchy hit detection I still can't recommend it."

You should be aware if you played the demo that the actual game is incredibly buggy. I had no problems at all with the demo, but in the full game, I had problems using the cutter, having to stand in exactly the right spot to get it to work. I would have to circle around the item, moving closer and farther away, trying to find the right spot to stand where the game would actually perform the cut. Additionally, I had problems both knocking down items with the hammer (right click) and even picking things up off the ground, neither of which was a problem in the demo. I don't know what's wrong with the main game, but I thought it was odd that it asked me during installation to install a 2005 version of Microsoft C++.

Anyway, I have no choice but to refund it while I can. I'm at my two hour limit, and there's no indication that the game will get more functional. It's a shame because I really enjoy the game. I played through the demo twice."

game becomes inredably boring fast once u unlock all tools or hell get 3 hours into the game it just falls into the same gameplay loop that will be there the whole game just that some ships will take longer than others and others will take even longer if u want to progress then u better scrap the whole ship so it ends up being the first 30 mins ur removing ♥♥♥♥ by hand and exploring the next hour or 2 is removing the big items with a crane and the last hour to 6 is braking the walles which causes an exploit to destroy the whole ship as it all collapses iteself as the floor is not actually connected to anything and even if it was or the exploit doesnt work u just destroy the floor and the base floor lvls and the whole ship collapses then u spend another hour or 2 getting rid of all the scrap that fell or the whole truck and then u make like 3k after selling whole ships worth of scrap about 40k kg and then u get to buy like one or 2 upgrades that are horibally overpriced later in the game with this method all ships end up taking about the same time small and medium wise i quit right before i got to large as its not even like explosive do anything ♥♥♥♥ just is a massive time waste that takes ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ forever to progress and if u play just for contracts or something else ull eventrually just run out of money to buy new ships"

its a shell of the last game. at least you can break apart the whole ship, but it almost always leaves floating beams behind. there is no material smelting, no unique situations, no lockpicking, basic tool upgrades, oversimplified progression (a 2 star ship just takes more swings. it could be the same items, just suddenly tougher), no manager system, hell no explorable town. its just ships and tools and repetition. its honestly okay, but such a letdown compared to the last one. its just so unpolished and empty. 3/10"

As a reviewer, this was so damn tricky to decide if I liked it or not. It's actually not great, i'll be honest with that, but it's not awful, or even bad. There are some seriously addictive and relaxing elements to this (oddly enough on the relaxing part), which makes it worth some of your time to play it. See full review below.

Check to see if you can playtest first.....

I am a huge simulator game lover and because of this fact i tend to have to overlook bugs...and annoyances often!!!! However, this game (while I could have really enjoy) bring about unforgivable annoyances. The physics in this game are broke and almost without rhyme or reason. To put it simple if the only task in the game is to break down a ship to it's bear bones....and a player is unable to complete that task why would you ever bring the game to market? I The coding does not feel optimized and is clunky. While beautiful graphics on epic...and I mean BEAUTIFUL graphics for a simulation game....it comes at a price of cooking a computer running a 3060Ti pushing the temp to almost to 89C.

I want to see the DEVs fix there bugs as i want to enjoy this game and recommend it to others. But as it sits, if i could refund i absolutely would. In its currenly state I cant not recommend for as one who is not a serious sim fan. At the point the game is updated and the game is fixed of the physics bugs I will b happy to to recommend.

The last complaint i have....why on earth can you not have more than one ship at a time...its a shipYARD....a player being able to only have one ship at a time cuts into the immersivness and causes me to focus on the limits within the game V.S. giving me the feeling of vastness that one wants with sims. We know we cant have everything and go everywhere...but we want to FEEL like we can."

I am both very happy and very frustrated to write this review.

I didn't recommend the first game because of how removed the game felt from what was advertised. It felt like the ""deconstruction game we have at home."" I felt a great deal of frustration for how the game came out because there was so much potential and even other games in the same genera that could have been drawn from. In all, I wasn't angry. Just disappointed.

This game feels like what should have been released in the first place. It's not perfect and there's certainly other games that do it better, but for what it is? It's honestly very enjoyable to play. Tearing the ship apart is very satisfying and setting up and executing a massive domino effect as level upon level of ship collapses is a real treat. Everything works the way you would expect it to and they managed to keep the tool system simple without making every task simply point and click. They even added hazards that could hamper your salvaging mission. It really does feel like they saw the largest criticisms of their previous attempt and took them to heart. I give them major kudos for that.

It's definitely not perfect. The largest issue that carried over from the last game is the game's progression. The larger more difficult ships are only more difficult because the cut/impact points you need to hit to pull things apart have more health which require better tools which really just ends up feeling like a cheap way of introducing ""difficulty"". The introduction of hazards, while appreciated, is a little hollow as they are very easy to overcome and aren't actually dangerous. As far as I've seen, you have no health and no amount of excess kilos slamming down on your head from above will stand to challenge you. The only thing slowing your progress are the health bars throughout the ship and the number of things you have to deconstruct.

Unlike the previous game, however, I don't think the game's largest issues are beyond the scope of the engine. Future updates could add new ships, more things to do with your money, more reasons to look for hazards, and a greater concern for what's coming down on your head. If nothing else, a future installment could iterate further.

Final review score of a 6/10 (which could easily improve with later updates)

tl;dr: This is the game I wish they released to start with and it really does feel like there are serious incremental improvements being made. I hope they look to their peers to see what they could be doing better and find ways of putting a unique spin on it."

If you enjoyed Hardspace Shipbreaker, then this is for you.
It is very similar, only on a beach, and less suffocation because you neglected to go and buy more O2.

Only issue is: because you are on a beach, there is sand. Lots of sand, it's coarse, and rough, and irritating, and it gets everywhere..."

Product received for free

I received a review copy of this game to show on stream. My problem with it, was that the time just vanished. Before I knew it, 5 hours had passed, and then I was doing another ship after the stream finished.

It is a very relaxing game, and you can get lost for hours taking ships apart and upgrading your gear. I do like the fact that (at the moment of writing this) I can through a 120kg box about 100 metres and stack it perfectly in the back of the truck. Makes life s much easier.

I would definitely recommend this game, especially if you like House Flipper, Powerwash Simulator and other games like that.

I do not normally post reviews of games to often. However i feel the need to for this one, so nobody wastes their money on this game. I got it on sale cause i had played the first one, which mind you WAY BETTER. This game literally is a clicker and upgrade. Click 1 million times more doing the same thing. Then upgrade, so you dont have to click as much! Its not anything like the first one, the idea was there. However they destroyed the things that made the first one enjoyable. Like resource crafting, more of a world. Different variety of ships. This game just does pieces of the same ship different layout, over and over and over again. You get the same parts the same stuff everytime then you take it to a recycle plant where all you do is turn a dumpster and hold space to speed it up. All missions are on the PC in game now only. There is no world, you are stuck in this little hut with just a laptop and bed. All the stores are exactly next to each other, the speed at which the character runs. makes it feel even smaller. Your person has a weight limit on carrying stuff. Your truck on the other hand. Nope through an entire broken down boat with thousands of pieces all in to your truck without emptying it unless you are done or need money. ITS just super repetitive, with no real enjoyable aspect to it. DO NOT PURCHASE! YOU WILL PLAY FOR A FEW DAYS OR WEEK MAX. THEN GET ABSOLUTELY BORED!"

na tento simulátor jsem se hodně těšil ale opět jsem se těžce zklamal... hra mi za dobu hraní několikrát spadla tak že se nedalo dělat nic než ji natvrdo vypnout. A pokud už jakože fungovala a nepadala tak se zaseklo veškeré ovládání a opět nešlo dělat nic než hru opětovně načíst. Hra samotná není v podstatě špatná dokonce jsem si ji mezi dvěma pády i užíval v rámci možností...Možná ještě jedna výtka terén je neustále mokrý i když svítí slunko a vypadá to jako by auto jezdilo bažinou hru z vyše popsanývh problémů zatím nedoporučuji. Pokud dojde k nápravě není problém změnit hodnocení....Za jeden den tato hrůza dokázala spadnout asi jen 6x hnus toto je odporny padající hnus a vývojář by měl jít dělat něco užitečného pokud nechce dělat dobré a fungující hry...lituji peněz co jsem za hru dal...
Od vydání hry uplynuly už čtyři záplaty které nevyřešily vůbec nic a mizerné hratelnosti udělaly kompletní nehratelnost...

I was really looking forward to this simulator but again I was severely disappointed... the game crashed several times during the gameplay so that I couldn't do anything but turn it off. And if it was already working and not crashing, all the controls were stuck and again I couldn't do anything but reload the game. The game itself is not bad in principle even I enjoyed it between two crashes even within the limits...Maybe one more complaint terrain is constantly wet even when the sun is shining and it looks like the car was driving through a swamp game from the above described problems so far I do not recommend. If there is a remedy there is no problem to change the one day, this horror only managed to crash about 6 times.this is disgusting falling HNUS and the developer should go do something useful if he doesn't want to make good and working games...I regret the money I spent on this game...
Since the game's release, it's been four patches that haven't solved anything at all and made the crappy gameplay completely unplayable..."

90's video gamer dad here.... and this is a throwback to TMNT Arcade, Hyperstone Heist and Turtles in Time all at once! Mix in a bit of Streets of Rage elements in here, and you got a great beat em up! While multiplayer and cross play is still buggy/laggy/limited, I imagine this will only get better in time. Oh, and there is a bit of replay value as well, since the characters gain more abilities with increased usage.

My kids will learn the meaning of.... Cowabunga."
teenage+mutant+ninja+turtles+shredders+revenge,Recommended,4.4,"Posted: June 16, 2022
If you're a fan of Hyperstone Heist or Turtles in Time, scroll back up and buy Shredder's Revenge. Don't mull over it, don't read a cross section a reviews and don't leave it to the morning. This is what you've been waiting for.

Now, if you're still considering it, let me put a few things on the table. We've had a mini-Renaissance for the beat 'em up genre in recent times, with River City Girls and Streets of Rage 4 (and its DLC) being two particularly significant highlights of this. I can say with full confidence that Shredder's Revenge stands shoulder to shoulder with these two releases, but with a few important differences. At face value, this game may appear to lack content, with one run reportedly taking about 3 hours to complete, making it shorter on paper than the experiences the other two games offer. This is a gross simplification of what this game offers and it ignores its greatest strengths.

Aside from a multi-difficulty story mode and a traditional arcade mode, Shredder's Revenge offers a whole range of side content that significantly expands and lengthens the game experience. Each level in story mode not only has hidden collectables and side-challenges, it also presents an entirely new element in comparison to past TMNT games: character progression. As you play more and more as your chosen character (of which you'll eventually have 7 options), you will actually level up, boosting HP, access to multiple levels of special attacks and expanding your combat options. This progression is tied to individual characters and is linked to the points scored with each, furthering replayability.

But what is replayability without a game that warrants it? This is another strength of Shredder's Revenge, as the combat is fast, fluid and above all damn fun. I've only played about 2 hours of the story mode so far (completing 10/16 of the main levels), but every part of the game has felt more-ish, and the moment this review is finished, I will indeed be diving back into the game. This is further reinforced by gorgeous pixel art, great graphical effects and some catchy music.

On a subjective note, I have a deeply personal connection to the Genesis/Megadrive TMNT game Hyperstone Heist, and I spent many an hour playing with a dear friend during my childhood. I was apprehensive that Shredder's Revenge might be good, but just wouldn't feel 'right', given this experience. I'm eagerly looking forward to the Cowabunga Collection later this year, but this new entry is absolutely a worthy successor.

There are reports that the net code for co-op is still in the process of being refined, but that's something subsequent patches will hopefully iron this out. My perspective on the game might change after a few more runs (and eventual co-op with local and overseas friends), but at the moment, I'm having an absolute ball, and this is shaping up to be one of the best beat 'em ups I've played.

Absolutely recommended."

Do you like 1980's TMNT?
Do you like side scrolling beat-'em-ups?
Then you will thoroughly enjoy this game.

The Dotemu guys did a great job with the Streets of Rage 4 game and they used all the things they learned from that game and applied them to TMNT: Shredder's Revenge. Production team, if you're listening, please apply your magic to the Golden Axe franchise."

old school fans will notice right away that the controls aren't exactly like the SNES and are a mix of SNES TMNT + Streets of Rage 4, movement speed is in general slower and some air movements are missing (and momentum). it's a more strategic take on what would be your common arcade masher. this is good in my opinion. it also makes it harder. everything else is great. turtle power.

UPDATE: Playing online is super sussy, you have to connect to a remote server (unless you live in the US I guess). best played with remote play with friends. lag was pretty bad for me with a gigabit connection. all strategy goes out the window in multiplayer, as you can just taunt and spam your special move coordinating with your teammates.

Back in the early 90s, as a kid, Beat 'Em Up games were among my favourite genres. Not like we had much choice on the matter but I thoroughly enjoyed games like; Golden Axe, Double Dragon and Streets of Rage.
(for the purists: Yes, I know some of those games are from the 80s but I did not play them in the 80s). None of them however, hold a candle to the best (or most fun) Beat 'Em Up game of all time: ""TMNT - Turtles In Time"".

I am a bit biased though since the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles were my (and many other kids') favourite cartoon series.

Naturally I was filled with joy, knowing there would be a spiritual successor to Turtles In Time in 2022; ""Shredder's Revenge"". Ready for some trip down memory lane, I decided to spend way too much money to play this game and I can safely say that it did not disapoint.

Graphically the game looks amazing, most likely one of the best looking pixel-art games and in combination with the great soundtrack it surely will give you that 90s vibe.

When playing Shredder's Revenge you will notice everything in the game is made in homage to Turtles In Time without adding anything to attract a wider audience. Virtually every TMNT character (bad guy) makes an appearance in this game.
There are some new features compared to TIT; Aside from the 4 turtles, you can choose 3 other playable characters: April O' Neill, Splinter and Casey Jones (after finishing the game). There are quite a few new combat moves + you can dodge roll this time + your characters level up over time.
Also, there is an online mode so you can co-op with strangers (or friends) up to 6 players to extend game length.

Which brings me to probably the only real 'negative' thing about Shredder's Revenge, which is that the game's story mode does not take that long to finish. There are 16 levels, each taking around 7-8 minutes but to be fair this game is still longer than TMNT:TIT ever was.
However, playing with friends, harder difficulties, the arcade mode and achievements can keep you busy for quite a bit longer.

Since the game's price is quite steep at the moment, I do not recommend this game to anyone NOT familiar with 'Turtles In Time' or TMNT in general. For the people that are, it's a fun nostalgic game which you no-doubt will love."

It's a good game if you're looking for a throwback to the old retro-beat'em'up games, but honestly, I just felt a bit empty after completing it. Played it a few more times to max out some characters, but there's really not much content beyond that.

If you're expecting the same level of refinement as Dotemu delivered for Streets of Rage 4, do NOT buy this one, or wait for a sale. You won't get as much enjoyment or replayability out of it.

Overall, it's still a positive review. Seriously, not a bad game, just not what I was looking for."

This is, hands-down, the best Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game.

The game looks and plays much like how some remember the earlier games played (NES, SNES/Genesis, and Arcade), but with higher-fidelity visuals, a better art direction, and with more actions the players can take. Additionally, allowing for 6-player co-op and allowing people to play as April, Splinter, and Casey Jones is a huge bonus. If anyone is itching for some TMNT, this is the game for them.

Things that could be improved: the ""story"" mode is kind of weak. It's padded by collectibles and character-levels, It's unfortunate that they had artists spend time on a fantastic world map when it is barely used. Also, the game is rather ""safe"" in its approach. If anyone is looking for something more than just another TMNT game that's a 2D beat 'em up, then they will likely be disappointed. On the technical side: some of the audio is lackluster. The music is fantastic, but sound effects and voice lines are rather muted.

All that said, I still think this is a worthy purchase especially if it's under $20."

TMNT Shredder's Revenge might actually be the best beat em up I've ever played. Not only do you get to relive the greatness of TMNT beat em up action with 90s style TMNT music whether it's the old metal sound or hip hop sound, but you also get a dodge button! Beat em ups always feel like a ton of RNG because it's only a matter of time before you get hit. In TMNT Shredder's Revenge, there actually is a skill check!

If you like the old TMNT games, this is a must have! You will not be disappointed!"

This is a timeless classic for all TMNT and arcade lovers. Graphics and sounds were pretty good, very retro. Like most fighting games, you can randomly press the buttons and surprise yourself with combo hits like a pro. Half the time I didn’t know what I was doing and still won.

Heroes in a Half Shell

Follow our Curator page, Summit Reviews, to see more high-quality reviews regularly.

Visiting the American arcade scene in the mid-to-late 1990s always featured two staples: beat ’em ups and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. There were two main Turtle arcade cabinets: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and then later, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Turtles in Time. Both cabinets served to legitimize the particular arcade they were held within. Eventually, a beautiful symbiosis began to emerge from the Turtles and their trendy beat ’em up grouping. These were quick games with limited buttons, so they were efficient in both moving people on and off machines swiftly and being simplistic enough for everyone to play.

But nothing lasts forever. Eventually, the arcades shut down and the kids who grew up loving these characters, well, grew up.

Now, 31 years later, we finally have a sequel.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge took on the monumental task of creating a follow-up from a genre mostly considered dead, for a property that’s popularity peaked around 1992. So, how did they fare?


Beat ’em ups died for a reason. The evolution of video games from an arcade market to a home console market led to the advent of more nuanced intangibles. This paradigm shift necessitated longer playtimes and more intricate systems within the games themselves. But the genre’s problems are no less true today. So, the success of Shredder’s Revenge would always, and ultimately, be determined by how well it navigated the genre’s inherent pitfalls.



The issues are twofold: 1) Beat ’em ups are short, so where is the value? 2) They’re repetitive, so what keeps you playing?

To combat the length problem, the game comprises 16 different levels that can be completed in or around 2.5 hours, which is very long for a traditional beat ’em up. To address replayability, the game utilizes seven playable characters that all featured prominently in the comics, cartoons, and movies: Leonardo, Michelangelo, Donatello, Raphael, Splinter, April O'Neil, and Casey Jones (unlockable upon the completion of the story). All of which play differently from one another.

Both the longer-than-traditional playtime and the option to select from an abundance of different characters manifests a holistic approach to addressing all of the above pitfalls. Especially in conjunction with the ability to punish baddies with five additional friends within the confines of interactive, exceptionally colorful environments, to the tune of radical ’90s synth beats.

Like Dotemu’s Streets of Rage 4 (2020) offering prior, everything just works.


As mentioned, Shredder’s Revenge makes an outstanding effort at keeping gameplay fresh. Every character will have a unique playthrough, not only via small differences in their moveset, but also because of their different statistical capabilities. Each selectable turtle (or rat, or person) is assigned ratings based upon their range, speed, and attack power. And if you’re familiar with the IP, then the attributes make sense—Leonardo is the best all around, Michelangelo has the best speed, Donatello has the best range, Raphael has the best attack power, etc. There are 21 set moves that each toon employs with added power-ups and team attacks, taunts, and situational nuances (like hitting a shuriken back in the face of its sender). And your timing on each move is essential to your survival in later levels when the enemies become their most varied, as every enemy (differences usually denoted by color) has different tells, attacks, speeds, and aggressiveness. The developers understood that enemy variety was the simplest way to keep things fresh, and Shredder’s Revenge unleashes tons of variability.

In Story Mode, each character will level up the more you use them. Additional perks come in the form of new attacks, added hit points, or extra lives. Moreover, this pads the game’s length because completionists will want to pursue leveling up all their heroes to max level.

More attuned turtles become particularly important in the endgame when simply mashing the attack button no longer suffices. In these situations, you’re going to have a much easier time, especially solo, with your highest-leveled toon.

I ended up getting “shell shocked” on level 13 because my turtle simply wasn’t ready. Poor Donny…



But fear not, Shredder’s Revenge uses a world map in Story Mode. This assists the player in leveling up turtles by allowing players to revisit previous levels, move on to new ones, or check on their statistical progress (and achievements) in the “Turtle Lair.” This is not earth-shattering stuff, but for a beat ’em up, it’s still unexpected. More than just being practical (and fun) it adds, granted superficially, an RPG element that previous entries did not/could not consider.

The game also features an Arcade Mode, which many fundamentalists will consider the “true” way to play. Characters are given a limited amount of extra lives, and they’re tasked with completing the game in order, start to finish, with a Game Over being just that—game over.

Nostalgia, along with the fear of death or losing progress, is paramount in making this genre viable. Arcade Mode encapsulates both.


While Shredder’s Revenge is no doubt one of the best in its category and, more specifically, the best Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game, there are areas that could have been improved immensely simply by their expansion. Ironically, these issues are only evident because Shredder’s Revenge implemented the concepts in the first place. Things like collectable side quests, leveling up, and achievements are all minimalistic in scope. Which is odd when one considers that the developers took the time to draw so much attention to them.

The collectable quests are reduced to easily found items hidden under trash cans, doors, or fire hydrants you’ll likely break on accident without any real attempt at sleuthing. Once you collect them, you turn them in. And then…that’s it. A few points are rewarded, and you get one extra line of script, but nothing substantive. Separately there are 30 achievements in-game, which is a fine amount for a beat ’em up, but when the game places major emphasis on completing them (via the Turtle Lair), the amount suddenly feels unusually lacking.



Then there’s leveling up, which is a wonderful touch that I am happy (and surprised) exists. But it's precisely because it exists that the rigid linearity of its progression becomes very noticeable. If it’s going to be there, it would have been preferable to have some choice on how our turtles evolve. Shredder’s Revenge is simply not interested in providing that.


It’s remarkable that a game like this can be so fun, refreshing, and relevant in 2022. Especially given that the IP has reached such an advanced age so many years after its popularity peaked. But it does. In fact, it manages to wholly squeeze every last drop of “turtle soup” out of the franchise and establish itself as the best version of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, in gaming, to date.

Without the slightest hint of a doubt, this is one of the greater beat ’em ups of all time.

Considering the additions brought into the fold, the ability to access six-person co-op, the lovingly implemented tweaks to illuminate its pertinence, along with its sincere mixture of nostalgia, this is (weirdly) as good a time as any to play a Ninja Turtles game.

I've been looking forward to playing Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge ever since it got announced and I'm going to be 100% honest with you; my expectations were pretty low due to Tribute Games. I've played another game by them last year which is called Panzer Paladin and it was pretty generic with repetitive level design and game mechanics. At the same time, I was kinda hopeful since beat 'em up genre overall is repetitive and I felt like they finally found the direction they should aim for and I've gotta give it them, they did a pretty solid job with this title.

It's mostly based on the 80s cartoon and it feels like watching several episodes of the show. It starts off with Krang setting up a trap for the turtles and Shredder's running the show behind the curtains to get his revenge. Why he wants revenge from the turtles? I have no idea since his motives were never explained. However, it's Shredder afterall and it's pretty clear why he has beef with the turtles, nonetheless, I've been trying to find a real reason behind his hatred specifically for this game but I guess it got something to do with the cartoon and it's been a long time since I watched that one.

Gameplay is your typical beat 'em up. Nothing more, nothing less. It's only natural that it will get compared with Streets of Rage 4 by many people since Dotemu is the publisher but let me tell you that sadly, it doesn't have a revolutionary gameplay like Streets of Rage 4. So, it's safer to set your expectations based on that fact. You get to play as 7 characters and all of them have Ninja Power bars that start with 1, and goes up to 3 as you level up your character. Ninja Power is used to unleash special attacks that I consider very broken at the moment. When you fill up all 3 of your bars, you get to enter a Super Saiyan state which gets obsoloted by regular specials since it's impractical to use it when your regular specials deal more damage in more guaranteed way. This is, of course, a personal preference. Levelling up is also pretty easy and fast which is a plus in my book. However, taunting fills up your Ninja Power bar and it's the most broken thing in the game. It can be cheesed to melt down your enemies easily.

So, how does it compare to Turtles in Time and other TMNT games you ask? It's been a long time since I played that one but I can safely assume that Shredder's Revenge is the best beat 'em up TMNT title out there at the moment. Its gameplay, soundtracks, story and its nostalgia elements do what they're supposed to do very well. The only thing I ask of Dotemu to make the soundtracks of their games available to buy on Steam. They are really good and they fit with the gameplay very well. Whether you're a TMNT fan or not, I can almost guarantee that you will find some enjoyment in this game. Co-op also works very good, at least on my end."

I remember watching the 1987 show when I was very little. It was airing at the 90s at that time and I could still remember that show. I even played the 2 arcade games of it. When they announced the game that was based on that show, I immediately brought it at the first go and when I played it, I do not regret even a bit into buying it.

All the things that were shown on the 1987 shown were there. The antics of the bosses and the enemy soldiers. The 90s things that we had before like Game Boy, VHS, Pizza Power, etc. Heck I even cried at one point because of the nostalgic that overflew towards me.

Now on to the game play. The fact that we could now play as April and Splinter in addition to the 4 turtles is a big thumbs up. Each character has different stats which gives the replayability value. We can pull out some crazy chain of combos and air combos as well as pulling out special attacks even on mid air. Heck you can even taunt and I really liked the taunt stance of different characters. The main thumbs up is the co-op where you can heal the other player when they get knocked out and can even cheer at them. The graphics really remind me of the 1987 show with the touch of some modern standards. All the characters that were on the 1987 show were there in which made me really happy. And let's talk quickly about the music and I will say that the opening theme and the Panic in the Sky Stage music are absolutely my favorite.

It's a must have for those who have memories of the show and its games. A big thank you to the developers for making this awesome game which brought my memories back of the 1987 show and games.

Playing this game instantly brought back memories of me playing TMNT, Battletoads, Double Dragon, and Streets of Rage, with my little brother on the NES and Sega Genesis in the early 90s. Luckily this game doesn’t feature TMNT’s ridiculous water level or Battletoads' sadistic peed bike level. The graphics are perfect, the controls are great, the soundtrack is awesome (especially the Wu-Tang stage, and the Shredder stage), and the levels and overworld map are fun to navigate. I’ve played through the story mode with all 7 characters and have played through the arcade mode multiple times solo and many times in multiplayer and I’ve enjoyed every bit of it. This game is so much fun.

There are a few things I wish existed though. I wish there were more playable characters. I wish that you did not lose your 7 character’s progress in story mode when you start a new game. I wish you could see the difficulty level of the online arcade game you are joining. I wish there were cumulative stats you could see for arcade and story mode that showed the number of times you completed a stage, how many enemies you knocked out, objects you’ve destroyed, stage times, combo streaks, times taunted, etc. I wish you could create your own turtle and assigned moves, specials, jumps, taunts, and colors."

+ Controls are smooth
+ Animations are great
+ Integrated multiplayer works well enough

Cons
- Taunt system is poorly designed. Every taunt gives you a full super. Devolves into run away, taunt, then super over and over at times.
- Charge attacks are super restrictive to the point you never use them
- Throw attacks have no invulnerability making them too risky
- Chill and Okay difficulties are way too easy, even for players brand new to beat em ups

This is going to be my very first review ever written on Steam but I just can’t stay silent about this particular game anymore. I’ve been playing this game almost everyday since launch and I still have not gotten tired of it. Not by a long shot. What can I say other than it’s just a flat out masterpiece. Rarely do I ever get so enthralled in a beat em up game that I play at least one session (most of the time multiple sessions) almost everyday for months. I really only have one major complaint about the game and I’ll get to that. But first I want to point out all of it’s good points.

Game play
The game play is fantastic. Even though I must have beaten the game all the way through over 100 times by now I still don’t get tired of running through the game. One of the biggest draws is of course the 6 player online co-op. If you manage to get into a game with 5 other people it can get really chaotic in the best of ways. Maximum fun for everyone weather it’s with friends or just other players looking for a session. Easily hop in and out of a game with little to no complications from what I’ve seen. Combos are fun to execute and there’s always enough Foot Clan members for everyone to pummel into the ground. Bosses always offer a challenge even with 6 people together. Never a dull moment with this game.

Graphics
Animation is great to watch. Characters and settings are beautiful and vibrant. Really brings a sense being back in the 80s. This game has some of the most beautiful pixel art I have ever seen in 2022. All characters look and feel completely different from each other no matter what they happen to be doing. Even when they just stand there I’ve never felt like I was looking at a copy/paste of anyone. I never get tired of watching the fights that go on at any point in the game.

Sound and Music
Along with the game play this is another huge draw for this game. The music is just fantastic. Again really brings a sense of going back in time to the 80s when coupled with the animations. Each piece was masterfully created to suit each level and some of them even have lyrics. Tee Lopes really outdid himself with the soundtrack of this game and I’m hard pressed to find another game this year to rival it. I can guarantee you that some of these songs will be stuck in your head for a good long while after you’ve given them a listen.

Switching gears for a second. The voice acting is another thing I have to pay homage to because it’s just great. Everyone sounds almost exactly like they did in the 80s cartoon and there is tons of witty quips and commentary from everyone along the way. As well as a few call back lines from the show and even some of the old TMNT games. I had a blast listening to everyone banter and I’m sure anyone else who gives this game a try will feel the same way.

One Major Complaint
Now I mentioned earlier that I had one big complaint about the game. Keep in mind that this isn’t the fault of the actual game or developers but more of a community problem. But it’s a major one for me personally. That problem being the one particular hot headed turtle we all know as Raphael. It does me no joy to talk ill of Raph because he is my favorite turtle but I very much feel this should be addressed as it has easily ruined many sessions for me over the months I’ve been playing this game.

It’s no surprise that there is at least one overpowered character in beat em up games that can pretty much whip through the entire game with very little button work on the player’s part. That honor in this game goes to Raphael. Almost everyone who uses Raph plays in the exact same fashion which always has me cringe when someone enters my session as him and making me wish I could just ban him most of the time. He has the shortest taunt animation out of all the characters. It’s literally like 2 seconds. Then since his power stat is set to maximum, his Sai Cyclone super becomes a controllable death spiral that pretty much one shots any Foot Clan unlucky enough to be caught up in it’s path. It’s range is also quite large surprisingly covering a significant amount of the screen and as I mentioned before, it’s controllable. Meaning you can move around while using it. So for Raphael users it becomes a simple 2 button spam fest. Taunt then Super and repeat. They do this all throughout the level and boss fights making the game trivial and boring for anyone else in the session.

Of course it makes sense for Raph to be so strong because he is the hot head of the group so I don’t blame the devs. It’s the player base more or less that is at fault here and I’m sure many people who have played online before know what I’m talking about. Of course the easiest solution to this problem is to just kick spammers but about 95% of players play Raphael in this manner and if you like to play with a full party of people as I do then you’ll most likely have to put up with it for the most part. I kind of wish Raph’s Super would get toned down or nerfed a little bit or even make his taunt animation last a little longer (kind of like Casey or Donatello who have pretty long animations) but that will probably never happen sadly.

Other than that major flaw though I have no issues with this awesome game and I’ll continue to play it for a long time to come. If anyone is still on the fence about getting the game, don’t be. I can guarantee you it is will worth it to pick up. Don’t mind the Raphael Spammers. They are just one side effect to the awesome game play. As a person who has been playing since launch this game gets a solid A+ all across the board.

Edit: With the release of the new Custom Mode, the issue with the over spammers has been solved. You can now completely turn off the restoration of supers via taunting. I really now have no complaints about this game and fully recommend it to anyone who is still on the fence about buying it."

This game gets ALL the yes from me! I'm 34 years old and been gaming for most of my life. Beat em ups are my 2nd favorite genre, 2nd only to RPGs. This game beats Streets of Rage 4 for me. No contest, and I LOVE SOF4! Enough good cannot be said about this game, and it STILL has room to grow.

If you are thinking about it, stop, just buy it. Stop trying to find a whiny, rare negative review here, and trust the overwhelmingly positive reception its getting. It is for good reason.

What more do you need to know about a Beat 'Em Up style game? Mash the buttons, knock out all the different colored Foot Clan members, beat mini-bosses at the end of each level and then save The Big Apple by 3AM - Or well in this case... 3PM!

TMNT Shredder's Revenge is easily a 10/10 for what the game offers in this small, well rounded package. Albeit my only tiff with the game at release was it's length and price. It honestly felt like a fair and justified complaint at first, but the more I played it, the more I noticed the clear and obvious care, love and passion the developers put into this game. It is a very polished and complete experience from start to finish. Collectibles of all sorts in each level and even an Arcade style challenge for those who want to go from the first level to the last level in one sitting!

Now I will say it is an absolute MUST that you bring the friends to the show! 4 people to me is the perfect blend of combined abilities and attacks. You can have up to 6, but having done so a couple times can get quite chaotic on the screen! You also can't go wrong with the classic SNES style 2-player mode, either! TMNT Shredder's Revenge has everything you would hope for and a few little extra added bonuses for modernization sake, too!

My last praise for the game is of course it's harmonious and nostalgic, sound kicking soundtrack. You will instantly fall in love with the tracks in this game. Every level has it's own unique track and the musicians did such a perfect job to make the game truly feel like it came out in 1993! If you want to feel like a kid again, then crank up the music volume to 100 while thrashing the Foot Clan! I highly recommend checking out the full soundtrack online.

Is there anything else that needs to be said?! It's the ideal game game for when you just want to sick back with the controller and mash those buttons like you did when playing with your friends and family back in the day!"

Pure nostalgia but it hits the high notes perfectly. If you liked the old arcade game or have any sort of affinity for TMNT, this is a no-brainer. It's a beat-em-up, and as such, it's a little thin on meat, but it feels a hell of a lot longer than that arcade game and the additional characters add some depth to it. My one major complaint is that hitboxes are a little finicky, especially vertically and in the air. I get that they're trying to emulate the arcade feel but that's maybe sticking a little too close to the formula.

Otherwise, it's a pretty great game if you know what you're in for. And kudos to me for not making one TMNT pun this entire review. That's called self-restraint, kids."

Wow, a game that is actually good! This is incredibly rare. The art style is a faithful middle-ground. My recommendation has nothing to do with nostalgia, and everything to do with the developers understanding what a video game is supposed to be about!

- This game respects the player. It doesn't kill you instantly, and provides REAL entertainment.
- It builds faithfully on the pedigree of TMNT games.
- There's no ""try-hard"" BS designed for angry aimless teenagers.
- If something off-screen is about to hit you, you get a warning. But you can still die if you stop fighting.
- Gripes about the special attack are stupid. The special attacks improve on the original game by miles.

The last time I thought this highly of a video game was Shadow Warrior 2. It's quite possible some people will encounter lag / performance issues specific to their hardware + region, but nobody can help that.

The only thing I'm upset about? The glut of indie games with stupid Japanese-style try-hard gameplay clogging Steam caused me to believe that no good games were being developed anymore. It looks like I was wrong, and I'm glad I bought this game. It's definitely short, but in the current market, it's worth every penny."

This is hands-down the best TMNT game I have ever played! As a big-time fan of the original arcade/SNES/Genesis games, I can wholeheartedly assure anyone reading this review that Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge perfectly captures the spirit of the older titles while masterfully improving on the existing formula in every way.

- The combat is faithful to older titles while implementing modern tweaks/mechanics that keep the gameplay feeling fresh.
- The visuals are masterfully crafted and serve the best era of TMNT stories/characters.
- The soundtrack is stellar and full of bops.
- The campaign/arcade mode is beefy and gives players their money's worth.

Even if you don't know anything about TMNT or give two hoots about the franchise, this game is a superb beat-em-up title in its own right and arguably one of the best in the genre.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge is the perfect example of how older titles should be 'remastered/remade/revisited' for contemporary audiences. With how well this game turned out, I hope that the developer/publisher are able to take other game series of old and revitalize them with new life for new/returning audiences!"

AN AWESOME BLAST FROM THE PAST

This side-scrolling beat-em up brings back all the elements that defined gaming in the 90's - the nostalgia is unreal XD

Playing solo is an enjoyable enough experience with awesome retro graphics, a great soundtrack, and polished mechanics. The multiplayer however is where the game really comes to life with up to 6 friends or random online players kicking butt all over the screen (at times it can be difficult to tell where you are amongst the madness!). Finding a group is easy enough and I've been able to hop in games as well as have people join my games.

The story mode has some 'side quest' type elements as well as brief story snippets with a map you can navigate around. Arcade mode is just a straight-up jump in and whoop some ass experience.

10/10 no question."

The game is really good, the only negative thing that people complain about is that the game is short. Beat em ups are short games, and if you rush through the game you will beat it very quickly. The game is meant to be for fun and enjoy in groups. It's not meant to keep you busy. If play it for a while, blow of some steam, and then your done. Plenty of things to unlock in story mode, and it's where the game shines the most.

Now when it comes to it's source, this game holds true and if you like TMNT, you will love this game. If you like beat em ups, then you will love this game. If you are looking for a game that will last 100 hours, and it you consume your live, then this is not your game."

TMNT Shredder's Revenge is one of the best games i've played in the last 10 years. Its not trying to be anything else, other than just a fun game. If you played the original TMNT turtles in time, you'll find this an absolute joy.

The characters each have their own abilities, theres a slight progression system for each character. Coop allows for up to 6 players.

In the 3 hours it took my friend and I to finish the game in coop on the hardest difficulty, We ran into only afew glitches, at the latter half of the game, where my friend couldn't see Shredder and Shredder then couldn't damage him. But minus that, it ran perfect.

The art design is that of which you'd expect. This is just TMNT Turtles in Time but with a new coat of paint and afew new mechanics. The music of the game is fantastic and theres alot of callbacks to the show.

The only ""real"" complaint about the game and what'd prevent me from giving it a 10/10 vs a 9/10, is there isn't really ""alot"" to do, outside of just doing the 16 levels in the game. This isn't a game that you'll be sinking hundreds of hours into, after my first playthrough I finished with 17/30 achievements. And it doesn't change that much with each playthrough afterwards.

All in all, this is a perfect game for a friday night where you just want to sit down with your crew and have a blast for a night once you get that ocassional itch. It doesn't try to change the formula of the beat em up formula, instead it feels like a natural progression.

I hope that we get X-Men and the Simpsons that get this kinda love in the future."

I mean, you know why you're here. This is just a fun side scroller, nothing to add.


Positives:

- It's a great game overall, if you played the SNES game you're in for a treat. If you haven't, you're in for a whole pizza pie.

- Some new enemies to keep you on your toes, not as mashy as you'd think.

- Challenges are fun and make for extra objectives to keep an eye out.

- You can play with up to 5 mates. 6 player co-op madness.

- Super nostalgic and makes for a great love lettre to he original series and 90's pop culture.


Negatives:
- A bit short.

- Expected some branching paths when I read that there were multiple endings but it's just different endings with the characters you clear the game as.


Personal negatives:

- The new art is a bit of a miss for me.

- The npc side missions unlock nothing sadly, and aren't hard to finish if you're breaking everything.

- The addition of supers wasn't needed, they all do the same thing and my first play through was with a mate that spammed them. Reaching top score on every map. The salt was real as they say. If there is an option to turn them off please tell me.

Tl;dr: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge is a successful throwback to side scroller beat'em'ups of the 90's. Get it if that is your cup.

Expect a great game. I don’t know why, but I literally knew from the trailer that the game would be just superb and I was not mistakenю

Pros:
- Excellent visual style and sound design;
— High-quality bitmap with characters from my childhood;
— Good old cartoon April O'Neil design;
— Many levels and opponents;
— Ability to play together in multiplayer;
— 7 playable characters;
— Low price.

Minuses:
— Bugs (which is predictable and fixable);
— Multiplayer sometimes lags (I got 250-400 ping usually), idk how it still feels playable.

I'm just delighted with the final version of the game, they will play it and I don't regret the purchase at all."

I was curious to try out the game, as back in the day I've played a bunch of NES titles and watched parts of the TV show. By the time this review was written, I've finished the game 6 times, including playing on the highest difficulty.

Good Stuff
The combat has the right amount of audiovisual feedback, where all the character moves feel satisfying to perform. No matter which fighter you're picking, the animations are smooth and responsiveness is snappy. It's not too surprising, considering that animation keyframes are inspired by a variety of oldschool fighting games. One thing that does degrade with more players on screen is the ability to determine if you're being hit, as your character's yelp and sprite gets lost in the mishmash of effects and the most reliable way is force feedback, assuming that you're using a gamepad.

The art direction is solid with highly detailed, well animated, and eye-pleasing pixel art, that is consistent throughout the whole experience. It's easy to tell where the playing field is and the backgrounds, while are gorgeous, do not distract from the combat. Environmental hazards and destructible objects blend in well, it's possible to tell some apart by their animation or how they're marked, while a few others are more subtle in that regard. When there are a lot of characters on screen, especially during multiplayer, it's easy to lose track of yourself, but there's a dedicated button that briefly puts a mark above your sprite.

The soundtrack has a retro-feeling soundscape, featuring both instrumental and vocal tracks. Instrumental tracks sound like something out of an era-appropriate arcade cabinet or a home console, except without any channel or instrument limitations, so it's a combination of classic video game sound and modern techniques. The vocal tracks go all-out and aim for the early 90s feel, with professional production quality, so they are fitting and engaging. Example: ""Panic in the Sky!"".

The overall presentation of Shredder's Revenge remains at the top throughout your journey. The consistent high quality art, engaging soundtrack that fires you up for more action, all the references from the TV show, the fact that the original voice actors were hired to reprise their roles, responsive combat with a variety of familiar antagonists, the ability to blast through the game in a 6 player chaotic cooperative playthrough, all of it contributes towards making this a rather compelling game to consider.

The multiplayer system is fascinating, as it allows lobbies to have a mix of local and online players. I can't say I've seen a game before where the host plays, gives another gamepad to a friend, creates an online lobby and invites an online friend together with their own local friends. In other words, it's possible to populate 6 player slots without limiting the game to only online or offline players. This kind of approach to Co-Op alone should turn heads and is a commendable feature.

Shredder's Revenge is a short but sweet kind of experience. If you're looking for replayability, then the game offers character progression system, which is the grindiest part of the achievements. Trying out all characters and mastering the highest difficulty is the end-game and there's nothing beyond it, unless you're going for personal challenges like no damage runs. It's one of those titles that can be introduced to most people that game, so that would be a good way of occasionally revisiting the title.
I'm spoiled by the Streets of Rage 4's endless mode expansion and would like to see one here as well, but it's fine if the game remains as is: the original scope has been achieved, and it's a finished product.

The basic combat mechanics are shared across all available characters, and there are no distinct ""classes"". Since the basic fighting framework remains shared, you can pick whichever character you'd like, and you'll be able to perform more or less the same. Each character has their own speed, attack reach, a few changed attacks, and unique super attacks, but that's as far as it goes. After playing through with all the characters, I couldn't really pick a favorite, since the distinction was minimal.
There's no extra layer of depth that you can experience by having more varied character selection, but this also means that you can easily teach a person how to play effectively, and they're going to have fun within minutes.

Co-Op is a big appeal for a beat 'em up title, and Shredder's Revenge drops the pizza when it comes to online play. I wouldn't recommend playing this game through the online lobby system if you have a good internet connection with friends, as it would be a far better experience for everyone involved to use Parsec or Steam Remote Play.
This applies even if you're in the same country! The game de-synchs and the client's game is compromised: enemies teleport around in an attempt to ""snap"" back to their correct location, enemy thrown objects tend to hit way before they land on the player, bosses disappear or face the wrong direction when running, it's harder for the player to grab the pizza in the moving stages. As a pineapple on the pizza, the game's reported ping seems to be at least twice of what you'd expect to see.
Overall, the online play is not the worst experience ever, and you can finish the game like this even on the highest difficulty, but it leaves an impression that the game is far more buggy than it actually is. With Parsec, however, all of those problems go away and, aside from a bit of extra input latency, the game runs the way it should have been to begin with.

Haven't had any stability problems, no crashes throughout 20+ hours of local and online playtime. Xbox gamepads work well and the general input latency is excellent.
One nitpick that I do have is the scrolling smoothness. During most of my playthoughs I've noticed that whenever the camera moves, the motion contains microstutters, while the hardware utilization is rather low and even the reported frame time graph is often stable. This can be most easily observed during the stage selection screen by moving the turtle van around. I believe this also plagues the scrolling during the stages themselves. Depending on how sensitive you are towards frame pacing, this might be a non-issue for you.

Shredder's Revenge is easily the best TMNT game I've ever played: it's easy to pick up and play, the visual style is appealing and is inspired by the TV show, the combat is responsive and satisfying, the development team went through the trouble of having the original TV cast to reprise their voice acting roles, the soundtrack is period-appropriate, is engaging and fits the game nicely.
What I'd want to see addressed is the netcode utilized in this game, as it's the biggest weakness of this title and is not a fair experience to someone who is joining your lobby. Another nicety would be completely fluid scrolling smoothness. Unfortunately, by the time they will address these issues (if they ever will to begin with), I won't be playing the game anymore.
Finally, I know it's not really in their plans, but an endless mode like in Streets of Rage 4 would be a fun addition to the game. Have turtles be stuck in a new Temperstra arcade cabinet or something.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge is simply joyful.

Having grown up watching the TMNT cartoon in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and played the arcade game and its console version on the NES, I’m definitely the target audience of Shredder’s Revenge. Thankfully, the game does a good job in stirring up happy childhood memories, and features quality of life improvements that befit gamers my age.

Sure, you can play Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Arcade Game on arcade and NES emulators, but that shouldn’t stop you from playing this game. Shredder’s Revenge combines elements of the first NES TMNT game and the arcade titles into an appealing package. From travelling in the Turtle Van on the overhead mission map, to the colourful TV animation art style, to combat moves like throwing Foot Soldiers toward the screen, almost everything about Shredder’s Revenge is designed to remind us of the golden age of video games.

Is capitalizing on nostalgia? Absolutely, but what’s wrong with that? When was the last time PC gamers had a good game? features a Story Mode that saves game progress, so I no longer need to finish the game in one sitting like I did with on an NES that’s on the verge of overheating. There’s also the option to play multiplayer via crossplay, so I can play with my friends who play on PC (via Steam or Epic Games) and Xbox. No need to buy multiple copies of the game for different platforms!



That said, this game is absolutely best enjoyed when played with other people. I had a blast playing with a couple of my friends plus a few random strangers who joined our session. The game rewards teamwork, allowing players to revive fallen teammates, share health, and execute team attacks. It’s a refreshing change of pace for online multiplayer. I also didn’t experience much lag during online sessions despite my at times questionable Internet connection.

However, I’m not completely blinded by the rose-coloured glasses that is nostalgia. At the time of writing, is lacking in a few areas. While I appreciate the ability to play multiplayer via crossplay, I couldn’t set up a private session so that my friends on Xbox could join. Sessions that I could join had no information about quality of connection and difficulty level. The setup for multiplayer could definitely use more advanced configurations.

As vibrant and charming the graphics are, the accompanying sound effects seem hollow. Dialogues, as well as sounds of hitting enemies and objects, and explosions lack depth, making the action less exciting than it really is. Hopefully the developers will patch the game up with better quality sound files in the near future.



Lastly, as one of my friends pointed out, what does offer after you’ve finished the game? As a team of five, we finished Story Mode at normal level of difficulty in about 3 hours. While I’m incentivize to complete the various side missions and try out other playable characters (especially with Casey Jones unlocked after finishing Story Mode), not all players would feel the same. As a result, as fun as is, I can see how some players would find the game lacking post-endgame content at the time of this review.

Flaws aside, I found easy to pick up and play. It’s a delight to play a game that doesn’t demand huge commitment of my time, but still delivers on the fun. At the same time, discovering new combat moves by button mashing, noticing nods and homages to previous games, seeing characters that I haven’t thought about since the 1990s, being able to finally play as Splinter, April O’Neil and Casey Jones in a game, working as a team to unleash super attack moves on enemies, and relishing the chaotic combat in six-player multiplayer sessions have also brought me much amusement. It’s very satisfying to play this game.

If you’ve ever been interested in as a kid, pick up and give it a go. I’m hopeful that the developers will polish and bulk it up with future patches and additional content or game modes. Still, even as it is at the time of writing, this game is worth your attention and time. What are you waiting for – go kick some shell!"

So many classic Turtles references, it's 6 player, online co op 16 levels and so much more.
I have been playing with my 6 year old son and he now loves Turtles and playing the co op with his dad. Absolutely awesome game and a fantastic old school side scrolling beat em up!"

I really LOVE this game, I am old as dirt (44) and remember the day ninja turtles hit the TV""S of the early 80's!
This game has tid bits of the old school arcade game to give you that feeling of familiarity while being something very new!
This game is very beautifully crafted by people that understood what this meant to so many fans, they did not disappoint!

The combat system is smooth and feels very diverse in that all the characters have something a little special, each their own talents. It is an extremely solid BEAT'EM UP that anyone of any age can get into!

The art and story telling are also very clean, I like how things like that intro is almost like the old show but not! they were inventive without forgetting what they were making!

Most of the voices are spot on, my only gripe about the game is that all the voices are pretty spot on EXCEPT Raphael his voice sound like the second gen voice actor and its not quite the right rasp in his tone! A very small grip I know but its all I got!

So if you like beat'em ups or TMNT or anything cartoonish and fun you should give this a GOOOO!

YES my favorite turtle was always Raphael!

The games is still great even months after its release, just all around good old school wholesome fun for the whole family!"

short but so satisfying , totally worth it's price.

Ninja Turtle always had great beat e'm up games in the 90's and this game is a great surprise , The visuals style is great , the animations are smooth , the controls are great and the action is fluid.
you get everything that made games like Tmnt Turtle in Time great and even more.

the sountrack really fit the game mood in a extremely good manner and the overall tone of the game really feel like a modernise interpretation of the old Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle cartoon.

you'l be going , beating and combo your way throught 16 stages of pure fun and non-stop actions , this game get you and never let the action drop till the end in this very fast pace ride.

it's the kind of game I know I'll be playing and replaying many time and never get bored."

200 character summary
Jackbox Party Pack 3 is another nice collection of party games for 1 - 8 players locally. Like the first 2 it has the same great narrator knows the right thing to say, A must have for party lovers.

Jackbox Party Pack
Like the first 2 games this game consists of 5 party games, Quiplash, Trivia Murder Party, Guesspionage, Tee K.O. and ♥♥♥♥♥' It. Like always some are awesome and some are a bit less amazing, I will write a bit about each one of them. I will start with the better ones and work towards the rest.

We have covered this game before in JBPP2 It is the same game, new questions. Quiplash 2 can be played with 3 - 8 players Here ever round every player gets 2 questions where there are no right answers, Just funniest answers, Afterwards everyone gets presented the questions one by one with the given answers. Everyone is able to vote on the best answer, Best is ofcourse relative, Sometimes the choice can be hard, Sometimes there is a split in the room, It is funny to see what other people think is funny.

This is the third Quiplash game, Quiplash 1 was the first and Quiplash XL was that game with all DLC and some extras, Quiplash 2 is a completely new game, So if you liked any of the earlier Quiplash games your should certainly get this one. It just gives you new questions, It is like they say; If it ain't broke, Don't fix it.

Guesspionage can be played with 2 to 8 players, The game is about guessing the percentage of people who do or believe something, It can be very personal or sometimes even holy, One needs to guess and then the rest can say it is higher, lower, much higher or much lower. The closer you are to the real number the more points you get.

What makes this game fun is the reaction, People mostly show a little faith in humanity but get disappointed in the end, But how disappointed will they be, It is very hard to guess what the general public thinks, It creates a lot of, Noooo, Really? Wtf.. moments. I don't know where they got these polls, but some results are pretty flabbergasting.

Tee K.O. can be played with 3 to 8 players, Here you have to design your own T shirts by drawing something and writing some text. There will be some voting and afterwards they will battle it out Mortal Kombat Style, Shirt vs Shirt. You just have to pick one of the 2 shirts on the screen and the shirt with the most votes wins. There is also a bit of a pokemon vibe in there somewhere.

The game can spark a lot of laughs, And some shirts designs are so good that they should be printed in real life, Maybe Jackbox should strike up a deal with T shirt printing companies. Mostly the drawings end up a bit primitive, but the punchlines are mostly funny.

Trivia Murder Party can be played wth 1 to 8 players, It is like a Trivia Pursuit game with a spooky horror theme, It is a great Trivia game with some extreme measures if you answer a question wrong. People get taken apart often to battle it out. Only 1 person can escape and be the winner

This game is a lot of fun, It has a lot of side steps compared to a regular trivia game, It is kind of brutal, Answering a question wrong can cost you one of your fingers or your life, It succeeds at creating a lot of tension, but blows it off with the funny comments of the narrator.

♥♥♥♥♥' it can be played with 3 to 6 players, Here everyone gets asked a few questions, But one person gets different questions which have the same type of answer, lets say the answer is a number or a month. It is up to the group to figure out who the faker is, If the faker does not get caught he scores a lot of points, The other players get points by voting on the real faker. Everyone will be the faker once, So it is important you do not reveal yourself if you did not get caught.

It is funny to see how people behave different when they are the faker, Some people can hide it pretty well, The answers might give you a clue, Things can look extremely out of place, It is a bit of luck, but a good way to get to know people.

The game runs fine, It is not that we need the framerate, but 30 fps feels like a slideshow when you are used to 120. The game has absolutely no issues, crashes or bugs, The online connectivity works great and using your mobile phone as a controller works just as fine, Surely there is a small lag, But it is barely noticable and it won't make a difference in first or second place.

The third game in this collection is a great one, I still think the first 2 collections where better, But this one is certainly not one to be missed, It has 5 more unique games to play with your friends. If you like party games it is a must have."

It's a very solid collection of party game. In short, there's a bit of everything: creative games, a trivia game, a more social one and I guess a nerdy one.

Quiplash 2 is as fun as ever (for those who don't know the first one, it's basically a game where you have to answer a prompt; like Cards Against Humanity, but with complete freedom on your answer). It's a bit more demanding on the creative side than the other games though, so it's best to play when everyone feels energetic.

♥♥♥♥♥' It is probably my favorite game of the collection, and the most ""social"" one. Each player sees a question on their screen and has to answer it after a countdown (it can be by raising your hand in a yes/no question for example). The trick is that one of the players is a faker and cannot see the question, so they have to try and guess what they should do. People have to find out who the faker is, so you might have to justify yourself if the others find your answer suspicious and very unlike you...

The Trivia Murder Party is a trivia game with people being eliminated each round or so, and playing mini-games in between rounds to see who should survive. The formula is fun, but I have to admit that my friends and I don't know the answers to most of the questions, so it's a bit annoying and it's mostly a guessing game (maybe it's because we're not Americans or that we're not the age target, I don't know).

Guesspionage is interesting. Players have to guess a percentage on a variety of statistics (they're not dull statistics, but things based on surveys like ""How many people wear a hat on a bad hair day?""). The closest you are to the actual number, the more points you gain.

Finally, Tee K.O. is the weirdest of the lot. You have to design a couple of shirt logos, then write up a couple of slogans. Afterwards, all the submissions from all players are shuffled, and you're give different combinations. Find the funniest, and then people have to vote. It's not the most competitive game, and it's really unique."

I've loved every edition of Jackbox, and this is no exception. Always a great source of entertainment and it's so easy to play! Also fantastic new game additions!

My only gripe would be that this version seems more 'Americanised' than Jackbox 2, me and my mate both agree there should be the ability to turn off specifically American questions, or at least have more ""General"" questions. We went through a lot of questions in Jackbox 3 that we had absolutely no idea about, which kind of brought the mood down a little which we never found in Jackbox 2.

Still love this game though, can't wait to play it again this weekend!"

Since there are 5 party games in one game I'm going to be reviewing them all and thankfully for me, I have tried out all the games whether that be sacrificing my friends' time to play some of these games or playing it with my family members.

Let's first start off with Quiplash 2: Whether it be family members, college mates or steam users this game is crowned as the best thing in existence. This just like the first predecessor is really fun and enjoyable, there are lot of new things that haven't been introduced in the first game, such as the fact that you can create your own prompts, I have so far 2 episodes I made with a lot of crazy prompts such as ""help! A gargoyle stole my cheese pizza"". There's also new weird characters that you randomly play as such as a weird turqoise cat or a gray vampire coffin or a yellow (demonic voiced?) star. They also changed The Last Lash level, instead of getting a prompt you're given either an acro prompt, a comic prompt or a word prompt and not only that players award the answers in medals so that is something new.

Up next is Trivia Murder Party: This game is one of those trivia fact game host show things that would see on your television. Only Trivia Murder Party takes place in a saw themed place where players play as plushies to try and escape, everyone gets a multiple choice trivia to answer, if one or more plushies doesn't the answer correct they would have to survive ""The Killing Floor (not the game Killing Floor) where in The Killing Floor, players/player have to play mini games of death whether it would be answering as much easy math problems as you can or spinning the loser wheel or remembering patterns.

Next up is Tee KO: Tee KO is similiar to Quiplash but only instead of filling out prompts you are drawing t-shirts and filling out slogans for these shirts. Once you've done that, other people are going to use your as well as some other players artworks and slogans to make their T-Shirt. Once they've done that then it's voting time to see what T-Shirt is better than the other one. This game is pretty complicated in my opinion, a lot of people I showed this one were pretty confused by it.

Next it is Guesspionage: Guesspionage is a game that is all about percentages, how high or low it is. One player is given a question and has to estimate what percentage he or she thinks is appropriate for that question. Once they've done that, other players in the game are given two options of whether the percentage should be higher or lower. When they finish doing that the real percentage is given out to players to see if the player given the estimation was higher, lower or spot on. It has some pretty interesting gameplay, I must say.

Last but not least is ♥♥♥♥♥' it: ♥♥♥♥♥' it has a very 60's cartoon look, in this game players have to work together on finding the faker. Players are given tasks on their phones, tablets or laptops while one player (which that player is the faker) gets a different one, it is up to the faker's job to try and blend with the crowd. Some of these tasks are: pointing to one or another, making weird faces, holding up a number of fingers or raising your hand. Once players are told to stop doing these tasks, they have to vote on who the faker really is. This game is definitely NOT recommended to anyone who wants to play this game over online because of these tasks given on your phone.

And now the final conclusion on these games:
Quiplash 2 is great especially that they added the option of creating prompts, Trivia Murder Party is fun, Tee KO is pretty confusing at first but eventually you'll get used to it, Guesspionage is pretty good, ♥♥♥♥♥ it is alright but not terrible.

Overall: buy Jackbox Party Pack 3, buy some beer, buy some friends and have a wicked party.

Cheers"

So far Party Pack 3 has been an absolute blast, just like the previous two incarnations. It is by far the most ambitious, polished set of games so far, and without a doubt Party Pack 3 has the strongest games in the series. Trivia Murder Party is especially great to play, and it can get very intense. Now that I'm in college, it's awesome to go to the game lounge and set it up on the TV. I cannot recommend the series enough, and especially Party Pack 3."
the+jackbox+party+pack+3,Recommended,21.0,"Posted: March 9, 2021
Jackbox Party Pack 3 is a massive step up in quality for the series, however I find it difficult whether to recommend it or not. If you were only able to buy one game in the series, this would be a great choice, however if you intend to buy multiple, there's only really one good game in here that you can't get anywhere else. The 3 major standouts are Quiplash 2, a comedic game where you answer funny prompts and vote for the best answers from your friends, Trivia Murder Party, a trivia game with survival horror elements, and Tee K.O, a game about creating the best T-shirt. However, the first two both have sequels later down the line, leaving Tee K.O. the only major exclusive. The other two games in this package are Guesspionage, a lacklustre trivia game, and ♥♥♥♥♥' It, a mafia-style game that has to be played in the same room, and is outdone by a similar game later in the series. So, if you are looking to get into the Jackbox franchise and want to start with one simple pack to try it out, I would recommend this game. However, if you are already a fan of the franchise and just want to expand your collection, I would just skip over this one. 6/10"

So I’m going to base this review on my personal and my friends’ opinions when we got to play the game together, this is going to be a partial review because we didn’t play ♥♥♥♥♥ it as I’ve read from reviews that the game isn’t fun at all.

Overall, the game is really enjoyable to play with your friends for a couple of hours, this game brought us some laugh out loud moments and really gives you that feeling of togetherness when you have your friends over. What’s great about The Jackbox Party Pack is that you don’t need to prepare anything like extra controllers or anything like that to play with multiple friends on the couch; all you need is a laptop, an internet connection, and smartphones which I’m sure everyone has. What I also like about this game is that it caters to everyone; be it your family or friends, and is relatively easy to get into, as friends who watched for just a couple of minutes would already understand how each game goes (some of my friends aren't really good at english). Now, on to each individual game the pack offers;

Quiplash; This game is the ultimate source of laugh out loud moments that you can have with your friends since it gives you the option to make your own prompts where you can add some inside jokes that are sure to give your group a good laugh.

Trivia Murder Party; This game has the longest lasting appeal as me and friends have played this game over and over for hours without getting bored. However, as many of the consumers have stated, the trivias are mostly ‘American’ trivias that most people who lived outside the US won’t get. For example, the game asks which presidents were democrats and which of these people were once hosts of a show like Family Feud. It’s a damn shame because I really wanted my friends to not get confused 80% of the time by these questions and actually have a clue of what they should choose as the answer.

As you can probably tell from the name of the game, this is a game about guessing, as in guessing percentages. The guessing happens the whole game, it gets boring fast and it doesn’t really give you any sense of competition or achievement when you actually win the game since it basically crowns the best guesser.

My review for this game will be taken by a quote from my friend; “If we drew the shirts and make all the words, why is our shirt just mixed pictures and words taken from someone else’s efforts?”. This game isn’t fun because all your hard work will be used by someone else to win the game and even if you win, you won’t win by using your own drawings; this game is unsatisfactory and the scoring system is really confusing.

, Get this game for Quiplash and Trivia Murder Party, and get it if you have friends who aren’t really into games but is looking to meet up and have fun, or if you have any friends at all for that matter."

TLDR get this pack if you got none yet or you want a good variety of fun casual games to play at a party


Quiplash 2's a great introduction game, and people can understand the rules easily. You're given a prompt - answer it humorously, then fight off against another player who had to answer it. Whoever's the funniest wins by player vote. That's all there is to it - the final round gives every player the same prompt and people vote for the best three answers. A very simple game that does get stale quickly (unlike other player-prompt joke games like StI from pack 4), but one that defines what the Jackbox series is - simple and casual fun.

Trivia Murder Party's questions are varied, and unlike YDKJ, you won't be asked as many questions about obscure pieces of media - the questions are more casual trivia. The catch of this trivia game is that failing a question puts you into a minigame for survival. The more questions you answer correctly and the more minigames you survive, the more cash you get - cash puts you closer to the winning condition at the final round of the game. At first glance, it might seem like the goal is to survive - A catchup mechanic for dead players ensured that survivors and ghosts have the same opportunities to win the game, however. Don't discourage players that died, or they'll catchup and smack you.

♥♥♥♥♥' It is the highlight of this game, and a great cure for social anxiety. Sit around in a circle, preferably with a group of people you know well enough, and start the game. You'll be asked mundane questions, like ""Raise your hand if you ordered food in the last week"". The catch is that one of you doesn't know what the question was, and has to fake it. Figure out who's faking it, and you win. Fail, and he wins. You'll learn quite a bit about which one of you is a good liar, and which one of you would like eggs as a birthday gift. It's a game you should definitely try - even if you fumble or stress when you see you're the Faker, that's part of the fun.

Tee K.O. is arguably one of the better drawing games of the series - although it has little appeal to those who like winning. Players draw a shirt design, write slogans, then receive other players' slogans and drawings. From there, they make ""cool"" shirts and whoever combined theirs the best wins by vote. This game takes a bit more time to get to the fun part, so maybe run it towards the middle of the game night.

Guesspionage is definitely the black sheep of this pack - you're prompted to guess the percentage of a quirky question. Say, what percentage of the population sleeps with a nightlight on? 10? 20? 75? Guess, and the closer you are to the right answer, the more points you get. There's not much else to it, and it could be fun once or twice, but the lack of variety kills this game.

However, one bad game does not discredit the other 4. This pack is, simply put, good. The best one if you're looking to pick one up and you never played Jack before. Newcomers can play Quiplash and TMP, while more advanced players can play ♥♥♥♥♥ and TKO. And no one should play Guesspionage more than once."

Do I recommend the Jackbox Party Pack 3?
- Yes, absolutely.

Individual game review:

Quiplash 2:
- A classic of the Jackbox Games.
- Simple to understand and fun.
- The third round isn't particularly excellent compared to the 1st, let alone 3rd game.
- Includes a mode where you can create your own prompts.
As always, Quiplash is this game where you can play and never get bored of it, as it is just fun no matter what. The 3rd round prompts however don't give as good of an experience, they are often restrictive and difficult to write over. The nice addition is a mode where you can make your own prompts for round 1 and 2 but not for the 3rd, again. My personal note is 7/10.

Trivia Murder Party:
- Trivia based as the name suggests.
- It can still be played around even if you don't know American trivia.
- Very cool, funny and cliche murder theme.
- Very competitive and tense (especially at the end).
Despite being mainly based of American Trivia that is beyond my European reach, the game still can prove very fun especially since you can get away with ignorance thanks to the mini-games that offer survival options. The last round is very tense and the whole game offers a lot of fun, very surprisingly. The 2nd one is even better though, if you have it. Note that the audience plays as an extra player and can win! Personal note is .


- Chill and easy.
- Note that it uses American data.
A good game to play when waiting for more players or in between two intensive games. It calls for the players to guess the percentage of what people do in their daily lives (in the US). Relatively fun and easy to understand. Note that if you're a streamer or just have at least 5 people in the audience, the data is based of the audience's answers! Personal note is .


- Drawing game.
- Can be very long.
- High replayability and unlimited creativity.
- Can be quite fun.
In this game you basically have to create tee-shirts by drawing and writing names then combining the ones of other players. A round can take something like 20~30 minutes, but when the players really put the best of their creativity, it can become hilarious. My personal note is .


- 6 players max.
- Really has to be played in a real life setting with all the players in the same room.
- Some of the tasks are unbalanced (some are too easy to fake, some are too difficult to fake).
- Fun once the players grasp the concept.
The game I unfortunately struggle to play even though it has to be one of my favourites because it has to be played with other people physically present. It really calls for people's knowledge about you to deduce who is the faker and catch them. The first few tasks don't explicitly state who is the fakerr and caught some people out about it, that could be fixed. Personal note is .
(note, Faking' it and fakerr is to prevent the automatic swear filter from acting in what are not swear words...)


An overall good and consistent pack of interesting games. Definitely not the best of them but a very solid one at that. Highly recommended to have at one point in your collection."

Again, as always, Jackbox has produced a great group of really fun games to play. Some of them are especially great

Trivia Murder Party is great fun and tense as well-it really makes you double guess your own actions and your friends actions.

Quiplash 2 is just as great as the original, probably better in fact. You can write your own prompts and the game is just improved in every way I can think of.

Tee K.O. is an interesting concept of a game, where you design a few t-shirts and then come up with a few random titles-someone else will pair the two and then it will be voted on and the person who paired them will win, not the person who designed it, which we found odd but interesting. This doesn't make the game any less fun though, it is a great game

♥♥♥♥♥' It is also a good game-however, you need to be able to see each other perfectly. Considering we were playing over Skype and therefore I could only see one person at a time because I was sharing my screen, this made the game a bit more difficult and so we agreed to say what we would do. It is an interesting game though, where there a different rounds that you can pick-for example, you will have to write something, hold up a certain number of fingers or point at someone. Everyone gets given the same prompt to do something, apart from the faker who either gets given a roughly similar prompt (for example in the writing round, one prompt was ""the last book you read"" whereas the fakers was ""your favourite childhood book"") or no prompt at all and they just have to try a persuade people that they are not the faker. However I am not entirely certain how the points system works.

Another good point is that once you have finished the game and select to play again with the same players, it will remember and you will not have to sit through the introduction again-in fact, in the Trivia Murder Party this is incoperated into the game and if you lost in the previous game-and thus ""died""-it will add ""Jr"" to the end of your name.

As well as this when you log onto the Jackbox.tv website and join a game, the format of the webpage will change dependent on what game you are playing, which is a nice feature.

You also have the ability to look at the answers at the end of the game via the webpage. In Tee K.O. It even gives you the option of buying the T-Shirts that everyone so lovingly designed.

All in all, another great Jackbox Party Pack that is super fun to play with friends, with new more experimental games that are just great fun to play with your friends."

Jackbox is back. If you liked the first two you'll love this.

Tee KO and Quiplash 2 are easily my favorite games of the entire Jackbox franchise. I do wish this had another entry of Fibbage but I own the first two games anyway so it doesn't matter.

PROS

-Great for having company and it's easy to pick up for people of all ages.

-Using your smartphone as a controller is seamless and downright awesome.

-The gamemodes are sometimes influenced entirely by the creativity of those you play with, so each new player adds their own personal twist to the fun.


(singular)

-You can't play it by yourself.


Hook this game up to your living room TV, gather some family/friends. Jackbox is always a laughing-out-loud damn good time.

The PERFECT awkward time filler at a social 3+ gathering.

I was raised in a very Italian family. My grandparents spoke Italian more often than English despite them both being born here in the US. A very conservative and very Catholic sort of crowd, the whole lot of them. So when I went to visit my grandmother and she stopped me before entering the house to sit me onto a foldout lawn chair the last thing that I was expecting was the conversation that followed. She started by telling me (at the time a young boy of 13) that I might have hair on my balls... ""What grandma?!"" I replied. She continued ""Just let me talk for a bit- You might have noticed some hair on your balls. I noticed that you have some puffy nipples and I was afraid that you were growing breasts.""
""Wh-Why are you saying this, grandma? I don't have breasts"" I asked.
""Well I asked my doctor about your puffy nipples and he said that you might have hair on your balls"" she stated.
""Why are you talking about my balls and nipples?"" I wanted to run away so badly.
""What was I supposed to do? Am I just supposed to have a grandson with boobs?!"" She exclaimed.
""Can we stop whatever this is?"" I pleaded.
""It's called poOOoberty and some boys get puffy nipples but not breasts"" she continued.
""It's called puberty, grandma. And I know. I'm good. Thank you.""
This is how nipples destroyed my family. Because before that day I had a lovely grandmother that didn't talk about my balls and nipples. Then I came of age. The age of adulthood where your grandmother with bad English talks to everyone about your nipples. Doctors, Aunts, Uncles, cousins- They all heard of my puffy nipples... I wish that I had grown breasts. It would have made the stress worth it.
Jackbox 3 is your puffy nipples. A coming of age tale that might possibly destroy your family. But if you're lucky you'll come out of it with a new set of breasts.... Or something."

This was the game that got me into playing Jackbox. I would frequently play this at friends houses for game nights and we would usually come close to peeing ourselves laughing. In 2020 I started streaming during the initial lockdowns to keep in contact with my bar trivia audience, albeit virtually. Jackbox was a wonderful stream game despite the delay that Twitch has. So it wasn't perfect but myself and many others had a great time. Also, the selection of games in here is actually really solid. Some of the later Jackbox releases haven't been my favorite but Quiplash, Tee-K-O, and Trivia Murder Party make this the standout party pack. I highly recommend picking it up for family or friends.

The second best entry in the Jackbox Party Pack series, the third installmant yet again features five whacky party / trivia games which can lighten up the mood pretty much anywhere except within an Amish community. They hate computers and stuff you know

In Quiplash 2 you unleash your gift of gab even more than in the first entry, adding hundreds of new questions to the already quite vast title with the ability to put in even scores of your own custom questions.

Trivia Murder Party mixes the usual YDKJ trivia quiz with minigames if you answer wrongly, spicing up the quiz but ultimately turning out to be the weakest entry of this collection. Still, ""weakest"" means it is still lots of fun for quite a few rounds with friends.

In Guesspionage you guess about statistical values. Awesome for statistic nerds but might be mildly uneventful for most other people. The friendship ruination factor is minimal here

Tee K.O. combines elements from Drawful with elements from Quiplash. You design your own T-Shirt with a witty catchphrase and use it to battle other peoples designs. Extremely fun until creativity starts taking a downward spiral, which, depending on the people you're playing with, could take forever or mere minutes.

♥♥♥♥♥' It is a digital alternative to Truth or Dare, but just being Truth or Lie. Each player is assigned a role and has to answer depending on their role. The aim of the game is for the group to correctly guess who has been assigned the liar role. A really great title to embarass other people or just simply learn more about them. Usually both at the same time. The second best entry in this pack in my opinion and one of the most interesting games in the entire series.

The Jackbox Party Pack 3 has probably the most balanced out games of the packs and is definitely worth your time if you're a fan of trivia and party games."

Really fun pack of party games. Loved Tee KO the most, Quiplash is always fun. Murder Trivia would be much better if it wasn't so focused on the American (pop)culture. Maybe we were just really unlucky with the questions.

Tee KO was really fun for the kids (I'm a teacher). I wish there was an option to edit/customize the Murder Trivia questions. Would be an amazing teaching tool!

Amazing fun if you have friends/family to play with. I would say this pack is the best out of the 3 on sale. Get it with a standalone Drawful 2 and you're set for tons of entertainment!"

i've played all four packs, and this pack is probably the second best one. i'll go over each game individually:

Quiplash 2:
in this game, you get a prompt and try to answer it in a funny way. pretty universal game if you're playing with normies. highly recommend this.

Trivia Murder Party:
pretty simple trivia game with minigames if you fail to answer the question correctly. most of the questions come down to pure guess, and some of the questions are way too easy. i guess it heavily depends on the people you're playing with, but overall it's not the best game in the pack, for sure.

Guesspionage:
an estimation game based on statistics. it's a pretty boring game, admittedly, but it's an interesting concept.

Tee K.O.:
a drawing game/write something funny game. the game starts out strong, but lingers off after the first round, and then becomes boring. might be fun if you're playing with a bunch of artsy people.

♥♥♥♥♥' It:
a game where you're given a question and either lie or tell the truth about the question, depending on your role. one of the better games in this pack, it's better played with the max amount of people.

overall, this party pack is alright. not as replayable as 4 though. 7/10"

Don't mind the 10 minute playtime. I have played this game several times on gathering events via other means and finally saw it fall back to its lowest recorded price.

There are games that might intrigue you to try before you buy and this is one of them. As mentioned its really hard to get to know a game or ""games"" until you try them out.

I have family that do not really play computer games(older people) but we tend to always go out together on vacation. This is the best and most fun Computer game they played(along with drawful).

Most of the games in this particular pack are homeruns in family entertainment. Even if you don't speak English you can answer in your own language and still get the Hilarious results you want to have a GREAT time.

The games are played via Phones\Tablets for best results. They are different games but they are mostly fun even for younger and older players.

If you are afraid to use the refund system or try it via ""other"" means. I am giving away 1 Quiplash giftlink from Humble to the first person who wants it, just comment.

Again Do support the Devs and buy the pack you want(or buy all of them) once you tried the games. Just make sure you have decent internet connection and have a blast

Summary:
Absolutely fantastic game pack. Trivia Murder Party and Quiplash are peak Jackbox, Tee K.O. is a hidden gem, Guesspionage is good, although ♥♥♥♥♥' It is badly implemented, but it does have a good idea. But buy the Jackbox Party Starter instead, believe me.

Ranking of games:
- Quiplash: Awesome
- Trivia Murder Party: Awesome

- Tee K.O.: Really great
(The average 5 and earlier Jackbox game goes here)
-Guesspionage: Good


-♥♥♥♥♥' It: Bad

Trivia Murder Party was born here and it's easy to see how it was such a hit. The horror aesthetic really gives it a fancy shine, it's a much better trivia game that You Don't Know Jack, and the challenges you have to do to survive are really varied and interesting. The final round at the end of a game is such a blast that will have your heart . Amazing game, don't skip it!

Quiplash is a classic, and has never been a miss with any group I've played with. At some point a prompt will bring the funny guy in each player, and when a glorious joke happens, it'll turn into an instant inside joke. I liked the final round, especially Comiclash. Definitely great fun for everyone!

Tee K.O. is overlooked by a simple reason: the start of each game doesn't have much going on, just people drawing and writing. That puts a damper on the fun, but the payoff is great: the combinations of the lines and images will sometimes throw out memorable jewels, especially when someone writes/draws inside jokes. Good for playing after Quiplash, then!

Guesspionage has a good concept, but for some reason, it hasn't been a big hit on any group. Regardless, it has been fun and entertaining. The last round is certainly the best! Oddly enough, sometimes the percentage guesses of the whole group are way off. Bias on maybe us, the sampling group (maybe not varied enough) or both?

♥♥♥♥♥' it has potential and not much else, because of really bad implementation. The concept: foolin' friends from knowin' you're the faker by tryin' to explain why you did an action, actions which are varied and will change the game a lot. Really good, right? Except the faker will almost always win because everyone has to choose them at the same time to catch them! The only way to have a chance is makin' a house rule, but that ruins the best sleuth prize and it's a solution outside the game...

9/10

We have to talk about The Jackbox Party Starter. It has the three best games from this pack, except the two best ones are in their recent, improved, final version. Not only that, because of the lower amount of games, it has a much lower price, allowing new Jackbox players to afford it, while being just as good as a whole and way better per game. It's a better deal on every way. Despite how much I love this pack, I would skip it if the Starter Pack was available when I bought it."

Jackbox Party Pack 3 is a collection of party games that can be played by a large group of people using their own devices (such as smartphones and tablets). It includes five games:

Quiplash 2: Players are given prompts and must come up with the funniest or most creative responses. Other players then vote on their favorite responses.

Trivia Murder Party: Players must answer trivia questions to stay alive, but if they get a question wrong, they must participate in a mini-game to avoid being ""killed"" by the host.

Guesspionage: Players must guess the percentage of people who have answered a series of questions correctly.

Tee K.O.: Players design their own t-shirt designs and then vote on their favorites.

♥♥♥♥♥' It: One player is given a secret task that they must complete while the other players try to figure out who the ""faker"" is.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
I don't want to seem too giddy, but I think this has the potential to be what train simmers were waiting for. This is already a good train sim, and it is just the beginning - I am very excited for what is to come.
Dovetail Games had the monopoly over train driving simulation for years now, and we got used to the way they do things. But this is a whole other story, this seems to be a train sim that puts the community at the center.

After just three sessions of driving, I am glad for the many things this sim does right from the get-go. You can FEEL the weight of the train you're driving; the sounds are very good (some trains more than others but still). You have long, proper routes right away, routes that you can easily have a 2-3-4 hour session driving from end to end, none of that 25 minutes and you're out of track nonsense. And the graphics are good, the two routes provided seem detailed and lively. And this is just an early access release.
At first I was disappointed with the routes seeming to be deserted, but then I learned that there is no traffic in single player yet, and when you play multiplayer - you have the full timetable running always, whether driven by other players or by AI. Talking to real people manning the signal boxes, working together to solve issues - all of it is just a joyous experience. My attitude towards multiplayer in train sims was always ""meh"", but just a couple of sessions with this sim had completely changed my mind. It gives a sense of occasion to every drive, and it is probably mostly the way I will play this game going forward.

As for the weird people that are screaming in their reviews that this game is too expensive for early access - they must be delirious. This costs less than one single Train Sim World route addon, after DTG's latest price hike, and it comes with TWO full, long routes and four or five different drivable trains, As opposed to DTG's ""one route one train for more money"" policy. This is excellent value. And I hardly encountered any bugs in the 8 hours I've put into this game so far.

Negatives? No raildriver (or other controller) support, somewhat lackluster tutorials (I still don't know what is the proper set up order for the pendolino), lackluster single player mode (for now) with no AI traffic or ability to set the time, season or weather of a service. Track sounds, outside sounds and cab sway are important features that are not yet properly implemented. But seriously, most of this are things that just haven't been implemented YET, and are probably planned.

Big thumbs up. If the team keeps a steady development pace, this game is going to take over world of train simulation (no pun intended :)). Especially after the editor becomes available and user-generated content starts populating the game."

What is there to say?I've spent 20+ hours as a dispatcher, because I really enjoy the signalling aspect of it, and there's literally nothing to say except ""wow, this FINALLY happened. TSW3 may have a very good competitor"".Fair warning - especially if you're not Polish - you WILL have to do some basic reading to understand the regulations, signage, etc. However, I find it weird how people are complaining!Us polish people have always had to put up with sims that are based in the UK, USA, Germany etc and had to deal with a lack of internal documentation too! We've always had to look up guides, and you WILL have to here as well. That's tough, but the official forum has many incredible player-made guides.TSW, TS etc have one issue - replayability. Sure, you can do different scenarios, but after a while you'll get bored of a route - and buy another one (for money!). The multiplayer here is EVERYTHING I wanted, finally getting the ability to communicate with others and organise things - and wow has it been a joyous experience!Both on English and Polish servers, organising, calling and VC'ing with other dispatchers trying to organise peak times has been incredible. Being able to talk to drivers, help them organise - and from the reverse, being organised while also having to deal with driving is not something I've seen before. Having real people there allows for some really cool operations, like wrong-track driving, double platform departures and depot movements/schedule organisation.The fact that this game has over 300km of actually beautifully recreated track is incredible! Updates happen every 2-3 days with many bug fixes, new signalling zones among other things.CONSThere are some bugs. There aren't many locomotives. The game was meant to come out in full but came out in early access.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Yeah, it might be good to read this before purchasing the game. If you are used to having the world of the train simulators or anything from Dovetail.

I want to start that this game looks really good. The trains are well modeled. Same for the gameplay. It contains realistic sounds. And there are countless routes available for you to take when you start playing online. And to play dispatcher. Who wouldn't want that?

This train simulator is very unique because of its ability to play online. You literally run into each other. Sometimes you have situations where you are at a red signal because the train traffic controller sometimes has difficulty with the busy train traffic. I like that. And realistically done.

There are some drawbacks, it's an early access trial for a reason. The servers the game runs on sometimes need to be reset because it crashes. Also the game itself doesn't run smoothly, every 2 minutes (in my case) I have framedrops. And sometimes everything crashes. So be aware of cases like this, but the developers are actively working on it and patching the game very regularly. So I expect that these kinds of problems will be solved within a few months. Also, not all sounds are equally good in the game. For example, it's better to stay in the cabin with the camera, because that's when the sounds come out best. When you go out of the cabin with the camera, I think the sounds of the train become a bit fake. You don't really hear the wheels going over the rails outside, you don't hear the wind and the engine sound isn't really different from what it sounds like inside when you're outside. Something that will not really happen with Dovetail, because almost all sounds will be present when the package is released.

So all in all, don't think this is Dovetail's second train sim world, but this is a young simulator ready to take on the claim of being one of the best train simulators. I think this simulator has a great future ahead with many improvements, features and trains and routes. I'm very, very excited about what's to come.

Another small thing: the developers don't speak English originally, the tutorial are in English, just like the rest of the simulator. But sometimes they are quite confusing in that they sometimes miss a certain vocabulary to explain something (My opinion), and unfortunately not all trains have tutorials available yet. I therefore advise you to pay close attention, and to use the internet if you can't figure it out.

So I think I recommend the game, but keep in mind the things I've mentioned so you don't expect too much from it. Perhaps it is better to wait until the game is completely finished, and the problems are fixed, to fully guarantee that the game will continue to run and remain fun to play."

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Treat this as more of a neutral review. I don't think it deserves a thumbs down, but I'm not sure I want to give it a thumbs up yet, either.

I played several hours of the game's multiplayer playtest, and despite a tiny bit of jank, I enjoyed it overall. The simulation, graphics, and multiplayer functionality are great (despite some occasional disconnects). There's also a nice variety of complexity within both the locomotives and dispatcher stations.

However, I don't think the game was quite ready for release. The two trains they added since the playtest have no tutorials, some of the text and narration is still in Polish, the audio can be weird at times, and loads of stations don't yet have operable dispatcher booths (meaning the engaging ones are almost always taken). It's also a bit ridiculous how long some scenarios are considering there's no saving, but you can get around that by taking over trains in multiplayer.

These issues make it hard to say whether it's worth buying just yet. It definitely needs more content and polish, but I've personally had my money's worth of playtime already, and it's not overly expensive for what you get (especially compared to Dovetail's offerings). It's also good to support competition in such a niche market.

TL;DR: If you really like train sims and want something new, you'll probably be happy with this."

关于火车模拟品类
火车模拟品类始终是个比较小众硬核的品类，有着一群核心铁杆粉。本作的开发商PlayWay之前开发过不少模拟器游戏，这是第一次接触到火车模拟，这部作品可以说是对于Dovetail Games这样一个会在Train Sim World一部作品里出加起来接近上万块的接近上百个DLC的品类垄断者的革命。

欢迎关注 网易UU鉴赏家培养计划
极速畅玩，联机日友，加速社区，记得来UU哦_(:з」∠)_

火车模拟游戏的受众主要是火车迷、铁路爱好者以及对火车运输和铁路系统感兴趣的玩家。这类游戏通常强调细节和模拟的真实感，因此会有着较高的学习成本。

SimRail的最大卖点之一是其真实的游戏环境。玩家可以选择驾驶火车穿越漫长的真实线路，包括现代欧洲的高速铁路、长途线路，甚至还有上世纪波兰的沙漠铁路，这为玩家提供了各种时代和风格的体验。
游戏的图形质量很高，开车时窗外的草地和树木在风中摇曳，提速时周边风景掠过的感觉非常美妙，动态天气系统带来了积水和积雪，AI乘客也增强了虚拟世界的逼真感，在开车的途中甚至可以下座位去看看那些乘客。
总的来说，从启动到行驶，再到停车，玩家的所有行为都需要严格遵循真实世界的规则和步骤，这是这类游戏最大的乐趣，也是最为繁琐之处。

SimRail具有多人模式，允许来自世界各地的玩家一起游玩。玩家可以选择扮演火车司机或列车调度员，在实时的天气条件下协同合作。联机模式是火车模拟器中前所未有的创新，增加了游戏的社交和合作成分。成为列车调度员需要玩家在车站为列车准备路线，确保按时发车。如果能够找到同样喜欢这类游戏的同伴，相信玩起来应该还是挺有趣的，会产生很多像派队游戏一样有趣的混乱场景。不过可能存在的问题是，打一局的时间可能会有点久。另外对于多人游戏来说，恶意扰乱其他玩家游戏体验等现象如何处理也是值得关注的问题。

最大的问题就是引导不够完全，指示的操作物件有高亮强调，但是非常不明显，而且有时候甚至会没有高亮。而教程中也有流程bug，跳步骤或者回退步骤会导致卡住。整个新手教程的难度很高，手忙脚乱之下大概率会晚点到站，屏幕上方经常出现的扣分提示也会使得新手更加紧张，而且也没有鸣笛教学，但是分数照扣。繁杂的按键和键盘的映射不够直观，操作不够便捷，尤其是旋转型按钮，鼠标控制起来非常麻烦，经常导致开关门失误。各种按钮没有更加详细的说明，适合真正的列车驾驶员来玩这个游戏。"

I honestly just purchased this game as a giant middle finger to DTG. I mean, don't get me wrong - this game shows GREAT potential, and I really hope (and believe) it can get to (and exceed) the point where TSW is currently. That being said, it's still early access and not quite 100% yet, so don't expect perfection and give the devs some time. (Specifically, I'm waiting for single-player dispatcher mode) For now, give the devs your money so they can develop something that isn't DTG payware ♥♥♥♥♥.

Devs: If you are reading this review, I've dumped way too much $$$ into DTG over the years. (Literally hundreds. I have regrets.) I'm happy to dump a ton of money your way instead for a good product that doesn't take advantage of me and offers me good value. So far you guys are on track (pun intended) to deliver an excellent alternative. Respect us, the consumers, and we will make it worth your while."

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Lets get the obvious out the way with first. Obviously simrail is not at the level of TSW in terms of content. From that perspective, the sim won't be ready yet. But even with this localised polish content, there is a lot of stuff that can be taken in, some of which is utterly fascinating.

Locos
+ The loco selection is really good here, you have choices between the express pendolino, early 1970s electric traction, or modern-day freight and passenger units.

+ The level of physical detail is actually pretty impressive here. Particular applause goes to the EU07, which has amazing texture maps. It utilises a mix of real photo-textures and substance-driven materials, which hold up with close scrutiny. It manages to avoid the clinical and plastic feeling of TSW.

+ Systems detail feels really good. I'm not a Polish-traction expert, so I won't pretend to act like I know the degree of accuracy of those systems. However it feels like a sim that prioritises learning the systems over accessibility, which I personally love. Almost every button is functional, including things like radios, fuses. Even washer fluid is simulated in some locomotives.

- Control mapping/Operation/Highlighting could be a bit better here. It's not bad, just really different. Sometimes a bit awkward, that using mouse controls is sometimes easier.



+ Environment here feels like a halfway between TSC and TSW. It feels pretty good and natural, and is an amazing demonstration of what Unity can do.

+ Long routes never feel boring like TSW

+ Specific details inlcude grass density, interior signal-boxes make this game stand out more

+ Lineside detail, tends to be a bit more polished that DTG

- Sometimes the sim can have a ""bleached"" look or a bare look. Some platforms make use of lower quality textures, or materials with no weathering... which contributes to this effect.

- Sometimes I feel like I'm seeing the same vegetation types, and need more variety.



+ Really damn cool! After years of excuses from DTG, Simrail just... did it. Trying both as a dispatcher and driver, it really does add a new dimension to see actual people running a railway. I can't wait to see how this evolves, well done Simrail!

+ Very frequent updates

+ Incoming editor

+ Incoming new regions



You may not want to get stuck in yet, and that's fine. But from what's presented here... I'm actually really excited to see how Simrail evolves in the future!"

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Probably the best train sim I have ever experienced. With the way this is progressing, it could quite easily knock DTG off that top spot. A few bugs here and there but I am sure these will be ironed out throughout EA. The multiplayer mode really is next level. I feel that the singleplayer mode is more of a improve your skills. The real fun is in MP. You can communicate with other players via a radio system (which you can tune yourself) or if you are a dispatcher, make a phone call. Or if voice chat is not your thing, you can use a text chat system instead. Really has catered for all. The only thing missing now is a passenger mode (but I believe I read somewhere that this is coming further down the line). Plus a map editor is also in the works. This train sim is exactly what people have been asking off DTG for YEARS.

The price is 100% worth it. You get four types of train, a massively long route that is about 2 hours end to end I believe. A multiplayer experience, live train dispatching, a 24 hour timetable, a live weather system, and more!! All for £29.50!! Compare this to DTG where for £29.99 you can get the base game which includes three routes which is about 30 minutes to an hour end to end, one or two types of train per route, single player only, and often riddled with bugs and oversights.

If you are debating between SimRail and Train Sim World, I would honestly say with 100% certainty that SimRail will not let you down.

Awesome job SimRail, keep it up!! :D"

For only £/$/€ 30 you get:

500 km of tracks to drive over in 6+ loco's / emu's (plus lots of different coaches and freight wagons), 30+ dispatcher posts to run, with a multiplayer system that brings dispatching and driving trains together in real time, it even has a working train radio system to talk to the dispatchers, just as in real life.

Plus some basic single player stuff that i don't bother with (there are plenty of single player train games out there, SimRail really shines in multiplayer mode)

You get a nice selection of passenger loco hauled and EMU type trains, plus different freight trains to choose to drive over a 24 hour timetable.

No 2 runs will ever be the same due to the human element and the way the Ai works.... and they have not yet turned on the 'random events' feature!

The dev team includes real life train drivers and dispatchers on the Polish railway, and the parent company 'SimKol' makes training simulator rigs for the Polish railways.
So almost everything is represented as it is in real life, the current map is set in 2018 and reflects operating practises at the time.

The 2 main routes are reproduced as they are in real life, so to drive a service from Katowice to Warszawa Wschodnia takes almost 3 and a half hours if you are driving an EP08 loco hauled train with a vMax of 140 km/h, and that's if you get green lights all the way, you will be put into sidings to let higher priority trains pass you,
So if you are driving a slow freight, be prepared to run late and be held in most sidings to let other trains pass, just like in real life.

The graphics are pretty amazing, i play on a Lenovo Legion gaming laptop at 2K resolution (RTX 3070-Ti GFX card) and have all my settings on max except for 'Vegetation Density' i wind that back to 80% because it reveals more content around the tracks that is hidden with it on 100% and gives me an extra 10 fps.

I get an average of 60fps, it does drop to around 30 fps in one or 2 locations, but this only lasts for a few seconds, just remember, this is a train sim and not a fast paced shooter type game, so high FPS rates and low pings are just not required.
Worst that will happen with a high ping is you hear the other players horn as they pass you a few milliseconds later than they did.

Occasional i see a bit of rubber banding of other player trains when passing at high speed, but this in no way breaks anything, and most runs i do not see this at all.

For the original purchase price we have had a few updates, some new loco's added, an extra length of derivable line that is an extra route off the main one, and a few bug fixes,

::::::::::::::::::::

There is something you must understand about SimRail tho, the dev's will not release updates until they are ready for release, so if you are used to another train game where you get 'paid for' updates every few months which are half finished and break existing content, and you actually like that concept, you may not be happy,

The SimRail dev's have been working very hard on a massive update for the last few months, this will give us, amongst other things:

() A completely new EMU (the EN57)
() A core game update (to unity 2023) with updated graphic engine,
() A completely new input system which will allow many more key binds, modifier keys for key binds, multiple bindings of one key for different tasks (walking, driving, dispatching) and the ability to assign functions to joysticks,
() New weather systems and seasons (autumn and winter)
() New signal boxes,
() Drivers timetables based on the real ones used by PKP drivers, viewed in the train on the timetable holder or on screen,
() New loco re-paints / variants,
() Level crossing cameras ..... and so on.

Obviously that is a lot of hard work to implement, but SimRail do not release half finished updates, they were almost ready to release the new input system 2 months ago, but it was discovered at the last minute that it broke some new features they were going to release afterwards.

So they did the correct thing and postponed the input system update.

You will see negative reviews suddenly appearing on steam, this is because a load of impatient people are mad that the latest update was not released in the month they hoped to release it in,
so they think that by leaving negative reviews it will somehow magically make the update ready for release sooner!!

Way i see it, i'd rather wait for the update to be ready for release and as bug free as possible, than get an early update that ruins my SimRail experience.
Just imagine the reviews if that happened.

And don't forget, the cost of the update mentioned above, for this
game is....


It's a free update you are getting for your original purchase price, other train 'game' makers happily charge you the same price as SimRail costs just for an update like that, they call it a 'DLC'"

The only thing I do hope that they are able to improve is the instruction set as giving the keybindings during the tutorial would have made life so much easier, the mouse movement can be a little funky and counter intuitive.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
This game sets out with a noble ambition: to challenge the monopoly on 'mainstream' train simulators that Dovetail Games have snoozed their way into having.

For the record, my favourite train simulators are: Run8, Derail Valley, and Diesel Railcar Simulator. SimRail has elements of all of those and brings them together, to my mind, very well, and more accessibly.

With all that being said, though, it's important to understand that this is early access, and what the game currently does and doesn't have.

What SimRail doesn't have:
Single player. Not really, no. There's not really any AI traffic to speak of in single player mode, it's just a selection of runs along the two sections of route in a variety of trains. I'll explain later why this isn't so big of a deal as you might think.






Expectations sufficiently managed? Here's what SimRail has to offer:






What's it like to play? Setting up the train is fairly involved, but quickly becomes second nature. Actual driving can be done either with the mouse (hover the cursor and you can see what position the power and brake controllers are in) or with the keyboard. Each train takes some getting used to, with the modern ones having a number of different slots on the power controller, that you need to tap up through with Numpad+ and then hold at the top to continuously add power. Likewise, it's a little too easy at first to accidentally hit Numpad- repeatedly to try and get into braking, and instead throw it into the emergency brake. All that said, it doesn't take long before you're cruising along without any problem. You can optionally display reminders of upcoming speed restrictions and signal aspects, with distance counters to each as well as to your next station or waypoint.

Multiplayer is what it's currently all about, and where the signalbox play comes to the fore. Each of the current signalboxes has a telephone for speaking to neighbouring boxes and to train crews, a computer showing that day's scheduled services through your location, and either a computer screen or electronic panel for setting routes. If you're of the right temperment (I am), this is surprisingly compulsive. Clicking to set signals, switches and routes, and watching the trains roll past your window. One box features two level crossing that you control, and you can watch the barriers come down after activating them for an approaching train. After a train passes or departs, you are encouraged to send a message to the receiving signalbox confirm the train number (headcode) and time that it passed so they know what to expect next. There's also a more complex procedure for accepting and sending trains to and from single-track branch lines. I am ex-railway and got to visit a number of different signal boxes in my time, mechanical, power and computerised, and in my opinion, the operations depicted are very realistic and accurate.

The fact that any train, and any signalbox, might be controlled by other players adds a whole layer of interest and unpredictability to the game. What you do has an impact on other players, and that is something only a handful of other non-flight simulators can offer. The internet being the internet, there is the potential for troublemakers, and there have been reports, both during the multiplayer beta test, and now that the full game is live, of people taking over signalboxes and bringing traffic to a standstill. The developers have tried to mitigate this: the more complex boxes can only be operated after you've racked up a certain number of hours on their simpler counterparts, and there are functions to report or mute troublesome players, but the general view of the community is that these don't go far enough yet. For what it's worth, I have yet to encounter any malicious behaviour from other players - only a few instances where another player operating a signalbox was late clearing a signal for me.

It's also worth noting that you can just drive a train in multiplayer and never have to speak to anyone. If you're concerned about the currently thin singleplayer, joining a multiplayer server will let you drive a train for as long or as little as you want, and you'll have plenty of AIs controlling both the signalboxes and other trains that are not being operated by other players. You can get on with what you want to do and for all intents and purposes be left alone.

Overall, I love the game, both what it currently does, and the future potential it holds. My top three are all fairly specialized simulators, with Run8 in particular not being for the faint of heart. SimRail promises to bring more of a comprehensive railway experience to more people, and to with any luck, shake up the genre."

========================================================




The short and skinny of it as a train and train-sim enthusiast.... I'm happy there's a new contender for the genre


Visually SR looks great, some of the best lighting in the genre. Night/Day/Fog/Rain - it looks great. The assets and units themselves look great as well. Things didn't look so much when the first demo came out, the community gave feedback and the devs listened. The general lighting in this is something to behold


Sound-wise its quite top notch as well. The units sound as they should via power/braking/interior etc. The outside ambiance is nice as well with platform chatter and announcements as well as church bells ringing in the distance and crossing arm bells to name a few. The only quirks I've got w/ the base game is some of the horn sounds aren't as clean as they could be.



Playability is enough to keep you going for a while. Commuter, inter-city, regional passenger services as well as freight with a dozen or so single player timetables ranging from 30 mins to 3+ hours for a full run via several hundred miles of operable track. Then there's the multiplayer aspect, which lets be frank not many train sims have... play with pals or rando's operating trains and speaking to one another with PTT/text or run the show as a dispatcher with very in-depth fully integrated tools. Then there's the soon to come editor....


Physics are some of the best IN ANY train simulation barring a few 3rd party products from ye-olde train sim classic or a few niche train sims.
Simple as.


Performance is good for me (of-course with diff machines YMMV)
I've got a 5800x with a 6700xt, 32gb mem loaded on SSD and it runs buttery smooth on max graphical setting with a few hitches here and there but NOTHING like the lack of performance within Train Sim World as an example.
There are plenty of options and settings to get you where you need to be.



I've played the Demo, the MP Play-test and now this EA release and the devs have immensely listened to feedback and updated the game. They seem to actually care about their product and not just cash grab - it's humbling and refreshing as he||



All this being said, this is deemed an 'early access' (what isn't nowadays) so there will be bugs and hiccups but currently imo its a very enjoyable product.
It's currently a Polish only rail network and rolling stock (the devs are Polish..) which may not be 100% my cuppa tea but if this is the canvas on what future content will be displayed upon - we're in luck. They've already mentioned addons possibly in Germany, USA inc. Alaska & Hawaii etc.







I absolutely recommend this

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
If like me, you're not interested in multiplayer, I cannot recommend this game for the time being. Unless you just wanna support the devs, because it's still early access after all.

I spent over three hours completing a single scenario and didn't manage to complete it, because I got stuck on red right before the destination. Trying to radio the dispatcher didn't work on any of the channels. Also at some point, the radio buttons disappeared and I had to click on the empty surface trying to catch them. I was a little behind schedule, and have not seen a single AI train along the way, so I assumed there's no point waiting too long and decided to quit.
The game as of now is very bare bones. In SP, you only have a small choice of pre-made scenarios. The scenarios can be very long, and you have to finish each in a single run, because there is no save option.

There's some good stuff going on, and I have high hopes for this sim's development. The driving feels very good, UI is very transparent and easy to understand. It seems very likely that unlike TSW, this one IS going to get an editor, given that it even has its button in the main menu already. I keep my fingers crossed!

I'll probably change the review after oncoming updates!"

I thought long and hard before buying this as I am not really fond of multiplayer games, but I decided to give it a try and I am really happy that I did.
The single player is really just a place to familiarise yourself with the trains and their controls ATM(although I am sure that will be developed further with time) before you head into multiplayer where the fun starts. You choose a server to join there are about 60 with some dedicated to different languages time zones and skill level etc. You can choose to play as a driver or a dispatcher and if a driver pick a train that floats your boat and join. The train will probably be already on its journey and when you jump in its controlled by a bot. When your happy you can take over and control the train. The route is cut up into sections that can be controlled by either an AI or real dispatcher. Real Life dispatchers have different skill levels which makes life interesting at times but its really great fun and the very fact that things go wrong at times makes it all very fresh and interesting.
The community is very friendly and trains with real drivers will hoot you as you pass them etc. The controls will be quite familiar if you have played other train sims and the loco models are really good with good physics etc. I have not really had any issues with lag but I have been dropped from the sever a couple but if you know the service number of your train you can log back onto the same server and take over from the bot again that will take over the service when you drop. If you need a cup of tea or have a long wait at a red while a dispatcher gets their A game sorted just hit Esc and enable the bot to take over for you while you go have a brew or just sort your life out. You can take over again at any time you want to.
The graphics look really good to me and the route is like a few of the TSW German routes together and driving a freight train from one end to the other can take up a lot of your day with a high possibility of unforeseen stops etc (you just never know what might be up the line waiting for you).
So all in all a fantastic experience and so much potential to become a world beater. I have been playing train sims for over 10 years and I have never been to excited about the future of the genre.
Its a sensible price (just look at the cost of a single DLC now in TSW) and I see it as a great investment in the future of train simulation software"

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
I love this game, This is by far one of the best train simulator games you can get , and its multiplayer, like mp in a train simulator game, its like Christmas but you got what you actually wanted,
The train part.
ive been looking for a train game where the possibility of passing other people driving train. like there are little to no games with that aspect which i absolutely love. and yes you can communicate with vc to other trains and dispatcher (explain all that later down)
a little run down quickly with servers, there are 53 active trains on a server, all are controlled by ai, when a player joins and choosing one of the trains, they take over from the point the ai drove to in its timtable.
when the servers get near capacity you will run into players alot. the route right now is mostly a straight route with a secondary route that branches half way down.

dispatcher part 1. i have a lot of words to say but i dont want to say it. where do i start, oh here line 1. I want to personnally thank the deveolpers of this game. yo guys are great man.
the dispatching in this is amazing 10/10 like wow. i get to set tracks and route for the trains rolling by. and i can talk to them if they are a player. i thought i was dreaming a first. no other train game ive played has this. the best part. ITS ALL MODELED AND YOU GET TO WATCH THE TRAINS DRIVE PAST. like your not fixed on a screen you can legit walk outside and watch the trains drive past. like OMFG why has no one done this sooner, when i jumped on a dispacher location i was stunned i could walk around then dicovered i can go outside, at that point i thought i was dreaming legit pinched myself. i spent a whole day watching trains go past becuse its awsome.

dispacher part 2, now the kid inside has left this is the more serious review for dispatcher. as a dispatcher you job is to make sure
1. trains running through your location are on the right track.
2. will arrive at the right platform for passenger,
3. trains leave on schedule
in depth 3. if you have a train coming through which is 10m early and you have a train which is 5m late but need to cross through the other trains path, its your job to decide if the late train has to wait or set him through making the other train wait.
At first you will be forced to start on a smaller signal box to help you get experince (no dispacher tutorial atm) at first you will get a introduction tutorial when you first join a server as a dispacher but thats it. the larger more difficult station will be locked behind a paytime lock, so the only way to unlock them is by playing more as a dispacher, idk if playtime on trains counts towards this lock.
the computer setup is pretty easy to understand but the manual box with the button table is quite hard to learn to me a few goes with online turtorials to fully understand what does what. (theres alot of buttons to learn ) as it operates totally diffirent to the computer setup. also in the dispacher box (where you are in) theres also a computer screen situated close by that shows the train timtable. which has all the information on where the train is coming from (if you have muiliple lines leaning to diffrent places) where it is heading, what the train number is etc. you will be going back and forwards to make sure the train is going to the right place.
Lastly comunications. VC works as proximity with a 10km range to my reserch. so anyone in that range can hear you talk allowing you to comunicate with trains and trains to communicate with you. atm there are a few station within 10km of each other so if you are part of them you will hear the other dispacherr talking. for the more long range gaps between stations there is a phone to call the next station and you can talk that way.
now all that out of the way. being a dispacher in this game is fun but can be boring some time sif you in one of the less used railine.
other then that if your thinking of getting this game its a 10/10 for me, all i hope to see is more people of the english speaking decide to pickup this game as the dutch and polsih server gets filled quite fast, 76 slots all round. but us english pb are left behind bearly reaching 40 some nights at peak while pol and dutch reach 70 every night"

Finally, a dispatcher simulator that simply WORKS. If there aren't IRL players, the system will move AI trains for you, and it just works.

This is the best rail simulator on the market. For the price, the amount of stock you get and the route length, plus the signalling roles and multiplayer interaction.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
So, having played the Progolue, the Playtests and now the EA release, I can fairly say I can write a proper review.

Long story short: It's good, even with the bugs.

First things first, there are bugs, yes, some still ported from the playtest. But, looking at the big picture and ignoring the bugs, what we have in Simrail is a diamond in the rough.

The MP experience is top notch. People are already making community events where the communication between dispatchers and drivers is key in order to minimise delays. And there have already been situations where some bugs created problems that had to be solved by the players.

The world is beautiful. The amount of trackage in the EA is astonishing (30€ btw), and it all feels incredibly realistic, and unique. The line between Katowice and Warsaw (mostly flat and high speed) feels incredibly different from the line between Katowice and Jedrzeszow (hilly, full of turns and slow speeds).

Physics are very satisfying, but some controls in some trains feel a bit clunky, like there's a delay in your in-game driver's hand between you pressing the button, and the control moving (hopefully improved in the future). However, driving the trains feels very good. A small passenger regional EMU, an old 1980s locomotive pulling an intercity and a freight train all feel different. You need to pay attention to the particularities of each train.

With all that said, there's no easy way of learning some of this stuff. The tutorials put you straight to driving, without even learning the route signals and sign boards. And while most bugs aren't game breaking, some even being minor inconveniences, there are bugs that went away in the playtests and came back during the EA release.

All in all, it has incredible potential, and I can't wait to see what's next in store for Simrail."

It's a nice early access product. You can still find some areas that the team didn't touch, but basic functions are working. The multiplayer is fun, but depends on the others knowing what they are supposed to do. There is a learning curve that is relatively flat when it comes to the driver role. For the dispatcher role it can be a bit more challenging, especially at the beginning."

Stop everything and reconsider what you want in a simulator.
Forget everything else!
If you want ""empty"" features, that are just there but you have no reason at all to use... this is not for you.
If you dont want to be bothered by realism and functionality of knowing what a real train driver has to do... this is not for you.
If you don't want to wait for more features and content to be introduced because this is an early accesss... this is not for you.
If you dont like to co-op play controlling station and chat with a train driver about running conditions or colaborate with the next station's dispatcher... this is not for you.
If you want to sit in your chair and play imediatly with an intuitive app and have no time to waste on a learning curve... this is not for you.

For the rest of you... enjoyment has finally arrived!
Here's a well balanced simulator, promissing a lot, and delivering what others say it's not reasonable."

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
This is the best Train Sim I've ever seen. For around 33 euro, you get around 600km of route and the best online mode in a train simulator I've ever seen. You can play with around 100 others at the same time! You can drive a train or play as a dispatcher in one of the many signal boxes. Not one ride is the same. The dispatcher might diverge you to a siding to let other trains pass. The graphics are amazing.

The developers do not release half broken updates, so it might take a while before an update is released. A new update is coming this November and is divided into two parts.

This sim leaves other conventional sims such as TSW and train simulator classic far behind. In these sims, you usually get a route of +/- 100km and two trains as DLC. For the same price you can buy Simrail.

The game is still early access, but I can't imagine this game won't be released.

If you don't own this game yet, I advice you to buy it immediately."

For me Simrail is a rather basic train simulator. Whilst the dispatch system and multiplayer are certainly a nice feature, the trains themselves feel very superficial and lack any system depth besides the basic driving controls.

Its not like I'm expecting ZUSI levels of realism to the point of SimRail being able to be used for actual driver training, but i would certainly appreciate a bit more details on what irl. has to be done to properly set up your train (for example: entering train and driver data, setting up and testing of train control systems, brake testing, a radio setup consisting of more than pressing the on switch etc.)"

Yes, there are a few bugs and features need to be added, even then it's a must buy.

My advice is to ignore the recent whining children, clearly this sim is being carefully developed over time to make sure it all actually works (something other train sims could learn from!). If you don't want to get into EA then so be it, but for the price of a single TSW route you get something 4+ times longer with a load more rolling stock and a lot more to do. Even if you treat it like a TSW DLC it's amazing value, and it's already growing to be so much more than that."

At this point I really DON'T want to recommend buying it without pointing a few things out. Even for an Early Access Title there is A LOT to be desired, but it still is a fun experience. If you don't mind many of the issues and you crave a decent train sim with a fun multiplayer, then this is for you.

I wanna list the bad, rather than repeat the good:
- Bad Tutorials (give the player an overview of the cab BEFORE you let him push many buttons) and maybe have some for absolute greenhorns with simplified signals and not too many slowzones. Properly explain how handles work! Introduction in cruiste control, hm???
- Performance is somewhat all over the place, it's playable but I experience many stutters and framerate issues while the game doesn't look exactly great
- Why not give the player a control layout overlay to memorize them, instead of having to go to the options again and again?
- Server list is awful. Joining a server and picking a train needs more filters...
- Being thrown off a server every time you finish a route is annoying. Ask me a pick a new train!
- Some of the sounds are crackling sometimes
- Getting very low XP even though you HAD to sit at a red signal for 10 minutes, is somewhat annoyig! Give me XP for patience!
- Smoothness of some animations (getting in or out the train) is not nice
- Apparently in multiplayer passengers don't get on and off your trains
- The signal HUD could use a little reform. See Diesel Railycar simulator as reference (having problems of its own) So at least in this sim you don't have the problem of things being layed on top of each other, but they may appear in a wrong order."

This review was writen when the game was still in ""Early Access"" so keep that in mind if you have nothing better to do than to read my ""review"".

There are few problems with the game right now:

1 - Limited Single Player Content
2 - In Multiplayer you always choose between trains that have already departed from the starting point
3 - DLSS and FSR actually make this game looks better on 1920x1080p 27"" monitor because even with the best Anti-Alliasing available it looks crispy as fu(k
4 - Optimalization is pretty bad not gonna lie, I did not expect that my i5-11600K with 2060S are unable to run this game at max details even with DLSS turned on and barely achieving 40-60fps (depends on locations), on multiplayer I also have random freezes no idea why
5 - I hate Unity...


On the other hand:
1 - ...while I hate Unity the game looks amazing especially the trains, if only optimalization was better
2 - Trains are relatively easy to drive once you figure them out, but they really give you the felling of driving 80+ ton machine
3 - While I have no idea what to say to them, I love the fact that there are dispachers in the multiplayer, it makes the game more alive and realistic as well
4 - Multiple servers with some having slightly different rules or timezones
5 - Very easy to follow tutorial, limited to only three types of trains but still
6 - Does not have thousands of DLCs that make you download the whole game for few days with 1000Mb/s Internet (at least not yet)

I really love the game right now, it allows me to properly relax compared to PvP FPS games, I can't wait when they add new regions, countries and timelines although I guess for those I'm gonna wait a bit but well it's Early Access after all."

I saw some videos about this game and thought I would give it a try. Unfortunately, this game lacks quite a bit. The actual driving itself was rather shallow. Nothing very complex and intricate. There is also a clear lack of information for the player (especially those who are not familiar with the Polish rules and regulations). There was no explanation of any of the signage and no indication of what they mean, even in the tutorials. I would love to be able to play the multiplayer as a dispatcher, but since it's locked behind a tutorial (and I spent 2 hours trying to complete, to no avail) I wasn't able to enjoy that aspect. I'm going to keep an eye on this game and might get it again once they update it, but for now my review will stand."

If you like simulators where (almost) every button works as it should, this game should be on your shortlist. There's some excellent soundwork and I'm happy to see some really good lighting (especially compared to the competition)
Could graphics be better? Absolutely, this game is not going to win any awards compared to modern FPS, but in the train simulator genre this is definitely a step forward.

It's definitely early access though, as there's not too much content yet and a lot of room for optimization. But this is a good foundation, along with multiplayer and dispatcher gameplay. If the devs keep at it and hopefully add more tracks (maybe even other countries such as Switzerland, Germany, Austria, etc?) this could turn out to become a real gem. No VR support yet, unfortunately.

Right now, this is a buy if you're really into trains, and a wait for later if not or you're expecting a game with a ton of content ready for use."

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Let me start off with: ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!

Really, I'm highly satisfied with this. After playing the demo, I wasn't really sure about it. But after playing the playtests with multiplayer? It has become one of my favourite train simulation games! Do I recommend it to my friends and even Social Media followers? YES!! And here's why:

The playtests gave me an idea of what to expect. And boy oh boy, did I look forward to drive the Polish Pendolino that we were getting teased during that time! Of course, Pendolino was the very first train I drove in multiplayer as soon as the Early Access release was here.

Seriously, I'm very picky when it comes to train simulation games. And no doubt I've been having a great time playing this game. Meeting friends in-game, sometimes by surprise while driving a train?! You have no idea how awesome that feels. Or maybe you do! I do everything from flashing the loco lights, turning ON and OFF the cab lights, honking the horns, all things to just greet people on the way. I wish there was a way to make our avatars to wave at each other. In fact, people have seen to find a way to greet each other such as jumping repeatedly. :D No doubt, an absolutely fantastic experience. Have you even noticed that sometimes you can even hear train station announcements?! And they're not even random, they ARE announcing information about the exact trains. Even most station passenger information boards work ( there's still some bugs here and there on that regard ). What about overtaking a friend's train because his train was slower than my Pendolino?! Epic.

Sure, single player still needs improvements. I've already read that the devs are planning on introducing a save game feature which is definitely needed for single player mode. But honestly, with an epic gameplay we get on Multiplayer? I don't really care about single player here so much. It was something I was missing on my favourite train simulation games anyway.

Trains variety: For a release, I think this is pretty good. Some people complain that there isn't too much variety. I disagree - we've got the classic EP07 / EU07, Traxx MS2, Pesa EMUs, Newag Dragon and Polish Pendolino. And of course a rather good variety of rolling stock to pull with the locomotives.

Bugs: there's definitely some bugs, but knowing how the devs are keen to listen to feedback and keep on improving the game ( they even worked on Christmas 2022 and put out updates for us during that time!! ), I'm sure most bugs will be fixed in the meantime.

My personal wishes for this game, besides the avatar waiving gesture, are as follows:

- route expansion DLCs ( I do look forward to drive down to Kraków or even to Bohumín! )
- more locomotives ( Vectron please! But to keep that classic Polish train tradition, I think the game needs EN57s and at least an EP09 to drive with the EC trains faster )
- possibility to see your whole train schedule
- possibility to know your train weight and length information
- possibility to spawn in MP sessions as a guest to just roam around the map freely
- possibility to board trains as passengers... maybe also some sort of conductor feature at some point?
- preview of information in regards to server restarts ( although currently this has been improved, it is still unclear when are the servers due to restart and it is a bit annoying that you can't really continue the journey you were doing before )
- slightly more random train timetables
- introduction of ETCS ( and other safety systems as required )
- introduction of actually loaded freight into the wagons

And besides these wishes, the only thing I can look forward to is the SDK and mod support. I'm sure the community will find ways to improve and add content into the game. I also wish you could consider on allowing people to create their own servers and eventually also allow servers with custom-built routes / modded routes.

THANK YOU DEVS for your hard work. What a fantastic game so far. I really want to see SimRail grow and improve. Keep it up!

PS: And now off I go to bed, after my first complete journey from Warsaw to Katowice with an EC hauled by an EP07. Started at around midnight my time. It is currently almost 5 am. :D It took long but man, it was FUN!!!"

MOVE OVER DOVETAIL GAMES!!! THIS IS A GAMECHANGER!!!

So the basics, this game is in early access and the devs only plan to be there for 3-6 months, theres 2 routes and 4 trains, the trains are modelled very well with mostly all of the buttons and switches being interactive and clickable, its been in development for quite a while now so the product is quite refined and just needs a couple of bugfixes which the dev patched a couple of hours after release, includes a route editor which is unavailable at the moment but it looks promising!as for the graphics i use a gtx1070 and run it comfortable at high settings on 1080p, and even at those settings the graphics look fine, runs at 60fps too with no issues, tried running on ultra but with the outdated GPU it was still pushing around 40fps so not bad and the game definaterly looked great!
No gamepad or controller support yet but this is planned for the future!
Also the multiplayer is split up into different servers so you have your noob servers and your ""pro"" servers which is a fantastic idea! ive not actually played multiplayer yet but i still think its a fantastic addition for noobs to practise before going on the pro servers!
Ive not played as a dispatcher either so cant comment on that.
The key thing between this and TSW series is DTG spend their time on fancy sky textures whereas this dev have clearly though about evrything, even doen to the fact you constantly have to monitor your progress as theres a point system so if you pass that sign without sounding a warning horn your getting 10 points took off!! also the whole game runs on a real time based timetable which is pretty cool.
Now its not perfect, there are a couple of bugs but the devs seem to be hot on it and squash them straight away!
I paid £26 for this and its got extremely high potential, is it worth the price in its current state? im going to say no as the content is lacking however when it comes out of early access and the price goes up to £50 youre gonna wish you bought it in Early access!
So overall ratings are:
7/10 for graphics (I imagine it looks fantastic in 4k but for my rig i cant see that)
5/10 for content (only 2 routes and 4 locos but the route lentgh is insane, nearly 500km)
9/10 for gameplay (literally everything in the cab is simulated)"

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
SimRail is arguably one of the most detailed and complex railroad simulators currently on the market.

In singleplayer, the game has a lot less to offer, but it's still an interesting package. You only have a handful of routes and trains to pick from, all from Poland, which has led to a number of negative reviews. However, the UI design seems to suggest there's plans to expand on this, which I certainly hope is true, however, even if not, there's still a lot to offer. The routes are quite long, with some routes having expecting you to take around three hours to complete (the shortest, non-tutorial route I saw was about an hour). There are both freight and passenger routes, however, I have not tried the freight routes.

In multiplayer is where the game really shines though. Although still operating with the limited number of trains and routes, there are now other players and AI-controlled trains populating the world. Additionally, the multiplayer features one of my favorite and possibly the most unique features in this game, dispatchers. As far as I'm aware, there are no other games of this quality featuring dispatchers. In singleplayer, this is just an AI you talk to (similar to Microsoft Flight Simulator), but in multiplayer this can be a real person, which you can communicate with through either text chat or voice chat. Additionally, you can play as a dispatcher routing trains through your region. There are three main types of control systems for dispatchers. The most modern uses a computer to route trains, only requiring you to select the designating route. Older systems feature electric lights and switches, but require a little more work to route trains. (This feature isn't yet implemented, but I suspect it is in the works since they have screenshots of this type of system). This is something I don't believe is present anywhere else, and I absolutely love it. Multiplayer is pretty accessible since all interactions can be performed using either text or voice, and the design makes it so even these interactions *could* be avoided mostly. If you are unwilling or unable to play multiplayer, however, I honestly am not sure this is going to be the right game for you.

Being an early access game, there are also other quirks that can be annoying. Many more advanced features are not explained to you, and while most of the important commands and UI have been converted to English, there are still some Polish labels, especially for unfinished or rarely used components. These issues are easy to fix, and that's most likely why the game is in early access. If this will annoy you, you may want to wait a while before purchasing.

This is still an early access game, and it can feel a little lacking (especially in singleplayer) compared to other simulators, but the detail and complexity, as well as the unique features of this simulator, more than make up for its shortcomings. I would definitely recommend it."

Fantastic game. Look forward to seeing new features come later on. However some of the things I feel need improved:

Sound of rushing air in tunnels/passing trains

More ai traffic as the routes feel abandoned

I was a little skeptical after playing the prologue, but I would by lying if I didn't say I was still excited that these developers would be able to deliver. And yet, they completely did. This has very rapidly become my favorite rail simulator of all time, beating out the graphics of ""TSW"", and coming very close to beating the physics of Run8 - though, not QUITE yet (no ability to rip your train apart from acceleration/braking), though it DOES have both the ability to derail, and to experience wheel-slip. On top of all of that, the dispatch experience in multiplayer (I know, I know... I'm not particularly a fan of MP games myself) is honestly one of the most fun things I've got to binge on in a long time. The community is pretty awesome as well, and takes it (mostly) seriously, lol! Not only did this sim meet, but absolutely exceeded my expectations - and it's still only in Early Access! Honest opinion? It's a solid 8 or 9 out of 10. Buy it."

This is utterly stunning!

Absolutely deserving of the high reviews and I'm over the moon it's as good as I hoped it would be! This feels like the next generation of train sim. The physics and sound are gorgeous, and it's super easy to pick up as the tutorials (at least in my experience) are great - the buttons you need to press are all highlighted and the dialogue is friendly, upbeat and informative. Everything in the cab feels so satisfying to use - adjusting the combined power / brake handle in the Elf with the keys felt a little unusual at first, but after a couple of runs, I'm utterly in love with it. Being able to quickly dial the acceleration down to zero with two quick taps and just tapping once to slowly reduce it down to whatever setting you want is lovely! I also really enjoy watching the platform activity - passengers board the train and physically make their way through the carriage to a vacant seat and sit down. They feel less robotic than any other train simulator out there - they just seem more believable. And that makes a difference.

The sim runs beautifully even on a humble machine, and graphically it's lovely even on the lowest settings. It's sturdy and clearly built on great foundations with a huge amount of care, dedication and love. I haven't run into a single crash at all. I think you can really appreciate the passion fuelling this sim - it feels like the people that made it adore trains, and it really is a love letter to a global train simulation community that has been left wanting since the golden days of Microsoft Train Simulator. This feels like the true successor to that game, and providing the process of producing new routes, locomotives and sounds is straight forward, it'll absolutely dominate the market at this rate.

Obviously being early access there are areas the game needs to grow and flesh out, many of which have already been touched on in other reviews. I think for me, something akin to a Quick Drive would be excellent. Just a basic feature allowing you to select the train, the consist, the route, the start and end point plus the stations you want to stop at in-between. Being able to choose your weather (dynamic or a set preference) and the ability to pick the start time would be ideal too. I think an innovation here would be to add some kind of randomness to the signalling in this mode so it keeps you a little more on your toes.

But yeah, I'm extremely happy with it, I can't wait to jump back in! A huge well done guys - keep smashing it, the competition will really struggle to compete if you keep this momentum up. I can't wait for the editor and thank you so much for introducing us to your wonderful railways and trains! You should all be incredibly proud of what you have achieved!"

[Early Access version]
Content-wise you play on (currently) 2 routes in Poland between Kattowice and Warzawa / Sedzizow. In short: the tracks are astonishing real!

Ohhh - this turned out to be visual attractive, with loads of love for details and fun to play. On top - it works excellent with proton in linux. I now have 66 hour play time without booting up Win11 a single time!
Even if Single player mission editor is not released yet, inspecting the files already show so many options I can't wait to make use of, like weather setting (you must try the thunderstorm setting!), car type, load, brake mode, weight, travel path etc.
In Multiplayer it is already open for a certain degree of mods - so you can see the map of the server with all the players - where they are and what they drive. Also - you can pick the role as dispatcher and route trains from a dozend more or less complex signal boxes of various types.

If you enjoy Run8 for US railroads, SimRail is similar for European Railroads. Currently minus industry but the scenery already offers massive tracks in industrial areas, switching yards and intermodal yards. Big difference: while in Run8 operation is self organized once industries are set up, in SimRail all traffic goes along timetables.

For me it turned out to be a bit addictive, something that Railroads Online, TS, TSW not managed to do. I will spend a few more hours with this game!"

Hi :)
A very interesting and promising simulator. Most commercial simulators available on the market have very simplified control models. In SimRail, we get high realism of driving and the operation of devices and rolling stock. From the very beginning, the creators care about users, are in constant contact with them and respond to bug reports or suggestions for improvements. The simulator has frequent updates and fixes. It is worth noting that at the product development stage, you could use several free versions: demo, prologue or playtests to familiarize yourself with the simulator and decide whether to buy the game in the early access version. A worthy successor to the free ""Maszyna"" or ""TD2"" simulators, which until now were the only such extensive simulators focusing on Polish routes and rolling stock. I hope that SimRail will only get better with time :) It has the potential to become the best railway simulator :) I cordially greet the creators, keep my fingers crossed and wish you all the best.

Got the game on day 1 and can tell this wasn't a mistake. Long routes, fantastic detail for the loco's, and other rolling stock, a bit complicated, but once got used to, a very interesting signalling system (plenty of guides to help you through) and an online multiplayer where not only driving is available! Yes indeed train dispatching at the stations is a thing and that makes online a very dynamic gameplay to play with. This mode shows how important is to keep a busy timetable smooth and steady. I know that from my IRL train driving experience. One mistake, one unnecessary hold up or even a driver error can cause multiple train delays which not only is frustrating sometimes but it makes more life like. Recent update brought this game to another level by bringing new rolling stock, quite large graphical improvements, seasons and much more to come and it's a perfect example that it is possible without releasing a new title with ""very dramatic few minute pre-release videos"" where new raindrops on the windshield is introduced (throwing rocks to Dovetails TSW series).
In summary, game already looks great. Physics of the trains feels great, sounds has many details innit. Thumbs up from me best of luck for the developers in their hard work to make this game shine in the railway games department."

Writing it in the early access phase, but this is already a proper and realistic train simulator with mindblowing graphics and realistic physics. There isn't much content (as of now) but i'm sure more stuff and features will be added later and you can drive an endless amount of trains in multiplayer. And well multiplayer is the real fun. Dispatchers talking to you, drivers talking to dispatchers, horn and light battles with oncoming trains, heavy traffic, and many routes and trains to choose from. Real railroad feeling
As it's still early access, you might encounter bugs and performance drops, but usually nothing serious

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
If this review could recommend ""neutral"" or ""potentially wait and see"", I'd have chosen that option.

The simulation itself has clearly been created with love. The single route currently available (indicated as two separate routes in single player, but combined as one in MP) is detailed and lengthy (hundreds of route miles of track). Similarly, while only five types of locomotive/MU are available, each is a fully detailed recreation - ranging from modern EMUs with ""press forwards to go"" controls, to the EU07's 1960s-style control scheme with its incredibly atmospheric mechanical clunking and clattering of relays behind the cab as you notch up. The signalling and dispatcher controls also show a very rarely seen level of attention to detail - down to having to break the seals on mechanical releases if you mess things up.

The multiplayer is relatively well designed, and reasonably stable - other than logging in and not moving/dispatching trains, it seems resilient to most forms of intentional harm. Passing a signal at danger will reset your train (rather than messing up gameplay for others); the server will prevent the most harmful misroutings by player dispatchers; and the AI is (generally) capable of filling any role not covered by a player. This is in contrast to some competing games, where client-server desyncs were very common and harmful, and where the simulation would feel very empty if players weren't around.

Where the game currently lacks somewhat is in content. In singleplayer, only a small handful of scenarios are available, with no free-roam, ""choose a train from the timetable"", or ability to use the editor. Multiplayer is, unusually, more fully-fledged, with players able to pick any train on the timetable. For drivers, the number of servers is generally sufficient, although some language communities have quickly filled up the couple of servers available to them, and players have no ability to host their own sessions.

The well-simulated dispatcher mode is, sadly, very limited. It is available in multiplayer only, with only a small number of locations available to players (13 per server, with 27 servers offering dispatcher mode, reduced to between 1 and 7 servers if you wish to play in your own language). The majority of dispatcher positions are also very simple, with no stations, junction, or activity other than a handful of passing trains per hour, leading to even worse competition for the few interesting spots. This is then worsened by an in-built time-gating system, preventing new players from accessing most non-trivial locations until they have *hours* of playtime in dispatcher mode. This has led to repeated issues with new players simply logging in to a boring location and leaving their computer, stopping play for others - even if kicked after 30 minutes, it counts towards their hours.

The initial release has a number of bugs on its opening weekend - ranging from tooltips going missing and controls not being quite right, to the server AI occasionally managing to get itself into a complete mess needing a restart. Hopefully these will be patched quickly - devs have at least been responsive in acknowledging reports on the forum, and a couple of game-breaking bugs in singleplayer scenarios were attended to quickly. Game performance is also somewhat of an issue, particularly frame drops when new models are loaded in, though perseverance with settings can at least give consistent (if not amazing) performance."

Driving a diverse set of rolling stock. Dispatching at station signalposts along the mainline. A full mainline from Katowice to Warsaw... Plus a secondary line and multiple connections between them. A proper, deep simulation for the vehicles and the dispatching. And a fluid, well-functioning multiplayer environment that requires collaboration.

This simulator is the new dominating force in train simulation. With US and German routes already in development by outside studios, there's going to be expansion beyond Poland. As well as the functionality still being added through the early access program, which includes seasons, random events/disruptions along the line, AI improvements which will further allow in-route turnarounds as well as further expansion to timetables; and a secondary route set in the 1980s in which you'll take control of steam locomotives.

SimRail has been baking for a long time. And the release has been an absolutely astounding example of how to do things right. Open communication, an engaging team, and a continued showing of dedication to improving SimRail as a platform has provided an expanding, immersive experience that I can't honestly find an equal to.

And they don't try to rate you or force medals of skill on you like some others. However you can 'level up' in a way that generally shows progress, much like the Truck Simulators. It's nice."

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
I thought driving a train would be a chill, relaxing experience. Well, let me tell you, the routes currently available are very hectic and engaging. Aside from the vigilance system making sure you are awake, there are so many things to pay attention to. Are you going the speed limit? Are you behind schedule? What side of the train is the platform so you can open the correct doors? Are you moving into a different radio zone and have to change the channel on your radio? Is there a crossing ahead so you have to sound your horn? Is the track damaged ahead meaning you have to drive on the left track? Well don't forget to change your lights to the right mode! Windshield is dirty and it's getting hard to see? Where was that switch for the wipers and windshield washer again?

There's so much to do, and most of the buttons, levers, knobs and switches of the various trains are able to be interacted with. The displays all show realistic data. Oh, and did I mention that everything is realistically modelled with INCREDIBLE attention to detail?

That's before you even get into the multiplayer modes where you share the routes with other players who, by the way, can also take over the station switches and control the routing.

Overall, this is just an amazing simulator. If you like trains at all, I highly recommend picking this one up."

Really good train simulator! I've played 'Maszyna' for some time. But the controls were not easy to understand. Now here is a well-developed Polish train simulator. Train physics is superb. Also, the sounds of the carriages and locomotives seem authentic. Unity graphics have a peculiar color tone, but it's beautiful. But I have some suggestions, like: 1. the ability to see signals from a distance; some enhancements are needed for the signal lamps. 2. Interactive driver/passenger cabin cameras and trackside cameras are needed. Now it's all static. Some speed limits are wrong. In one instance, 40 KPH was shown, but when entering the limit zone, it shows 20 KPH and overspeed. The brakes seem to be overpowered for a train!

I have to say that the game runs definitely better then the prologue on my system. The price for this game is totally worth it, if we compare it with a route DLC from TSW.
if you are undecided to buy it or not, like I was, think that you have a very long route to drive which can count up to 5 or 6 TSW's route DLCs plus you get a dispatcher gameplay mode and a multiplayer feature together with 3 loco types to drive.
I am sure this game will not replace TSW in your favorites especially if you are not into multiplayer or dispatcher gameplay, but it has a certain feel to it which makes it very appealing."

Refunded it at first as was worried about multiplayer and single player seemed a bit sparse. Was encouraged by other's comments and was reassured. The whole thing has a very pleasurable feel. The landscape seems a lot more expansive, and It feels more like driving and riding a train than in other sims of the DTG type. I trust a lot more will be added until final release which i hope will include some kind of saves. Definitely worth the money for what it has now. The older locos are joy to behold and drive. I even like the modern ones which I would not normally bother with in other sims. You do have to concentrate on your driving and remain engaged in the task.

The best train sim out right now. Multiplayer is a blessing and the graphics are amazing, performance is exceptional. Yes theres some bugs but they are being ironed out. The route is extensive. ALthough some factors of the game and gameplay are a little limited its well worth the hundreds of hours that you'll spend playing Simrail."

Not just a brilliant concept, but also simply an amazing game all around. The lovely artstyle and the playful soundtrack perfectly fit together, but the game can also be brutal and hard. It is a completely different game depending on who you play with and against. Every level has it's own soundtrack with two different versions for each phase, and every single of those tracks is so catchy and awesome, but even though the tracks are very different because they are supposed to fit the level they are playing in, they still have a consistent style. And each level brings a unique twist to the game too.

This game is pure slapstick and even though I played it so much already, I still can't stop laughing when I play this with friends. I wish I had this game when I was a child, this is exactly the kind of game you can get addicted to as a child (in a good way) and grow up with and have fond memories. If you have children, this game is bloody perfect too. It channels creativity, is family friendly and can be played in a variety of ways. Honestly I would even go as far as giving this game a 10/10 rating, and I say this as someone who owns over 430 games on Steam.

Big thank you to the developers for delivering this unique, brilliant and fun as hell experience."

This game is really fun if you like platformer games or any of the first 8 or so Mario Party games. It's a really fun game to play, especially when you have 4 players where things get hectic. That said, if you want a quick laugh, read below:

Pros:
+ True party game
+ Very fun
+ Handicap system
+ Local and Online multiplayer (can be both)
+ Silly characters
+ Dance taunting with sound effects
+ Free-for-all clown fiesta
+ Hilariously trollish
+ Tons of traps to kill your friends with
+ Black Hole projectile physics
+ Honey can combine traps
+ Can enjoy your friends' tears

Cons:
- Challenging
- Maps can be made impossible
- Rage inducing
- Bigger friendship killer than Monopoly

11/10 Would kill my friend with 4 different traps at once again."

A super fun game to play with your kid/s. I showed this game to my 4 year old son and he loved it. We played it together for about a year almost every day. That was my first father/son multiplayer bonding experience. First we tried unlocking all the levels, then user-generated challenges and eventually started to create cool levels of our own!

One thing that could be improved: when two players get separated through the map it gets zoomed out a lot and it is hard to control your character. It would be preferable that the screen would split in that situation. Other than that - very fun and quirky game for all ages."

Honestly one of the best Party Games ever made. The concept of building an obstical corse that's too hard for your friends, but still doable by you, is really really entertaining. And because you're building something new every time you play, it adds a massive amount of replayablity to the game.
If you're looking for something to play with friends, get this."

PROS:
+ Very funny/enjoyable
+ No bugs (I haven't encountered any)
+ Moving and jumping ""feels"" good
+ Can create a lot of fun memories with your friends
+ Local multiplayer
+ Trap layouts and ways to solve them are almost always unique and different (see cons section)
+ Soundtrack is great
I can't really find any cons with this game, but here are some that I thought of...
CONS;
- Doesn't feel the same when playing with random people
~ get kind of repetitive depending on what you do (i.e playing the same trap layout over and over again) when playing

All in all, Ultimate Chicken Horse is a very fun party game to play with friends and family, but (for me) loses its charm when playing online with people you don't know. It's always funny to hear various screams, profanities, and laughter from the floor below when playing with my siblings."

""What is 'Ultimate Chicken Horse'?"", you ask. I ask you ""WHY AREN'T YOU PLAYING IT?!?""

There's tons of reviews and such on this game, but the basics are this:

Grab friends, pick an animal you wanna play as and then pick a stage. Stages are broken into rounds where you each first grab a device, mechanism or block that is offered, then place it someplace on the stage. Some are helpful, some are traps. Then play swaps to where you all run the obstacle course you've just built in a race to the finish line. Next round, repeat and build onto the previous. Then keep going until an 'Ultimate' Animal is awarded. There's tons of unlockables and the devs have been s upporting the game non-stop since the game was 1st introduced. To this day, they're still adding new stuff!

This is an ULTIMATE party game!"

Ultimate Chicken Horse is a multiplayer, platformer game based at ""Go from A to B and make the road harder/easier""


Singleplayer There is no singleplayer, you need to play with a friend (in your house)


Multiplayer Even though multiplayer is still in open beta, you can have a lot of fun with your friends and even random players!


Discovered problems
* Sometimes you can't connect to public server
* One time i coulnd't see my friend's character (And server didn't count him as a winner even when he won)
* Once i didn't see objects in ""Party box""
* Little lags
* Also when i want to move my selected object my mouse freeze
* I don't know if it is a bug, but you can get achievements for something what your friends do for example: Your friend place a crossbow, crossbow kills someone and you can get an achievement for killing someone with arrow






Is not bad, is very friendly and funny


I don't like keyboard for that types of games, so i really appreciate that


You can invite full team of your friends and play with them! so cool :3


Multiplayer is very nice! Community is amazing too!


Achievements are interesting, but bugged a bit






Bugs are very annoying i hope it will be fixed

One of the only games I will never see myself abandoning, I've spent alot of time on Ultimate Chicken Horse and for years I've always thought it to be the best game on Steam (I know, I'm a simple person). I spend most of the time playing Party online, (I like to put new players into difficult situations, in hopes they learn faster? Sorry not sorry.) but I also do create maps, not as often but I try, (by the way, I have a map on page 1 of Top Rated all time(That's a plug)).

I fell in love with this game's concept (and presentation) when I first saw it being played by the Giant Bomb crew. After months of impatiently waiting for the release, my friends and I had to wait a bit more before the online functionality was available. Today it came, and even though there were bugs, the gameplay shone through and proved to be just as fun as I expected.

This is a great game to play with your friends. 2 players is fun but it gets exponentially better with more. The best part? Your movement is client-side, meaning you can comfortably play this with people across the world.

The gameplay is the real selling point, but the presentation deserves special mention as well. The art style fits the hilarious quirky gameplay very well, and is well animated. The sound effects are a perfect compliment to the visuals, from the UI to the sound of your character's head bumping a ceiling. And the sheep makes adorable noises!

Aside from the bugs which the developers are working hard to eradicate, this is a great example of how to make a fun online party game. Don't give this a second thought if you're looking for a good time full of laughs with friends.

Update: Aforementioned bugs were eliminated long ago, this game is polished and there is more free content on the way."

I can't articulate how much I love this game. It's so unlike anything else I've ever played. Just buy this game. Don't even think about it. Online is steadily being improved. And for the couch it's a blast.

It's like a competiive Mario Maker where you take turns screwing each other.

The amount of complexity that can be made is actually astonishing. Parts can interact in ways you wouldn't expect, adding virtually infinite replay value to the game. Plus it's damn charming with adorable animals dying horrific deaths.

I've played 10 hours and have nothing but good things to say about it. The controls take a little getting used to and a controller is probably best, but i've gotten really good on a keyboard with practice."

Everything from the level design to the physics are all absolutely fantastic. I am surprised by how great the game and the community content is. It indeed is amazing.

Ultimate Chicken Horse is the perfect game for those who love to party and punish their friends. This game will have you laughing so hard that you might even forget you're playing a game. You'll start by selecting your favorite animal, and then it's time to get creative with building the ultimate obstacle course.

As you lay down traps and platforms, you'll find yourself giggling like a schoolgirl as you imagine your friends falling into your devious traps. But be careful not to fall into your own traps, or you'll look like a total chicken.

The best part of Ultimate Chicken Horse is watching your friends struggle to navigate your insane course. It's almost as fun as watching a group of toddlers trying to figure out how to share their toys. Plus, the victory dance at the end is priceless.

Overall, Ultimate Chicken Horse is a game that will leave you in stitches. It's perfect for parties, family gatherings, and any occasion where you want to humiliate your loved ones in a fun and playful way. So, grab some friends, a few drinks, and get ready to laugh until you cry!"

One of the greatest couch multiplayer games in a long time. Pretty fun online too. There is so much replayability in the fact that you are actively making your own levels within the levels. Worth $15, but I caught it in a Humble Bundle."

Ultimate Chicken Horse is a really fun multiplayer game with some bugs and online issues.

Ultimate Chicken Horse (UCH) is a Level Designer-like Platformer. When you're in a level with other people, you can add platforms and traps each round. When everyone's done placing their objects, you then play the level. Your job is to be the only person to get to the goal, and prevent the other players to also succeed. If everyone makes it to the end, nobody gets points for that round (unless someone got an object called a Coin.). If everyone dies, nobody gets points for that round.

The controls when the level you're in takes some time to get use to. To me, they were really floaty the first time I played the game, which caused some accidental fails (like accidentally falling through a small gap). While they do need to get use to, the control layout is simple and easy to learn. I played this game with my Ps3 controller (I did some thing that makes my computer think my Ps3 controller is a Xbox 360 controller.), and the controls never got confusing, but since they're floaty in this game, again, they need to get use to.

When in the Build-like Mode, you can place 1 object every round (but I think you can change the amount of objects you can place down in the rules). In Party Mode, you and the other players get 4-5 random objects to choose from every round. If you see an object you want, you need to be quick, since the other players can take that object away from you. In Freeplay Mode, you get to select 1 object of your choice every round. If you want to place down a trap? You can do that if you want! Want to delete an object someone placed? You can do that if you want!

If you're the host, you can change the rules for your game. You can increase rounds, change the Game Mode, etc. So if you want your game to be different or more interesting, you can try to do that.

At the start of the game, you only get 3 levels, 4 characters, and no outfits. In order to get more levels/characters/outfits, you need to find these boxes with a ""?"" on them in the levels you have. If there is a box, a ? appears on a level in the Lobby. In order to get the boxes, you just need to touch them or put a trap next to them. It's easier than it sounds.

The Soundtrack and Artstyle are really good. Can't say anything else.

There are problems with the game: Bugs and Online Issues.

-When I was playing with other people I don't know, one of them said that they couldn't select an object, even though he was pressing the left mouse button on the object he wanted. Because of this issue, he/she couldn't put any objects down, only the the two players and I.
-I put stairs on a rotating object that had honey on it. At first, the stairs rotated like I wanted to, but then the stairs stopped rotating and was at a different place the next round.

I've encountered more bugs, but those are the bugs I can think of right now.

-When playing Online, things are out of sync at times. Like for example: I jump into a saw that's rotating, and I fail. The next player jumps, and even though it looks like he/she touched the saw, he/she is still going. Or like an arrow hits a player, and he/she's still going.
-Some things do disappear from a player's view. Sometimes an object disappears on a player's screen, which might screw them over.

Overall, if you want a really fun party game, Ultimate Chicken Horse is for you! Don't want to get 4 copies of the game? No worries! You can hook up 4 controllers to your computer and play the game together, just like that. In my opinion, 15 dollars is worth it for the super fun gameplay that never gets old.

Highly Recommended!"

Nominated for the ""The Even Better Than I Expected"" Award:

When I first saw this game I thought it was a bit silly and ridiculous just from the title alone. The simple graphics and cartoonish nature of the game was different everything I've seen from the recent years, but after watching the store page video I thought it looked pretty fun.

The game is a simple platformer with the purpose of getting from Point A to Point B. The craziness really shines when you play with three or four friends as everyone plays a part in forging the empty space into a gauntlet of terror. Everyone will be able to place an object, either trap or platform, to craft a unique level every time. There'll be a lot of laughs as you start to make impossible routes while questioning your friendship, but half the fun is thinking outside the box by getting around it all, or basking in the glory when one of you actually make it through."

Okay! Time to eat my own foot. It's also a city builder now, but not quite.

Yes. This is a puzzle game. Not quite a city builder like everyone else has claimed, but the Creative Mode update has changed that, and I think that is an interesting thing to look into, hence the update. This is no Sims and it sure as hell doesn't need to be. For a small group of german game design students, this game definitely shows their skill at game design. It's exactly as advertized. Relaxing, fun and surprisingly challenging. I still haven't gotten to 10,000 points bare minimum yet, and there are people who have hit 24K, which is impressive in its own right.


Yeah... This game is uh... It's addicting. DAMNED addicting. Like, you actually lose your sense of time while playing it which is impressive, and I have unfortunately caught myself dreaming of detailed hexagons thanks to the game because I'm clearly in need of another clinical cure to my sanity. I'll let that, again, be its own indictment of how good this game is. It's a fun game, but I definitely recommend short play times with a maximum of two-hour intervals so you don't burn yourself out or end up playing until the dawn has come to burn your vampiric, ghost-white flesh from your sorry bones.


Answer: The pieces.

You have puzzle pieces with six sides that can have all sorts of items placed on them. The side types are as follows:

Plains
Wheat Field
Household
River/Ocean
Railroad

You basically put the pieces together while fulfilling challenges to keep the fun going. The further you get, the higher your score and the more of a colossal bird's-eye continent you have that you can just examine at your leisure. This game DOES NOT rush you. You can take as long as you like to place a single piece. You also get bonus points for matching the pieces together like you building the continent of Mata Nui from the Bionicle board game (Look it up).


Well, the Creative Update fully released, and as such I only thought it would be fair to update my review to reflect that and clean up errors people had brought up in my review to reflect that. Creative Mode adds a lot of new ♥♥♥♥ to the game that makes it more fun for people wanting a more free-form experience. Again, it's not QUITE a city-builder, but Creative Mode lets you play around with the game's tile generation settings to get more results that you'd like for use in making an endlessly large map. I spent about an hour playing around with it and had some fun. For once, I finally got to make an ocean, so that foot in my mouth is tasting at least something like a toes-and-philly-steak sandwich. I got a real out of the little boost of playtime the new mode provided to say nothing else more concise.


So... This game is currently a piddly little 396 megabytes in size. Yeah, it's about half the size of Diablo II. Which is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ impressive. Being fair, it's not exactly consuming any real resources so the size is to be expected. The music is a recent addition, and it helps with the relaxation. The colors are bright, but don't assault your eyes. In short, it's a joy to play,


Gameplay: 8/10
Music: 6/10 (Relaxing, but not outstanding/doesn't need to be)
Graphical Fidelity: 6/10

OVERALL RATING: 7/10

In short, it's a very fun, relaxing game. IT doesn't set out to do more than it desires to achieve, and in an age of indie games that always over-promise and in cases more often than not, under-deliver or don't deliver at all, Dorfromantik is a fresh breath of air in a vein similar to Slime Rancher for me.

The graphics aren't impressive and don't need to be. They're good enough to be enjoyed and the simplicity of how everything appears is perfect. The music, while relaxing, kind of makes me think of Minecraft... which hilariously makes sense, given the kind of direction this game was aimed at. Minecraft on peaceful has very relaxing music you can build and mine to. If that is the goal, it has been reached.

In short, I definitely recommend Dorfromantik. Buy this game while it's still 10 dollars, or get it on sale. It's surprisingly good. Seriously."

I love this game! I had a stroke which left my right hand non-functional where games are concerned, so I end up stuck with turn-based games. I've clocked in an embarrassingly high number of hours on Civ VI and really don't like story driven games (I'll just go read a book!), so am always on the look out for something I can play.

This game is appropriately challenging and engrossing. It also checks off my 'easy to learn, hard to master' requirement, though I do often get burned by RNG often enough.

Eventually, it does get a bit monotonous. I'm honestly not sure what the dev could do to make the game life longer. I suspect this will be fun to come back to and play a game or two every few months for quite a while, though. It's very relaxing, and when the RNG isn't being outrageous, far more engaging than frustrating. Definitely recommended if that's the type of game you're into."

My father recently passed away, and it has been hard to play a lot of the games i normally play. It just doesnt seem as much fun as it ust to be. This game, however, let me put my mind at ease while playing. The overall puzzle, design, and the way things flow feels very soothing.

I was able to relax, let my mind wander to the soft music, and just build. It has helped a lot, in just the couple hours i played, to help me refocus and feel more confident about resuming my life. This game came at the right time for me.

I would def recommend.

There is one reason and one reason alone why I bought this game. It's the video on the store page.

I wanted to reward the creators for having an actual video on their store page with a voiceover that explains what the game is about and shows gameplay. Far too often these videos and screenshots tell you absolutely nothing, but these guys nailed it on the head. Reward them by buying their game, would do again.

The game itself is not quite up my alley, but it is great to pass time, when you don't know what else to do and don't want to commit to something big. It's a great passtime and you get exactly what they introduce to you.

This game has become my 'second job'. It takes a while to get your head around all the possibilities but once you do. Even at 158 hours in I just learned/realized something that allowed me to get my new high score – 17770. Now I’m looking forward to playing again with my newfound knowledge.

The game is a mix of so many others, The obvious settlers of Catan, memory (where do I need that tile with one house next to one forest?), matching (I got a perfect perfect tonight! That’s 7 perfects at once). So much planning and very high stakes; one wrong click could ruin your entire game (I understand the debate but an undo button would really change the game).

I’m a lifelong player of video games (I refuse to call myself a ‘gamer’). This game has brought together so many things I love and have missed in video games. From a simple idea, with simple rules comes a game with such depth and complexity; its replay value is astronomical (see 158 hours in 19 days).

Dorfromantik is a very nice puzzle development game where you have to put hexagonal tiles together with the matching ends.
The game is easy to understand, but if you aim for a higher score, you have to plan several placements in advance, which is always made more difficult by the randomly generated cards.

Oh, you're probably wondering about the game, cause this is supposed to be a game review...

This is a relaxing casual game with just enough challenge to keep it interesting. If you've had a hard day and just want to play something to relax and zone out, this is a good candidate. The artstyle is fantastic. The way some of the tiles will slightly change to match the neighboring tiles is neat. The little animations made me smile when I saw them for the first time. As you get more and more tiles, it's impressive to see how large the map can get.

I can recommend this unless you're expecting anything that was listed under the heading of ""What Dorfromantik does not offer"". That being 4X Strategy, Trading, Resource Management, Combat & Violence, Multiplayer."

Dorfromantik. On the surface a simple, tile based puzzle game. But hidden behind it's cute, cardboardy art style is a menacing demon of complexity. If you enjoy puzzles, this game will tickle your brain in the best and worst ways. With an extensive selection of randomized tiles, you will soon find yourself entrenched in creating tiny villages, giant forests, winding rivers and interconnected systems of railroads. The amount of discoverable ""secret"" tiles that you can unlock through in-game quests are astounding, and make for an incredibly compelling experience. If you enjoy brain teasers I would throughly recommend picking this up."

This game has become one of my favorite games to sit down and be challenged as well as being able to have a relaxing game at the same time. Another easy to learn game that really provides a challenge without overtaxing your brain.

The premise is to match 6 sided pieces of varying make ups, including: water, railroad, forest, houses, grass and field, as you are giving one piece at a time to match onto the playing field. You can rotate pieces to fit them together with an already placed piece. You do have a limited amount of pieces to start a regular game but you can add back to your total by completing quests. Trying to get a high score is the goal in a classic game.

As you play a game another goal is to build out to a piece that is away from the main starting area, doing score gets you score and special pieces to unlock. The game has seven modes to keep you occupied with a change of pace. A tutorial is first, then classic, creative, quick, hard, monthly and custom. The tiles can be customized to certain looks with the use of biomes, which you unlock as you play. You can choose what biomes you want to appear in a game.

This game is really a no rush game, you can take your time as much as you like to find the best location to place pieces. You really have to way the pros and cons of piece placing as getting perfect placements can get you big scores but you have to continuously complete goals/quests done to keep getting more tiles.

A great addition to the game is the awesome music, you kind of lose yourself in it as you play. Very original, and enough tracks to not get bored of any of them. I now have to talk about the art style, it's AWESOME! It fits this game perfectly and is conducive relaxation. I just love the little animations that begin with some of the tiles when you place them.

This game is highly recommended if you love strategy/puzzle games that let you work your brain while also relax. You will be spending many hours blissfully gaming with Dorfromantik."

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Dorfromantik is a wonderful city builder game that aims to provide the most calming and relaxing experience possible by keeping the gameplay minimalistic yet extremely addictive. Since ISLANDERS was released in April 2019, several other games using more or less the same mechanics appeared on Steam, but none of them managed to capture its inner brilliance. After having experienced Dorfromantik fully, I strongly feel that it has the potential to be a worthy competitor, if not even better than ISLANDERS in some ways.

The core ideas of the two games are the same: you begin with an empty environment that contains an already set default tile, then you build up your landscape by placing down title by tile, expanding in all directions and gaining points by arranging them in an optimal way. While offers a choice between two packs of buildings belonging to the same type as long as you don’t have enough tiles, in you are by default given a stack of random tiles, with only the topmost one always being usable. The gameplay is thus simplified a lot, and the decision making shifts towards determining what the optimal spot for placing this tile is, based on the existing configuration.

The tiles are randomly generated mixes of five different elements (houses, fields, trees, water, railroad), featured in various shapes and amounts, but most of the times it's a combination of 2-3 different elements, with the water and railroad bits being more difficult to handle than the rest. Some of these tiles give you a quest when they're placed on the map, requiring you to connect a certain amount of tiles to them.

The core gameplay basically consists in -ing these in such a way that they form separate areas, in preparation for upcoming quests which are essential for game progress. Completing quests is what gives you survivability (they add new tiles to the stack) and increase the score, together with placing tiles in optimal spots for bonus points. Just like in , you might want to group related tiles together even outside quests, building up those points in preparation for the moment when you receive a quest tile that you can place down nearby for instant or almost-instant completion. However, one crucial difference between these two games is that the placement of building in is done based on the radius of the master building, while in the tiles can be chained together over any range, as long as the elements keep the connection among two adjacent tiles. In , gathering points is done through pixel-perfect placement and cramming together the maximum amount of buildings of the same type, both horizontally and vertically, while in the hexagonal grid expands only in 2D, allowing only a strict placement but the points can be collected from any amount of linked tiles.


There are two types of quests: those that require you to have a minimum amount of elements in the connected tiles, and those that ask for an “exact” number. While the ones from the first category are pretty easy to complete initially, those that appear mid-game towards the end game have considerably increased requirements. For example, the first quests are connecting 10-30 trees - easily doable with only a couple of tiles, while later this value scales towards several hundreds, requiring you to already have connected several tiles with the same elements. The quests that require you to have an exact number of elements linked are substantially more difficult because you will need to wait for the right tile to drop. That’s where you truly become a slave of the RNG, praying that you get a tile containing not 5 houses, but 2 only - because that’s what you need in order to complete the quest (and connecting a 5-houses tile would ruin it). For some of these quests, there's an optional requirement to close the opened edges, which further complicates things due to the fact that you’ll need to preplan the positioning so that you can easily close these off for extra tiles.

Completing quests will not only award you points, but also add new random tiles in your stack - and without tiles you can’t progress further. Therefore, finishing as many quests as possible should be your main priority, in order to generate the maximum amount of tiles in the stack. In practice though, because the RNG is what controls your gameplay (more or less), you’ll end up having several quests that can’t be completed and in the end you’ll just run out of tiles, while waiting for those fitting ones. Unlike in , where you need to reach a certain score in order to progress to the next island, here you can start as many game sessions as you like, with the score having an influence only on the additional challenges that you get in one gaming session. There are always 3 random challenges attributed (like building a water chain that is 50 tiles long or reaching 5000 points) which are made available in a progressive manner (as soon as you complete one, you unlock the next tier of the same challenge). Additionally, special tiles exist on the map - if you expand enough to reach them and complete their quests you will receive a random reskin for an existing tile.

In my opinion, one thing that is missing from the game is the ability to undo your moves, even for a limited amount of times. It happened more often than not that I misplaced a tile, thus breaking my existing configurations, and there was no way out from that. Several other people requested this functionality but the developers agreed to take this into consideration only in a later update. Also nice-to-have would be the ability to postpone some tiles for later use, thus saving some of these randomly generated tiles for quests with exact requirements, instead of wasting them on the current configurations. However, the devs are inclined to keep the gameplay unchanged, in order to not overcomplicate it with such features.


The game can be played with the mouse only or with a combination of mouse and keyboard that you use to rotate the tiles and the camera. The quest requirements are visible
on the map above the quest tiles and are instantly updated when you hover a potential placement spot with the currently active tile. This way you can easily see if you can get progress towards a quest by placing it on that spot, plus, all the tiles connected to the current one are highlighted. The opened edges are also highlighted on hovering the quest tile. The game makes it as easy and comfortable to you as possible and gives you all the information you need, leaving you only with the decision of where to place the tile.

In terms of achievements, prepare to spend at least 40-50 hours in it, if not even much more. The achievements are awarded for completing the challenges which grow exponentially in difficulty as you progress through the game, plus several challenges (reaching highscores for example) will have to be completed multiple times.

is a game worth playing and playing again. It never gets old, there's always a new goal to pursue and with each new gameplay there's a soft nudge towards bettering your strategies, while still keeping everything casual and chill. It's a game in which you can lose yourself for 20 minutes or for hours, in short bursts or in lengthy sessions, and you can play it as casually or as hardcore as you choose. Also, a Creative mode is in the works - I for one am excited to see how that will play."

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Yes, Dorfromantik is cute and charming.
Yes, this game is for puzzler masterminds for some brain training.
Yes, this experience is worthwhile for casual players too, but don’t expect an exceptional high score then.
Yes, you can rage during this game, no matter how relaxing it is. Once you realize there is no UNDO button and you misplaced a tile while just trying to drag the map then you could turn into a raging machine. Please don’t go outside and don’t interact with others when this happens. Ignoring this suggestion could cause reputation loss with humanity, world, neighbours, friends and family members.
Yes, Countryside Romance is addictive, so I decided to try the game after I obtained it. My initial plan was to do one or two games then play a strategy game which had a new DLC. Then 3 days and 48 hours later I realized I totally ignored all other aspects of my life.


Dorfromantik is a simple but genial puzzle game. You start the game with 40 tiles and you need to place them on the board/map. Each tile has 6 edges and random objects placed on all of the edges. These could be: grassland, water, railroad, forest, house(s), some agricultural object (wheat probably). You can’t choose what tile you get, you will get them randomly and you need to build up an as big as possible countryside idyllic world using those tiles.

How to do that?

Eventually you would run out of tiles so you need to finish quests, like create a connected system of 50 houses, 10 railroads, etc. These quests show up on tiles you could place, but it keeps increasing and its required number is in relation with the size of your current biggest, expandable area. So when you have 50 connected houses and you could still expand that, then you will get quests which ask for 60-75+ houses, when you have 200 it will ask 220-250+. The additional amount is asked keeps increasing as you progress in the game.
Don’t be afraid, if you closed your forest with 1500+ trees and now your biggest expandable forest has only 200 trees, then you won’t get a tile with 1700+ trees quest requirements, it will be again only 250-400+.

The reward for solving quests is 5 new tiles and when you place tiles perfectly (all 6 edges bordering the same type) you will get an additional tile too.

Loving it! Well worth the cheap asking price. Don’t hesitate if you like puzzles or relaxing games, just click the buy button. 97% of the players could be wrong, but I don’t!:-D
Visuals: 10/10
Narration: no narration, very very basic english required during tutorial, but could be played without english knowledge or be played by a kid for some logical education.
Sound effects/tracks: 9/10, very relaxing
Atmosphere: 10/10
Difficulty: 6/10, well, if you are trying to get a 30k high score and do all challenges.
Amount of crash: zero on win10
Games, similar to Dorfromantik: I didn't remember for any Joe The Eskimo suggested Islanders is similar.

Perfection time: ~80h+. Really depends on skill. There are some challenges and a few grind achievements. You can “work” only on 3 achievements in a single run, as only 3 active unearned challenges available during each run. Some, like a 75 size long railroad line, 100 size long river/water system and 30k high score are very challenging, but once you have patience for it you can do it too. My current highscore is around 75k, so while challenging, it is not too hard:

It is a really awesome game, if you want to relax your brain then you can do that, if you want to stress your brain and go for a high score then you can also do that. Very beautiful graphics and tiles, everything matches up really nicely. The small trains and boats are also really awesome, they make the game feel alive.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUGGESTION: I would like to make a suggestion: There should be two different modes instead of creative.
First: Sandbox | You get to choose what tiles you place and can just build for fun.
Second: Unlimited | It's like Sandbox and Standard, you get unlimited tiles but you don't get to choose them, I think that would be cool because It's like standard: you don't know what to expect, but it's also like sandbox: no limit. I also think you should add save games so if you have an awesome map in any of the three (or two) modes you can save it with a name and come back to it. I also think you should be able to free cam/hide the HUD (unless that is a thing and I just haven't noticed it yet).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So anyways, good luck with making the creative mode and hopefully you guys consider my recommendation! Thanks for reading this and have a great day/night!"

TWO PARTER:
Really disagree with most of the reviews here. I found the game frustrating, stressful, and honestly completely not the relaxing experience I hoped it would be. Do you get gorgeous vistas and peaceful music? yeah! absolutely. But the stretch goals to unlock new content seem frustratingly just out of my reach. I spend so much time checking tile placement, splitting out rails from rivers to reduce placement, and trying to dial in all the quests but despite my best efforts and plenty of skin unlocks I can't complete a single major challenge!
I'm going to keep attacking this game on the good faith assumption that I suck and don't have enough practice and that I got some bad luck thrown in the mix. I'll see if I can put another update in after a few more hours.

ALRIGHT well I came around to liking this game. you have to un-learn some stressful and short-sighted strategies that other games praise. I prioritized building a puzzle that fits together best, and made every other concern secondary. It's going quite well so far! this game taught me to chill out L:-D"

I picked up Dorfromantik cause I needed a game I could just pick up chill with and leave without feeling the pressure to sit thru a game if I didn't want to.

I was pleasantly surprised to find that Dorfromantik filled that quota and more, game runs smoothly, music is cute if a little loud in the get go. graphics are adorable not super high rez or eye blinding, doesn't require you to put so much thought and you can just chill and create or if you are feeling like completing the quests for longer game play you can.

I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to just take a vacation without going anywhere, it's easy to pick up and put down, but it's just as easy to spend hours attempting to best your own high score.

And if you just wanna create un-ending landscapes you can with the creative option."

Relaxing? Yes, but also... strangely stressful. Under this whole aesthetic of idyllic central European countryside there's a surprisingly deep game of matching tile edges, managing groups, closing off regions, fulfilling quests. You can, of course, ignore all of that and play creative mode exclusively, but I'd feel like this would be a waste of game.

There are two reasons to pay attention to these systems. One - score. That one might not seem that important, but it's fun to try to beat your own high score! Besides, it often leads to achievements, which in turn unlock new tiles and biomes. And two - it replenishes your tile pool. See, your pile of tiles is always limited - and once you run out, it's session complete. So if you want to keep expanding your little world, you have to keep paying attention to these things.

The mixture of those systems and the incredibly chill aesthetic - both in terms of look and the soundscape - create a very unique and potent brew that just washes your worries away. And I think this is the main reason why the game is so beloved by many.

For example: this one time, I had a mental breakdown so severe, my entire concept of reality collapsed and even thoughts of suicide didn't bring any solace. I got out of it with the help of therapy, philosophy and some research, but what kept the mortifying existential dread at bay was this game. The chill feeling was strong enough to make me forget I spent too long gazing into the abyss, and undoubtedly made my recovery quicker.

With all that said, I wish the game had more object types on the tiles. There are only 3 common ones (there's more, but they're much less common): houses, trees, and fields. I get it, that's rural Europe for you, but we also have mountains! Meadows! Swamps! Admittedly, the devs are from Berlin (I think), and the state of Brandenburg is almost completely flat - so maybe that's what they were going for.

I wasn't sure if I'd like Dorfromantik, but it entered my life when I needed it, and returned some kind of peace to my soul. I won't claim it would do the same to you, but I'd say it's nice to place a few tiles every now and then."

Imagine you are playing a jigsaw puzzle, but someone else has all the pieces and only gives you a few at a time. After about 10 minutes or 10 hours of praying for the exact tiles you need, you run out of them.

Its a jigsaw puzzle you always lose, and for some reason I'm hooked. It was never about winning in the end, its about how far you go. Its easy to pick up and play for any amount of time, the stakes are always low, and the art is pleasing. Goes best with your morning coffee."

At first glance, this game is a rather chill and simple game. Rotate the tiles, place said tile in the most effective spot for a high score, complete requirements to continue building your world. If you're an individual that is accustomed to strategy and puzzle games, this game may be right up your alley.

Now, I'll be completely honest when I say I was not expecting how hard I was roped into this game after a couple rounds to a point where its slowly becoming one of my go-to games to pass the time. I find myself getting too invested in my worlds that I built on top of planning my next tile placements, and next thing I know I start watching a little world develop in front of my eyes. So much so to a point I start building areas and create little backstories. A lone house near a body of water? lets try to make it look like a destination beach house! Watermill? Lets make a small village right beside it with a train system passing through.Admittingly, sometimes tile placements dont work out in your favour after some time and some areas become a mess. However, there is a creative mode for those just looking for a world-builder.

There is no end to your creativity in this game, even if your goal is just to get a high score or create new worlds.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Follow our curator page: IndieGems if you like and want to see more reviews like this one.

is the perfect casual and relaxing tile-placing/landscape-building game to spend a few hours, except for the hours might feel like minutes and the weekend is up before you realized. At least for me there was such a strong drive to place a few more tiles or to try to finish up a few more quests before quitting. Before long, I was starting another game right after the previous one just ended, and I was having a blast.

is simple, you start with a preexisting blank hexagonal piece and you can join its adjacent edges to tiles that spawn randomly. You can see your current tile plus the next two in the stack, along with the stack size that's easily visible. Once you use up your final tile, the game is over.

Many tile edges can join up if they don't match. Houses, fields, trees, or open space can meet up with each other as your world expands, while river paths and train tracks must meet other compatible tiles to keep linking together on the appropriate edges.

Occasionally, you may see a tile spawn that is more versatile, a water tile or a water train station. The tile that's entirely water can be matched with adjoining land or any water edge, as long as there's not a hindering edge. The water train station is the wildcard tile that you want to see, because often it will resolve a tight situation.

Some tiles will also spawn quests, such as joining so many houses together, or maybe tress, fields, or water-containing tiles. Completing each quest will earn you 5 extra tiles added to your stack, to keep the game going a bit longer. Starting with 40 tiles may not seem like a lot, but you can make your game last hundreds of turns if you play carefully and with a bit of extra luck.

The game does a good job showing you at any time where you can place the current tile in your hand by highlighting all available spaces, so you won't be left wondering. This feature is great and I found myself subconsciously using it a great deal.

The game gives you a good starting interactive tutorial to get you going. After that, it's entirely up to you to do as you wish.

After playing for a while, I began to see more complexity in the game itself. I started to choose placements very carefully, trying to achieve higher scores or to maximize the effectiveness of the placed tiles. Quests become more scarce and more difficult to complete, as the world expanded and the tile stack dwindled quickly due to increasing demand from multiple regions of the map.

The high score can be something that you go after, and locally the game tells you what your overall high score is so that you can try to beat it. Maximizing the number of compatible edges makes each tile score higher, a feature I only started paying attention to after playing a few hours in.

Expanding outward with branching arms may come with a risk, one that spreads your resources out too thin without being able to complete enough quests to keep your game going. Or maybe you could have used some of those tiles in a tighter and well-placed cluster to give some significant points.

There's a risk-reward system of closing off groups of like-joined tiles. Sometimes you will see a flag pop up in a group and that means if you close off the group so that the cluster cannot further expand, you will get a points bonus. But keeping that grouping open might mean an easier way to complete the next quest.

My advice is still to keep it simple, don't over-think it, go and have fun.

The game will display 3 objectives on the screen for you whenever you start a new game. It's a random set of 3 from the ones available to you. If you complete these objectives, you will unlock some tiles and some skins that you might see in subsequent games, expanding overall visual appearances, while the overall game stays the same.

To obtain more objectives, you will notice some tiles out in the unexplored areas on the map show a clear outline as you get closer. Even closer, you get a gray tile pop up but it's only revealed when you place a tile adjacent to it. These are all quests that once you complete, you will unlock new objectives for subsequent games. Once again, it's really for people who really want to go after them. These objectives are people who want those extra diversely appearing tiles or the different biomes available on the overall map.

If you just want to casually play the game without worrying about these objectives, that's fine too. Like I already mentioned, the game does not change a lick in basic mechanics no matter how many objectives you finish.

My first-look video is here. It's the first game I played after the tutorial, and it lasted almost an hour:


Mouse is all you need. There are some keyboard controls for camera movement, but after your world gets bigger, the mouse is much more efficient to use by itself.

The game has really adorable visuals, you can see right away from the screenshots and videos. You have some degree of zooming in and out also.

The music is very subtle, it's nice but if you are playing for hours on end, it might get a little old. It's okay to play your own music. If you zoom into the tiles that have moving locomotives or boats, you can hear a bit louder sound effects. Zoomed out, they are not really audible at all.

Anyone looking for a casual and relaxing experience that's also a strategic puzzle game.

Launching into Early Access, the price is quite reasonable at $9.99 with regional pricing. The game is definitely worth it and has the polish needed to already not feel like it's still in development.

Of course any game can use some improvements, and so these are a few things I have identified as of writing at the beginning stages of Early Access that would make it a better game for me:
1. Wider zooming/movement possibilities. When the map gets rather sizeable at times, rotating and moving to and from different parts of the world can start to feel cumbersome. It would be nice to be able to have a wider zoom or a mini-map toggle that allows the player to click and go to another part of the map.
2. Quest tracker. Sometimes quitting a game and restarting later I feel overwhelmed by the number of quests on-going and have trouble keeping them straight in my head. An optional tracker would be fantastic.
3. Tile saving. I would love to be able to save a tile for later, from time to time. Just a personal wish, nothing more. The game mechanics work fine the way they are.
4. Infinite/Sandbox mode. The completely stress free, no end, just simply building more and more, shaping without worrying about the tile stack dwindling.
5. Optimization. The game runs smoothly, and the playing goes well. But when games have increasing complexity with more tiles added to the map, it starts to really use up computer resources.

is pure awesome fun even on Day 1 of its Early Access period. I cannot wait to see the additional updates and further development that may add more content or make it more polished. Its user-friendly interface and family-friendly appearances make this a game that anyone can play and enjoy. And, should you want some challenges, they are there too.

Get this game and start shaping some really neat looking worlds, one tile at a time!

Game is great fun, I really like it. Best part about this game is while I'm free from baby duty (being a dad) I play this in quick sessions and game resumes really fast even on a laptop power.
Game gives a quick gratification of achieving something cute.

Pros:
- Relaxing atmosphere is perfectly executed
- sound effects are varied and delightful
- music is great
- plenty of strategy and planning involved, despite the simple appearance
- hexagons

Cons:
- I found the learning curve a little frustrating for ~30 minutes because I didn't understand the differences between the 3 kinds of quests. But a little reading outside of the game fixed that for me, and now I find it quite a nice system. So maybe I just didn't pay enough attention to the tutorial.

This game is great."

I call my wife the Dork Romantik every time she plays this 10/10 game

I love RTSs and city builders, I have since the early days of Sim City and Warcraft II. I always wanted that sort of gameplay, but without the upkeep/conflict.

This is a relaxing, soothing game. It's not here to measure your epeen, it's not here to prove how much better you are than the computer/ai/opponent. This is a game to play when the day has been too much and you need to UNWIND.

Remember unwinding? Remember playing games for fun instead of endless challenge? Remember games as an escape from the horrors of reality? Dorfromantik does.

The gameplay is very similar to a hexagonal Carcassonne, where the challenge is in the tile laying not the upkeep and maintenance, but without Carcassonne's ridiculous point counting system.

I think even full price is well worth the enjoyment you can get from this.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
A sweet little timekiller. The rules are simple (just match the tiles' edges to create large fields/villages/forests), but that's not a bad thing — the complexity comes from the sheer number of possible combinations.

I like how there are different styles of play. Building, say, a huge field is chill and relaxed, while trying to score a chain of perfect placements demands concentration and can become challenging.

However, this game lacks interesting goals. Sure, they nudge you towards slightly different playstyles, but mostly it's just more of the same. Build a long road, then a longer road, then an even longer road. it gets repetitive after a while, and the game does nothing to spice it up.

Then again, I'm perfectly content with getting 20 hours of chill fun from a game like this."

Dorfromantik

Dorfromantik, could be romantik, but its not, its real GEM of a game, very addictive, relaxing, the music is very peaceful and a pleasure to listen to while playing. This game described in my own personal words is a score chasing puzzler and a very addictive , relaxing and enjoyable one at that. You get a random stack of hexagon tiles to place, place then carefully. so you get the best out of scores, turning them for best group placements, if you get a cross dont place, look for the best scores to get ticks. Spread out your paths and keep them grouped, I find it better than just plonking them any place, make the most of all sides if you can, sometimes you just cant. You can get good runs and bad runs, I just get lucky so I base my runs on good placements and luck. Sorry I cant describe this Gem of a game, but based on my play time and enjoyment, the game will not disappoint young or older players. I hope to see more options added to this game, like maybe saving a tile you cant place yet, by placing in another pile, and undo feature for poor placements perhaps, and maybe more biomes and animals to unlock. The game is great as is YES, but more would be even better. Game is EA and more will come Im sure."

The very definition of chill. There is a tactile feeling to tile laying games that translated extremely well to the digital media and as a puzzle it is genuinely satisfying. The pastoral setting is lovely but I can see how this could be easily modified to suit whatever theme you prefer (gimme my Warhammer Old World setting dammit!).

The lazy landscape is serene and the music soothing and there is nothing more satisfying than puzzling together a huge dark forest and vividly imagining the horrors that lurk within ready to terrorize the local town if their greedy inhabitants ever get too close to the woods stringing up their bones like chimes in the trees as a testament to the might of the Horned King!

I did not find this game relaxing.

It bills itself as a relaxing puzzle game in the style of Carcassonne - take the next tile, place it where it fits best, and continue until the end of the game. It's the ""until the end of the game"" part where the relaxation turns into stress.

Each game you're provided a limited number of tiles. When you run out of tiles to place the game ends. To increase the number of tiles in your stack you're given ""quests"" to complete. These quests fall into two categories: ""get N or more tiles of this type in a group"" or ""get exactly N tiles of this type in a group"". A river with exactly 5 tiles, a city with 10 or more houses, a forest with 30 or more trees, etc. These quests grow in magnitude as the game progresses (River with 20 tiles! City with 100 houses! Forest with 400 trees!)

Instead of trying to place tiles to where they best 'fit', matching their features with the terrain, you're forced to cultivate large groups of like features to appease the quest system. You can't have a handful of small towns, you have to have a massive metropolis (that 300+ house goal isn't going to complete itself!). You can't have a countryside with sporadic forests, you have to have a dense wilderness. You can't have several small farms, you have to make an industrial-scale agricultural zone.

This is made worse by the ""exact number"" quests. You'll simultaneously be dealt a quest for a 200+ group of houses at the same time as a group of 12 (no more, no less) houses. You need to place the tiles close enough to eventually satisfy the former goal while not yet connecting them lest you sabotage the latter. Here's hoping the tiles are contiguous and of the right type: not too large so as to go over the exact number needed, yet not too small so as to ""cap"" the group and prevent it from expanding further.

The result is a micromanaging nightmare, trying to place your tiles in the exact ways needed to satisfy the quest system while at the mercy of the random tile generator. There is no time to relax, you have to worry exactly how best to place the next random tile so as to put a stopper in the ever-dwindling count of tiles left to place. All you can do is hope that the next tile has exactly two houses so you can complete that 12 house group quest and get 10 more tiles to complete the 200+ grain quest in order to get 10 more tiles to complete the 400+ forest quest which will give you 10 more tiles to complete the 30+ river quest which will get you 10 tiles to

Everything in the game from the art style to the music is designed to be relaxing. Everything except the game itself.

I refunded my purchase."

A Roller Coaster Theme Park Sandbox Game
YouTube™ Video: Planet Coaster Workshop Spotlight || The Walking Dead Roller Coaster 
Views: 1,163
If you own Planet Coaster you can download the park here: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=883697908&searchtext= 🌟-Join my Steam Group:...


There's a lot to love about this game, but i'm just going to mention a few things that surprised me.

+ Workshop support. Some people have created some unbelievable roller coasters and theme parks that are absolutely amazing! Even if you don't care about designing your own park or own rides you can easily find user created ones and ride them yourself which to me was extremely entertaining! ( I suggest checking out the Walking Dead Roller Coaster, Alice in Wonderland, and one called ""Dread Horror Roller Coaster"" which has it's own custom music )
+ You can import your own sound or music files for any ride in your park, and it's extremely simple to do so.
+ Designing my first roller coaster was surprisingly simple and very intuitive. It'll take maybe 5-10minutes to learn, but once you do you will be able to build anything you can imagine and test them out.
+ First person view for every ride in the park! There's also multiple other camera angles, and for me it was a joy to just watch people ride all the rides in the park.
+ Water raft rides and Go Karts!
+ Loads of other rides all of which you might see at real theme parks
+ A sandbox mode with unlimited money
+ A variety of challenge levels that have you fixing up a not-so-good pre-built park.
+ The soundtrack of planet coaster which plays in the main menu and in-game is absolutely wonderful. Very relaxing and uplifting.



- If a ride is too scary people won't ride it. While this may be ""realistic"" I was very disappointed in this. I like to build elaborate insane roller coasters, and it's a shame no one in the park will ride it...even if it's free... :,(
- There's not very many pre-built shops or decorations. The one's that they give you at the start also have wildly different themes, and don't seem to fit in very well unless you design your own.
- Strangely enough, I didn't really get into the whole thrill of designing my own park. Once you get a few shops, some rides, and plop down some staff the game plays for you and there's really not very much ""management"" to be found."

10/10 Recommend

Pros:
+ The developers keep updating the game for free (third one so far)
+ A lot of different scenarios and other modes
+ Possibility for so much uniqueness and creativity. I never realised how creative I was, but this game is pushing my potential!
+ Workshop content. Sometimes, I am unable to create super-awesome things, but luckily, hundreds of other people can and they upload all their creative creations online!
Update: +Another Free Update even though they did publish paid DLCs! YAY ME!

Cons:
- Requires a lot of time and patience to practice the placing of objects and creating your artistic vision
- I find that there is a limiting restriction on building walls and roofs, which might leave you a bit dissatisfied. I am sure there is a work-around by using much more objects as resources, but it is more tedious than I'd like it to be.

TLDR: Amazing game, get it as long as you can be patient to learn and to explore your creativity."

Funny story about this game. I bought it about a year ago, played for an hour and switched it off. The controls and navigation were frustrating me. A year later I decided I'm gonna give this another try. What I am about to say is not to be taken lightly as I have played all the theme park builder games and tycoon games back to the windows 95 days. THIS IS WITHOUT A HINT OF DOUBT THE BEST THEME PARK BUILDER EVER! It is so aesthetically pleasing and the creative freedom is close to limitless! Once you get past the awkward barrier of in game navigation you will love every aspect of it. The career mode is fantastic and it is not the type that you will just want to rush through to get it out of the way. Frontier have taken theme park builders to a whole new level! Amazing!"

If you played roller coaster tycoon as a kid, this game will bring you back to those same feelings. But now park managing and roller coaster building is far more advanced with several variables to take into account and overall happiness in the park.

PROS:
-good graphics, nothing too realistic so the game will be around for a while
-great fun music that actually makes you want to gor to a park
-Many game modes including the nostalgic sandbox mode where you can build whatever you want without thinkning of prices or customer happiness
-camera view on a rollercoaster so you yourself can follow along just like a customer.
-good sound design
-flawless animation from what Ive seen so far
-building builder, so you can design your own buildings to whatever style/theme you want.
-WORKSHOP

CONS:
-once your park reaches a certain size, your frame rate really starts to tank fast
-not as many premade buildings as Id like, but it does force you to make the park your own"

Going into Planet Coaster I had high expectations. I hadn't played theme park games for a while and heard great things about Planet Coaster. Besides that, It's from the developers of Rollercoaster Tycoon 3. Starting out I decided to try the career mode, something I recommend all of you to do. It explains the basics of the game throughout all of the missions and shows you a bit what the game has to offer. At first, the game seemed flawless. Everything about it was perfect. But although Planet Coaster is one of the best games i've played in while, it has it's flaws.

So what exactly are these flaws i'm talking about and are they really that important for your experience? Well.. That depends on why you're buying Planet Coaster.
The main flaw with the game seems to be the management system. At first it seems great, but soon enough you'll find out it doesn't really have that much depth in it.
Now is it really all that bad? No. there's still a decent amount of management to be done. From choosing the prices of your rides to deciding how much salt you wanna sell on those delicious frites. Unfortunately sometimes you get the feeling not every decision you make in the management part of the game really matters all that much.

The game is more build focussed. With a ton of scenery items you can pretty much create/recreate everything you want. And building is really well done. Yea it has it flaws, like objects needing to be split from a building in order to rotate/place it properly etc. but overall it works really good. Often enough i found myself casually building looking at the clock only to realize i've already been working the whole night on this small building since the game offers you so much options. A few downsides to the building system however are: Water being really hard to place and creating coasters can be difficult thanks to the Fear/Excitement/Nausea ratings.

Now 1 thing needs to be said when writing a review about Planet Coaster. the game looks absolutely gorgous! The cartoonish style, the water effects, the lights at night, the details and animations. It's just looks perfect. The game runs really smooth aswell, until... you start building a real park from scratch. At first everything seemed to run great, but after a couple of thousand objects the game starts to lagg/stutter especially when zooming in or out. And yea, you will have thousands of objects in your park. Creating a ride will easily put you at 1-2 thousand objects. But i still found myself walking/flying through my own park often enough just because everything looks and sounds so amazing. Because yea, the sound in this game is amazing aswell. People cheering, the water and all of the different ride sound effects make it feel like a real theme park.

The support this game gets is insane, and it gives me hope. Apparently there are still developers out there that care about their game after release. Lots of free updates with bug fixes, new scenery, new rides/coasters and even new mechanics are are being released every couple of weeks. Next to these amazing updates, the developers actually take time to interact with the players. They listen to what their fans want and every week they feature the best creations placed on the workshop in their stream.

Before buying, just keep in mind, this game is aimed mostly towards building. This requires you to be a bit creative otherwise you'll find yourself with a lack of ideas since the game doesn't have that much premade scenery/rides. However, the workshop makes up for that part in my opinion. Besides that i highly recommend this game. It's probably one of the best, if not the best theme park game you'll found out there, atleast for me it is."

I abslolutely LOVE this game. I am in my 40s and I actually design attractions for real parks for a living. Alot of people talk about the lag and the game play. I have found that if you keep simplicity in mind and create large parks with only scenery where the guests would see it in reality, keep your que lines decorated with simple landscaping and flora, use only a few props for decorating purposes and keep a nice clean and open approach, you will have seamless and enjoyable play. It is very realistic in it's management, marketing and security features, as well. If you start with a small area, only allow 200 in your park, let it become popular, then add an area, allow another 100 people in and so forth. You will find that the park almost runs itself with very little problems.

I am an old school RCT player. I have created rides and content for RCT3 for a long time. This game made all of that so much easier and the ability to share creations with others is one of the best features of this game. Would I change anything? Not really. Frontier seems to be on top of things and the updates and customer service is near perfect. So in closing, remember this: There are folks like myself out here using this program to create the new and exciting things you see in the real world every day and using it to test reactions and popularity. It is truly a theme park creator in the most literal sense."

How do you manage the expectations of a 10 year old obsessed with roller coasters? He thought this game would be the same as walking around Thorpe Park which he adores.

But on every level this game has exceeded his hopes. He can build dramatic roller coasters with some effortless clicks, he can follow the amazing looking people as they walk around and it's like he's really there. When first water rides were released he couldn't believe how amazingly realistic the water is, or how the animatronics moved and worked.

The game has grabbed him and allows him to be incredibly creative - he loves the rides but because creating the scenary is so simple and intuitive he's not just creating rides but making them look beautiful too.

The sounds, the sights, the excitement and sheer immersion of this game is outstanding and full of depth and imagination. Being combined with Steam Workshop means he can use and be inspired by other people's creations too.

And when he's in bed I can play with the scenarios and tinker with the endless array of management settings too but all I'm really hoping for is that Frontier make a theme park world I can land my ships from Elite: Dangerous on."

I absolutely love theme park simulation games. The entire RCT series I adored. I am happy to confirm, that is game is in fact a great game and makes a good spiritual successor to the RCT series. The precise detail of this game is amazing, and though others complain about the management, I personally think its great.

However I can absolutely NOT recommend you buy this game.

It is a shame that Frontier had to make the extremely poor decision to lock so much great content behind DLC. Even to this day I look at a DLC pack thinking ""Wow, that is a cool ride and would make a great addition to my park"". Then scroll down to see it is a whopping 16 DOLLARS FOR A FEW NEW BLUEPRINTS AND A COUPLE EXTRA RIDES? It is absolutely unbelievable. This game had so much potential, but Frontier's shameless greed has turned this game into a micro-transaction cash-grab. Let me rephrase that- a MAJOR-transaction cash grab, because for the deluxe edition (all of the DLC), it totals 110 dollars for a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ theme park sim.

Come on Frontier, I desperately hope you read this review. You have buried this game in unacceptable DLC-based bullcrap and I am started to lose the itch to play it. It is absolutely brutal how many features in the DLC should have just been added to the game. If you even do update the game that is, because lately it seems you have only been adding new DLC.

I could rant about this for so long but I should probably stop now. Frontier has lost my respect for this disgusting materialism.

EDIT: This review was posted 4 years ago; however, I still have absolutely ZERO shame in writing this. Go take a look at Planet Zoo if you haven't. The amount of DLC for that game has already surpassed the amount for Planet Coaster and the game hasn't been around nearly as long. RCT 3, which was arguably the best theme park management game, only had 2 DLC which completely innovated the game. Frontier chose the contemporary micro-transaction model for their games, introducing high-priced DLC for a low quantity of content.
If you want to disagree with me and pay enormous sums of money to enjoy these games completely, that's fine. But I would start re-evaluating why you're meat-riding this company when they are malicious enough to allow you to USE the DLC, but not save it in your park. DIsgusting."

I played this game and thought it was gorgeous. Then I realized I had it on the lowest graphics setting.

I want to call this a worthy successor to the Roller Coaster Tycoon series. Worthy, yes. Actually, Planet Coaster is so good it utterly eclipses anything that's come before it. But a ""Tycoon"" it is not. Those games emphasized management, and while Planet Coaster has that, it's not the focus. Planet Coaster is all about building. It reminds me of the earliest Sim City titles, where you lost yourself expanding your city--zoning, power plants, density and all that. The hurdles of tax management was more a welcome speed bump than the reason you play the game.

That's what Planet Coaster feels like. It's 1 a.m., and you're putting little lanterns in your digital castle, but you bite your lip and second-guess those stone colonnades. Are they tacky? Do they clash with lintels? Technically, you're only supposed to be doing this for some scenery rating, but it was 100 percent thirty minutes ago and now you're planting Tuscan Cypresses everywhere. It's sounds like a pain in the ass, and the first time you do it, it is, but you learn the keyboard shortcuts, get a bit patient, and then it's pure zen. Later, sleep.

Is Planet Coaster a great game? Kinda. You can't teach a computer (yet) what makes good aesthetics, so the Roller Coaster Tycoon games have always relied on their players to be wacky perfectionists who are willing to build real parks rather than exploity thingamajigs. Because, for all the intricate details, slaving over a coaster station for hours is the same as zapping down a few Golden Chests, beating the dust off your hands, and calling it a day. You can play Planet Coaster like that, just throwing down random scenery pieces in a big pile until you get 100%, doing min-max shenanigans. In another context, this spammy behavior would be considered a weakness of the game. Only a game like Planet Coaster is it considered a weakness of the .

But that's all OK. Because Planet Coaster isn't supposed to be played. It's an experience, like hanging out in your zen garden, spreading happiness and joy for the fun of it. Not to mention it's gorgeous, and runs as smooth as cream on high graphics settings.

I'm working on a ""starry kingdom"" themed park right now. Meanwhile, I'm trawling their youtube, hoping to get a glimpse of what else is coming out. I got my fingers crossed for hotels, a Halloween theme, and restaurants."

Ever since my mom bought me a one dollar copy of ""Roller Coaster Tycoon 2"" at Dollar General when I was 12, I've had a special place in my heart for theme park sims. The feeling of unbridled creativity and freedom that RCT2 was unrivaled for quite some time... games like RCT3, NoLimits, and Parkitecht were and are fantastic games/sims, and I enjoyed them (and continue to enjoy them) immensely. However, none of them ever lived up to my experience with RCT2.

Until now.

I'm going to start with the things I don't like about the game and gush about it near the end.

1.) The organization of building and scenery pieces is confusing. There doesn't seem to be much logic in the way ""Scenery"" is separated from ""Building,"" even though you can find similar objects in both categories. It seems to me that the two tabs should be merged into one, and then subdivided for better organization.
2.) Some objects are stuck to a grid, and others are not. This makes it frustrating when you find the perfect piece to use, but it's constrained to a grid and cannot be turned upside down. A better solution would have been to give EVERY piece in the game a grid constraint and a free form constraint, then let us choose when to activate grid movement.
3.) There is no underwater effect.
4.) There is no weather.
5.) Park management from a financial perspective is really cut-and-dry. It isn't bad, it's just that the ""sim"" element of the game doesn't have much meat on its bones.

Okay, now that we got that out of the way, what's good about it?

The variety of coasters, rides, transport rides, shops, scenery, building items, music, and path styles is amazing. The graphics are incredible. The lighting is insanely good. The terrain tools are the best on the market. The level of detail and freedom you are given is astounding. The music and sound design are top notch. I'm running out of synonyms for ""really really damn good.""

On top of that, there is Steam Workshop support and the new Theme Makers Toolkit, which allows you to import your own 3D models into the game. Not to mention that Planet Coaster has one of the most amazing and helpful communities out there.

Just buy the game. Trust me."

The Rollercoaster Tycoon games were near and dear to my heart growing up. I love management and tycoon games, and for whatever reason the magic of theme parks made a really great video game. I’ve lost hours and hours to the scenarios in RCT 1, building in the sandbox in RCT 2, and playing with various trainers to break the game how I see fit. RCT 3, however, marked a rough transition into 3D. There were a lot of problems with the game, and I honestly never enjoyed them very much.

There’s business drama of some sort with the ownership of the name of the game, and there actually is an Atari published successor to RCT 3 called Rollercoaster Tycoon World, but apparently the verdict is that the entire thing is a hot mess. The folks who developed RCT 3, Frontier Development, went on to create Planet Coaster as a spiritual successor to the RCT series.

Although I didn’t enjoy RCT 3 very much, I’ve really loved my time with Planet Coaster, and I can already tell that I’m going to be spending a nasty amount of time with this game. There is a lot to digest here, and I think that a lot of the criticisms I have won’t apply to the majority of people who would be interested in buying this game. I think it is necessary to give the game two ratings – one for casual folks who are looking for a fun tycoon game, and one for people who have a Drexler patched copy of RCT 1.

It really seems as if Frontier aimed to make this game primarily a sandbox game with a dependence on user-generated content. The campaign is amazingly short, and some missions can actually be finished in a matter of seconds on accident. There are tons of coaster types, shop types, and scenery objects but very few ploppable pre-built options. The shops you can place down are little 1x1 generic box-shaped grid pieces that are clearly meant to be built upon, and the game also defaults you into a building view for constructing something around it. Very few sample coasters exist to play with. There are tons of generic scenery and building blocks for building cool stuff, though. If you’re willing to spend hours building things, you’re in luck!

The workshop support is really easy. You open it up in the shift+tab menu, subscribe to something, and it is immediately in your game. The workshop tagging needs a lot of cleaning up right now, and it can be difficult to find quality content. Even though the integration is pretty simple, it isn’t very fun to go hunting for good content to use in your maps. The really complex workshop items also sometimes come unfinished due to built-in limits the workshop has, which makes me wonder because this game really emphasizes the user-created content aspect. I’ve downloaded more than one item that requires me to build the roof, or place the paths, and it can get really frustrating to finish these things sometimes. Downloading maps and other things that people have worked on is a lot of fun, there are some really incredible things out there.

A huge problem I had with RCT3 is that building precisely in a 3D space is difficult. I have similar problems with Cities: Skylines when compared to Simcity 4; 3D spaces end up with weird curves and other buggy moments when building things. Planet Coaster is also victim to this. You’ll probably end up with lots of oddly shaped pathways and coaster supports. This is a difficult problem to explain but it becomes really evident when you’re trying to connect curved pathways together that are at slightly different angles. They’ll never couple together cleanly and leave weird gaps.

I have a lot of Quality-of-life problems that I wish this game had. I wish I could have my coasters constantly testing without a janky workaround, and I wish I could run ghost trains instead of constantly crashing real trains. If I’m in a scenario trying to build a coaster, it’s goofy that I can keep crashing my trains and hitting the peeps and nobody seems to mind. I feel like nobody on earth wants to delete their entire roller coaster when they hit the “delete” key while placing paths after they built a coaster. The UI is really ugly and feels like it is in beta still, and it is tough to navigate to find what I need.

I feel like the way the game measures stats for rides is somewhat broken, because I’ll have a coaster that has a great rating up until the last ten seconds where it brakes going into the station and slows down, and that little section will kill the average of my coaster making everyone think it is boring. I had a coaster in one map with a 135mph top speed and a 100 meter drop with tons of twists and lots of great moments, but because the last thirty seconds were a slow moment to ease back into the station, people in my park thought it was boring and avoided riding it. I used to be able to build incredible coasters in RCT1/2 (9+ excitement), but I can’t seem to break 5 excitement in Planet Coaster.

I have a lot of things I could say about this game, but ultimately Steam has a review limit, so I’m going to wrap it up.

I would not recommend this game if you are looking for a management game, or if the scenarios were the meat of your playtime in RCT1. You’ll likely blow through the scenarios very quickly, and you’ll definitely be frustrated at the lack of ploppable coasters and buildings. If you don’t enjoy sitting down to work on the right angle to bank your coasters, I would probably recommend skipping this game.

If you’re looking for a really hardcore sandbox to spend hours building the monster roller coaster of your dreams, this is probably your game. After all of your hard work setting up trigger points, banking turns, measuring speed, you can sit down and ride your coaster. Riding things is pretty damn fun after all your work is done.

If you also like to download things from the workshop, and think you could get a lot of fun out of downloading crazy things that people have spent hours working on, you could probably eek some good time out of this.

I have a tough time giving a good rating to this game, but I also don’t feel like it is a bad game. I feel like it is a lazy game. I don’t get why they didn’t include more ploppable samples for players to use. There are tons of coaster types, at least two dozen, and then there are something like seven sample coasters. That’s just silly, and these depressing numbers carry over to every part of the game. I don’t get why there are only nine measly scenarios. The sandbox maps the game ships with are boring flatlands. The whole thing feels janky.

But I know the potential this game has. With very little time since the game has released, folks have already build some incredible stuff. I’m very curious what is to come.

Whether or not you'll like this game boils down to whether or not you like intense creative sandboxes. This is not a good management game, even if the game makes an attempt at being one. The potential is certainly here, since you have some pretty powerful control over certain aspects of the park, such as opening times (which doesn't seem to change anything), staff management, and customizable options with vendors. The management side of the game can be totally trivialized by putting down a cluster of shops and rides very close to your entrance. Congratulations on the money farm.

If you're the kind of person who played Rollercoaster Tycoon, placed a balloon shop, and thought to yourself about how annoying it was that the balloon shop was a few pixels taller than all the other shops requiring an entirely special setup to fit it inside a building, then Planet Coaster just might be the game for you. This is the spiritual successor to those hundreds of hours we spent as a kid playing RCT1 with the Drexler patch and a trainer, or building sandbox coasters in RCT2, and even riding your custom rides in RCT3."

I love this game, its right up my alley, but heres whats bothering me. I get that you need to advertise your DLC's but its frustrating to have rollercoasters or other buildings in the game and when trying to use them get linked to the DLC's store page. Why not use the regular pop up windows in the main menu? I haven't even played for that long but its putting me off at this point, other games just exclude the DLC items instead of rubbing the fact that I don't have them in my face. Its not even motivating me to buy them either?
Other than that really fun game. Its a bit annoying to figure out how to play it since the tutorial is a bunch of videos instead of a playable sequence but that might just be me not being patient enough to have some guy explain the game to me."

If you love theme parks and customization...then you've come to the right place! This game is extremely addicting. I've already spent tons of hours just getting lost in detailing whatever creation that I'm working on at the time. To me, it's not so much about playing the actual game...it's about letting my imagination take over and build some really neat things that you might not see in real theme parks.

I love that the developers are continuing to add to the game. It could always use more objects for us to build with and more rides (not just coasters), but I'm sure they're working hard on it already! Great job Frontier!

I've been a stubborn RCT 1&2 fan for over 10 years now. RCT3 was a dissapointment, and after that I felt like the series was lost. Enter Planet Coaster. I must admit I was skeptical at first... but this game is absolutely fantastic. Everything, from the satisfaction of curved paths, to the terraforming and the massive choice of rides is spot on. Coaster building is intuitive and the game just looks gorgeous. Highly recommend not only for disenfranchised RCT fans, but also fans of this genre."

I expected a sequel to RCT3, and I got it, from the same devs, under name of Planet Coaster.

This is absolutely a great title for every fan of RCT franchise, it has everything it should, and support for Steam workshop which is truly great, opening doors to nearly every single thing you could ever ask for. I must admit that initially I was sceptical as making a sequel to a successful game usually leads to disappointment and overhype, but in this case I simply couldn't expect anything more - the game has exactly what I imagined, and while some extra content such as extra campaigns, rides and coasters are welcome, I can't really claim that there is not enough considering that there will be only more content in future, both from developers and the community.

I give it strong 9/10, and suggest to grab ASAP for every RCT fan that expects RCT3 in 2016.

Great Creative Game / Not So Strong Management Game

The creative side of this game is incredible and while building you really feel as though there are no limits.
The management side of the game is shallow and is basically the same model as the old Chris Sawyer RCT games. There is certainly a lot of room for improvement on this front and although the scenarios are generally quite well built, they lack the variety in their challenge. I imagine that this will be improved upon with updates down the line, but even without bolstering this side of the game, I can see myself getting more than my value out of the money spent.
Well worth it so long as you go in with the expectation that this is mostly a creative outlet and not so much a strategy/management game."
planet+coaster,Recommended,100.0,"Posted: August 18, 2020
I have no one to blame but myself for getting my hopes up; but, this is definitely not Roller Coaster Tycoon, it's not even really a ""tycoon"" game.

The store page quite clearly states this is a simulation, and simulation it is. You build a theme park and simulate some rides, but it's very much the sandbox without the game portion. Yes there is endless, potentially 100's of hours of messing around and building things just to watch it all flow like a fishbowl in front of you.

I can't slam the game for successfully doing what it claims to do, this is a very in depth and dare I say amazing simulation of a theme park. Unfortunately for me I was looking for more of a tycoon/management game so I'm a little disappointed; but that's not the games fault.

So, if you want a theme park simulation that let's you build roller coasters, I don't know of any that I could recommend that are better than this. But it is very much a simulation/builder.

I was one of the early birds. Bought this game in alpha stage one. It has come a long long way. And I can say this is the best coaster game if you're the creative type. There's so much customization you can't even wrap your head around it. Objects can clip so you can build literally everything!
The tools are intuitive, everything works very well, I LOVE the objects in the game (though they could always add more), the graphics are sublime, everything about this game screams ""BUY ME""! Frontier went for a cartoonish style, which works very well! Better than *cough* other games of its genre.

It's really easy to dive in and experiment! The building tools are very deep, and you can create anything you can think of!
A MUST-play for every fan of the genre!

Also: Crashing coasters into your guests is still as satisfying as ever! (I have posted a video if you're interested -Product placemenntttt.)"

On sale now at Frontier Store (steam key): https://www.frontierstore.net/usd/games/planet-coaster-cat.html I originally did not buy this because reviews said it was too easy.


Originally, the reviews for this game came back, and I wasn't interested. The reviews were not bad, I just noticed a recoccuring theme that the game was not hard, it did not provide a challenge.

Well, I'm here to tell you that my concerns were faulty, because of two reasons.

1. The game has a challenge mode, and the ""harder"" difficulty is definitely a challenge. It may not be quite as brutal as some other games, but it gave me what I needed.

2. Probably most importantly, I found that difficulty did not matter. The game challenges me in other ways. It didn't matter if the threat of looming bankruptcy from making one mistake was there or not. I need that in other games, like Transport Fever, for example. However, in Planet Coaster, I was challenged by making my people happy, and that is really what the entire game is about.

It is so much fun to build a good roller coaster. It is a huge challenge and there are near infinite possibilities. I found that you cannot just slap a bunch of pieces together. There is a true art to making people excited, but not too fearful and not too nauseous. You typically want a moment or two after some crazy loops or high-G turns to let their fear die off, but you have to time this properly otherwise their excitement will die off and then the ride will be a bust.

The above might be easy, if you didn't have to deal with darn natural laws, like gravity. So many times, I'd have the perfect combination setup, but then realize, that I didn't have enough speed for the track piece or combo I needed. By putting in a second chain lift at the wrong time, you could doom your ride to boredom.

I found it immensely pleasurable to craft a masterpiece to fit in with the terrain, or loop around buildings, all in an effort to strive towards making that ""perfect"" ride that is ever eluding me.

I would recommend this game to perfectionists or really, anybody who enjoys building games."

Ok, I had a LOT of fun with this game. I never player roller coaster tycoon but some compare it to that.
I was a bit confused when first loading it so I will try to help
The game has 3 modes
Career, Sandbox, Challenge.
Career is like campaign mode in other games, you start with a very mini park and you have to improve it to earn stars, that's it. You look up the objectives and try to meet them. Eventually you get into a grove.
Sandbox is wide open just build a park, no monetary constraints
Challenge is Sandbox but within a budget, you have to earn money in order to build things
I had the most fun with the career challenges. I finished most of them.
Quick tip, open sandbox to design your coaster for each level, then save that blueprint then use it in career. Trying to build the coaster WHILE running the park is hard."

This game is absolutely fantastic! A true love letter to Theme Park Sim enthusiasts and I very much love it!

So why am I not recommending it?

The large ammount of DLC.

As of today (12th of January 2019) there's 80€ worth of DLC, you could buy the base game TWICE with that money. Not only that but I feel that some of the DLC content should've already been present with the base game. The DLC rarely goes on sale and even if it does it's still far too expensive for what it is.

I know that I'm probably gonna get feces throw at me for saying these things by the more hardcore fans of this game, but what I'm saying is absolutely no lie. There is absolutely nothing wrong with supporting your favourite developers, but ever since Frontier figured out that ""Hey, we can just throw any DLC out there and people will buy it!"" they've gone down a ""Sims 4 DLC"" path.

I love this game, I may have not have spent as much time with it as I would have liked yet but I'll continue to play it on and off. I want it to succeed but if it continues on this path it'll simply be seen as another Paradox/EA game due to its DLC practices, losing a lot of possible customers and attention in the process.

If you enjoy designing beautiful parks with a little bit of management on the side, this game is great for you, bear in mind however that without the DLC you'll be pretty constricted with what you can do in terms of themes and rides and will have to use your imagination/creativity to their full potential (Which thankfully are still free on this day and age).
I don't recommend that you enable this excessive DLC practice by Frontier, thus you should stay away from the DLC.
But If you really want the DLC, make sure to get it heavily discounted, even if it means getting them outside of STEAM like on Humble Bundle.

Thank you for reading and have a wonderful day! :)"

This is undoubtedly the theme park simulator we've all been craving for since the days of Theme Park and Roller Coaster Tycoon.

While the management and tech progression could do with a little spit polish to bring it up to par against its simply outstanding construction features, this is nothing but an insignificant nitpick on an otherwise superb game."

It's a good chill game. Make sure you have a good CPU for the big parks. Unfortunate 80% of the game is in the $143 of DLC.

If you can get the game for under $20, get it. You will soon realize the lack of content in the main game. They show you the DLC in the game, which is 80% of it."

Design, build, manage

Wow this game. It’s what I’ve waited for after Theme park, which was one of my favorite games of the genre along with Theme hospital.
First I want to say if you’re a creative person just buy it, don’t think, just throw your money at developers and buy this amazing game. It’s designed for creative people, you can build anything, you can choose even the smallest details, design your park as you wish.You can design absolutely everything. Your rides, your shops, your paths etc. I'm not a creative person, i don't use everything the game has to offer but i still love it.

The game has different modes. Career where you’re given the map and partly built park and you must achieve the given goals. It starts from the easy goals and goes to challenging ones later when you progress further in career.
There also are challenge and free play mode where you could spend many hours.
There are different maps/locations and themes. You can build a fairy tale park or a pirate themed park or buy a DLC and build something else. Yes it has DLC, but developers are constantly updating the game and adding free content so I don’t see anything wrong with it.

Graphics are outstanding. I’ve never seen such graphics in this type of game. It looks better than some adventure/fps games. You can zoom in and see every detail, everything looks so nice and detailed, no pixels or anything. Park visitors are well detailed, park feels alive, people even have face animations which are on the level of Sims probably. Knowing there are hundreds or even thousands of people in your par it’s really impressive.
There’s night and day cycle, with correct lighting decorations the park at night looks beautiful, you can stare at it and forget that someone’s just got pickpocketed or someone just quit their job.

Of course the graphics come at a price. To see all the beauty you’ll need a good PC. I’m not saying it’s badly optimized, in my opinion optimization is very good, it’s just with such detailed graphics you can’t expect a big park to run on steady 60fps. But the performance is far better than cities skylines or some other games.

Sound pleases your ears from the moment you start the game. And park sounds just great. When you zoom in to a ride you feel like you’re really there. Developers done a great job in sound department.

Of course the game doesn’t end with designing and building your park. It has management. But this is what developers could improve. The management isn’t bad but not very good either. I would like to have deeper management system where you could really think what to do and how to improve your profits. Now it’s mostly increasing/decreasing the prices, taking loans and hiring staff. You still need to adjust these things but the whole management just not deep enough.

And don’t forget the workshop support, you can download tons of content from there.

I definitely recommend this game, the price is just right, developers not abandoning the game and constantly improving it. It will suck you in and after an hour you realize you’ve played for 3 hours.


Absolute freedom
Nice career mode
Stunning graphics
Good performance
Sound


Management could be better"

I've been playing this game non-stop for over two years now. I have always loved RCT and have been playing all the roller coaster tycoon games since the first one came out in 1999. While there are some aspects that can't be replicated from the ""classic"" games, this is the truest form of a sequel I could have ever imagined or asked for, and I feel so blessed to be apart of watching the game grow as it has. Writing this in 2020, I know most of Frontier's focus is in Planet Zoo right now, but the game has so much room to grow and I am excited for the future of Planet Coaster."

I played RCT2 and Theme Park World back in the good old days.
Unfortunately my old PC was way below the minimum requirements for this game.
This week i finished building my new expensive rig, i tested around and all was fine.
I bought Planet Coaster, started it and was already pleased by this beautiful menu, then i fired the beginners scenario up, and i literally cried.
This is the most beautiful game i have ever seen.
I immediatly went into ego-perspective of a visitor and just looked for half an hour at the scenery and the ultra-awesome details in this game.
This is a masterpiece.

Really cool and fun, my only issue is it really needs to be optimized. once you get a couple thousand people in your park the game comes to a grinding hault, I had a park where people were addicted to this one ride and about 3k people were all at the one line and it made my game save unplayable."

If you are trying to decide between this and Parkitect, be aware that they are two entirely different games with only a few similarities. Both are sims set in amusement park worlds and both use the Workshop to greatly enhance the play experience (although Planet Coaster goes well beyond that, which I talk about below). That's pretty much all that's shared between these two games which seem, on the surface, to be virtually identical. I play both of them and prefer Planet Coaster, although I have nearly 120 hours played in Parkitect as well (at time of update). Parkitect is a much more streamlined and slimmed down simulation and management game, whereas Planet Coaster is something that can go as far and deep as you want. PlanCo also runs on a powerful engine, so it looks amazing, but you will need to have at least a relatively modern GPU/PC that can handle the latest shaders and Direct X extensions and features. Planet Coaster goes big in the graphics department as well as the customization department, including a ridiculously huge Steam Workshop with nearly a quarter million blueprints available as I write this, but Frontier went even further than that...

As I mentioned before, PlanCo also offers the completely free Theme Maker's Toolkit, which allows you to import 3D objects that you download or create directly into the game and become usable game assets in the game library (as well as being a shareable blueprint for the Workshop), all automatically done by PlanCo's web app. Yes, you can literally create anything you want in this game as long as it meets some size and scope requirements. That is the of micro-management sims, in my opinion. However, it does take time and skill to create objects with Blender (free) and GIMP (free), but there are millions of free, compatible and completely ready-to-submit object renders out there, free to download. Not everyone has the time or desire to learn 3D object modeling for a Steam game, but someone out there has probably already made whatever it is you are thinking of (free or otherwise).

If you want to go down the rabbit hole of amusement park creation and simulation and want Challenge modes, Career modes, and micro-customization abilities in even a normal Sandbox environment, this is the game you want. If you don't want to spend so much time learning a game and handling the tiny details, but want to run an amusement park, look into Parkitect."

I came down with a stomach condition last year, wasn't able to eat much and when i did, I often ended up in a lot of pain, which also kept me from sleeping. When I was in a lot of pain one of the few things I was able to enjoy, and took my mind off it, was this game.

I'm not a super creative person and usually in games like this I just can't find where to start, or where to get inspiration. The pre built assets were really helpful to me and I enjoyed building coasters way more than I thought I would. Being able to get the block section times perfectly lined up with the load/unload times, and always having a car sliding into the station right after one leaves, feels amazing. The AI in this game are actually really good, they rarely get caught up on geometry, they load in the same way everytime. It's actually really reliable. The assets are gorgeous, and have a pretty timeless style, this game still looks good, even in the messed up way you're going to place things. There's isn't much music, but what's there is great. The main theme makes me feel really comfortable and safe. I don't know why, but when I launch it and I hear that music I just feel better. The attitude of this game as a whole is very positive, friendly and welcoming, and I think that is a large part of why I enjoy it so much.

It's not a perfect game, I do have some small gripes. It would be cool just to be able to paintbrush pathways and have big paved areas for seating and stuff. When you setup block sections you can only select how many trains you want running on your track, not which block sections you want them to start at. Which would be hard to do, but would be nice. It feels like the block sections are just kind of a happy accident if you can get the ones populated that you want at the end of building the coaster.

All that said, It's one of the best designer/simulator games I've played. I got it on sale, but I feel like it is worth full price. It's a comfort sort of game, if you're in a lot of pain, or in a bad situation, I highly recommend getting lost in the joy and nostalgia of building your own theme park.

Just as a tip, larger is rarely better. Scale down your rides and keep things a little simpler, and you'll have an easier time"

On one hand i absolutely adore this game. It's almost everything i & others wanted in a theme park builder after having to wait so long after RCT3 & avoiding the rubbish from that other company. It's gorgeous, full of content, can be challenging if you choose, full of nice details to create a realistic park etc.

However i can't not mention it's glaring faults;

1. They made the totally wrong decision to build on DX11 & not DX12. They've said themselves that's the reason for the poor performance once the park gets a little bigger & with more guests. It's so frustrating to have a game this good but unable to do anything decent with it. No matter what your specs. It's bottle-necked due to DX11 & the way it uses the CPU.

2. The management aspect isn't on the level it should be for a game like this. It needed more depth. Something they corrected mostly with Planet Zoo.

3. Due to the performance limitations (i think), the campaign parks they built all feel underwhelming, sparse & unrealistic.

4. Not as important but the water tech used could've been better (DX11 performance limitation decisions i imagine). It's better then nothing but it's not dynamic or fluid. Doesn't react to anything unless it's baked in. It would've been nice to use the great terrain tools to create realistic waterfalls/flowing rivers etc.

Don't get me wrong, i love this game. But every time i go back to it, i feel a little disappointed & frustrated knowing it could've easily been far better then it is.

I'm not holding my breath but i truly hope they make a second one sometime & correct these issue's. What a game that would be."

I've played all of the RCT franchise games. PC is by far the best rollercoaster game I've played so far. The devs actually listen to their customers making the gameplay even better.

I love this game. I can already say it is the best theme park game i ever played.

This game is so great because it is limitless in regards to building and creativity.
The amount of themes looks okay but once you start combining items from other themes together you can basically make any theme you can imagine.
Lovely graphics, art design and the detail is extraordinary and looks so realistic.

There is a good amount of Flat rides, a great amount of Coasters, 2 Transport rides and they even added some water rides like the log flumes and river rapids.
You can also make Darkrides and there are options to set trigger events to your rides and coasters.
For those who like their own music better then the ingame music, wich is great, you can add custom music to the rides and speakers.

The park management is very in-depth and allows you to do just about everything you need as a park manager.

My final verdict (based on theme park games): 10/10"

At first I liked the game. Then it felt like it was missing rides and other stores. Suddenly everything was releasing in $11 dlc packs. There are like 6 or 7 of them as well as many cheaper ones. I feel like there should be free updates to the game and not this much DLC. If there was a DLC pass for $30 or less sure, but the constant flow of $11 packs is insane especially when it feels like theyre worth much less."

Just ask yourself 3 questions:
- Do you like being creative?
- Do you like theme parks (not just roller coasters, if you just like coaster get no limits or whatever it is)?
- Does your computer meet the recommended specs?

If so, get the base game and see how you feel. The DLC isn't necessary at all but it does add to the experience. You can always add it on as you go.

If not, I'd say this isn't for you. The game's been out for a while now, raging on the forum will sadly fall on deaf ears or be swallowed up by the many, many fans of this title that would defend it until their last 5 fps."

Planet Coaster is one of those rare gems which hits that balance of strategy, management and creativity. Whether you're building a crazy rollercoaster, or creating a storefront piece by piece, you're going to find yourself sinking hours into this game, and loving every moment of it.

The career mode is a great place to start with the game, as it gives you very specific scenarios to overcome. It's a nice intro to learning all of the mechinics. There are a handful of scenarios to deal with, and each one gives you multiple tiers of accomplishment (bronze/silver/gold) to finish. I do wish there were more career scenarios, but the game has other modes which compensate for the lack of ""missions"".

Challenge mode is sort of an expansion on career mode, but is more free-form. You start a park that has specific goals, but it's almost sandbox in nature. Challenges are dynamically given out, and you must spend your limited income to build a successful park, and gain more revenue for future additions. There is technically no ""end"" to these challenge missions, from what I can tell (at least as far as I've gotten into them).

Sandbox mode is the ultimate creative senario. No monetary limits, no building or research limits. You can building anything you want, anywhere you want, and not having to worry about fiscal management. It's a great place to create structures or coasters that you can then save out as Blueprints, to print into your challenge worlds.

Building in the game is very fun. Building a coaster is accomplished via a system of dynamically generated spline sections, as well as pre-build sections of spirals/corkscrews and the like. There are many different types of coasters, from old wooden classics, to superman-style, catapult-launched modern coasters. Pretty much something for everyone.

The bigger artist element comes with the PBP (piece by piece) building method. There are a ton of individual assets in the game (sconces, lights, wall sections, pillars, and more) each fitting a general theme (wood/scifi/stone/etc) that gives you a plethora of choices for you to modularly snap things together, and create something new and exciting. Kind of like more refined Lego building.

There are minor gripes I have with the game, like how the coaster splines sometimes behave, or if they had more verbose feedback from guests. Giving the designer more information about what affects partk beauty, and how, would also be nice. Some inconsistency issues, like decorations only affecting guest feedback when placed around queue areas. Minor building issues as well. Nothing super major, and things that will hopefully get patched in the near future

Overall, a very fun game for people of all ages, and I would definitely recommend it for anyone who is a fan of the genre, or just being creative in general."

I've been meaning to make a review for this game, but I've just been too busy playing the damn thing than to make time to give it it's well deserved praise! I'd like to give this a proper review so hopefully I don't get too drawn out with it.

TL;DR: Planet Coaster is the Disneyland of Theme Park Simulator games and playing this game gives me the same feeling as watching a fireworks show at the park or even hearing the music being played just as you enter the gates! that feeling of childlike abandon coupled with goosebumps and feelings of nostalgia!

Like many fans of this genre I was introduced to it by Roller Coaster Tycoon, this game had a huge effect on my life that I became obsessed with Theme park design, coupled with the fact that I live nearby various major theme parks fueled my obsession. I've always created parks I wanted to visit or rides of my favorite TV shows/ video games that I hope I could one day ride myself. I've had all past games of Roller Coaster Tycoon and each of them fed my hobby of Theme park building. Then came a game I was so eagerly awaiting to be released(I won't be mentioning any names) it promised limitless possibilities (and grid-less building!) and couldn't wait for it; Then I saw the first trailer, lets just say I was distraught with the result and thought the genre was dead but then came Planet coaster

This game gave me the same feeling as watching the fireworks at Disneyland. from the first trailer onward each news of this game added more potential for that perfect theme park builder/simulator I've always wanted! There's just so much care and detail that has been put into this game, not only that but you can tell that the team that made this game are fans of Theme parks themselves! This was made by the same company that was hired by Disney to make a 1:1 recreation of Disneyland for a video game so of course this game has good Theme Park design under it's belt!

The emphasis on theming you parks is what really drew me in. Sure you can plop down a few Rides and call it a park, but they added a game mechanic that boosts your rides if you take the time to actually theme and decorate your rides for your guests enjoyment. Speaking of the guests, the animation and design of the people really brings the park to life, you can zoom right in with the guests and walk along side them as if your actually there in the park! I remember playing RCT3 and zooming down to the guests view, but I don't feel as if I'm actually there. With Planet coaster those rides really tower over you, and going down one of the hills on a roller coaster feels more real than riding POV in RCT3.

If your a fan of Theme parks this should definetly be in your library."

Given the price drop of the game in the sale I though I'd pop by and recommend this to anyone looking.
It's a fantastic little sim builder, it's an updated rollercoaster tycoon in essence, and it carries with it all the reward and joy the old theme park type games brought.
I'm not a game critic so I can't say much else, but I'd love to see these guys go after the Zoo theme next and see what they do with it, because this game was a fantastic success and I've lost many many hours to it just to see my parks thrive!
EDIT: Just wanna add on though, started playing again after I got the DLC in the sale and I think it needs mentioning just how bad the security features are.
If you can't disable them in a scenario you are just gonna be bombarded with notifications about pickpockets and vandals, and while I handled it perfectly at first, I'm now late game spending about half an hour searching the park for people's thoughts on pickpocketing because despite paying security in gold bars, they don't seem to be able to keep up. Very frustrating."

Planet Coaster is the greatest theme park builder I've seen.

It's still lacking some of the features of the game it's spiritally succeeding (Roller Coaster Tycoon 3), but it's getting frequent updates and they keep adding content. Coaster building is wonderful, and building buildings was fun (but time consuming).

If you just want to get your park running quickly, there are thousands of community made props, rides, and stores for you to plop into your park.

One problem that some people may have is that the buisness side of things is very lacking.

If you are looking for a park builder, this is it."

THE GOOD :
Extremely creative and allow customization beyond your wildest dreams!! For me a game I have been waiting for all my life; You can create the most amazing theme parks in this game, the piece by piece building is really let your imagination and creativity do the trick... And even if you are not creative, you can make the most beautifull parks by using the workshop, So many awesome pieces, shops and rides and of-course lots of challanges to discover, Absolutly a ""must buy"" game for everyone!


THE BAD:
I'm very saddened by the fact that they need to overload this game with DLC. So much stuff are just locked behind the DLC wall, I'd be okay with it if these packs weren't so extremely pricy though. The fact is that the game itself has a base price of 50$. Then all the DLC together is almost another 110$. unacceptable amount of money."
planet+coaster,Recommended,77.6,"Posted: August 21, 2017
This is basically RCT3, but better looking and with nicer scenery. If you liked RCT, you'll probably like this.

PROS:
- It's BEAUTIFUL. No, I'm serious. Even on low settings, it is absolutely stunning.
- Creativity is rewarded in Planet Coaster. Search up such creators as Silvarett, Rudi Rennkamel etc to discover just how amazing your coasters and scenery can look.
- EASY to pick up, HARD to master.
- Very addictive. For reference, I am someone who rarely plays a game to completion. My top most played games are multiplayer/creative games, and this absolutely hits the spot. Each session I play can last almost a whole day if I don't watch out.
- Smooth (at least to me) coasters. Some usage of the smoothing tool, imo will absolutely hit the spot in terms of smoothness. Ofc you could play No Limits if you really want the smoothest, most realistic coasters, but this is perfectly between old school RCT and realism for me.

CONS:
- I get 40-60fps on medium with a 1050Ti, and 20fps with a laptop on low. Still playable, but pretty badly optimised, especially once there are more people in your park.
- NOT THAT MANY COASTERS. If you absolutely NEED to experiments with such things as bobsled coasters and those things with movable tracks, Planet Coaster doesn't have those. It just has fairly normal steel, wooden, hybrid coasters.
- NOT THAT MANY FLAT RIDES. Yes, I know there's like 20 or 30. But they ALL just spin around, albeit at slightly different speeds and intensities.
- MANAGEMENT IS NOT A CHALLENGE. If you like park management, again, not the game for you."

Anyone who liked RCT3, refrain from buying RCTW, I REPEAT, REFRAIN FROM BUYING RCTW. It is not created by the same devoloper and is essentially a half assed attempt to cash out. PC is definitely the true successor to RCT3, and its made by the same developer! By far one of the best games Ive ever played. Not just best theme park game, but one of the best games period that I have ever played. You will not regret purchasing Planet Coaster, I can guarentee it.

Edit:

(The following is a response to comments by Nameless1 and XDeadzX that I fell are important to include in my review)

While I agree that the management aspect of PC is missing a few features in comparison to RCT3, which, in my opinion, had a stock career mode with time wasting capabilities Sid Meier would be proud of, there is the wild card of the Steam Workshop. It is worth noting that RCT3, at least from what I've seen, did not have a particularly strong modding community. That is one reason why I believe that the passion of both Frontier as well as the community built up around PC will soon make up for that lost depth in the career mode, very much in the way Cities: Skylines has drastically improved through the community and developer to rise as the ""king of city builders"", dethroning the dissapointing SimCity in the process.

Now, thats not to say that Frontier slacked on this game whatsoever. Having participated in both the alpha and beta of PC, I came to the conclusion that what PC lacks in career mode depth, it definitely makes up for in the overhauled construction system, sense of freedom to create whatever you want, and overall atmosphere and customizability. The forums during alpha were extremely active, with alpha testers and developers regularly mingling to share ideas and make a game that would shake the very foundation that the RCT brand sits upon. In a way, I see this game as a form of revenge by Frontier to stick it to Atari for not being involved in RCTW.


Anyways, to sum up that cluster♥♥♥♥ of an answer, my conclusion is that, in terms of the base game career mode, RCT3 won by a landslide, despite being a 12 year old game. However, I see PC as having an exponentially higher ceiling than that of its predecessor thanks to the modding community and active developer-consumer collaboration.

That, and challenge mode is essentailly an infinite career mode, where youre constantly given challenges that encourage the growth and development of your park. If the career mode is lacking for you, I definitely recommend giving challenge mode a try."

I am all for DLC but when the DLC starts to cost more than the base game while adding near nothing it makes no sense at all.

The new Ghostbusters DLC (something that carry's a hefty price tag) is in effect advertisement. Why would I pay to be advertised to? I am not a madman nor that much of a brainless fanboy who will buy anything with a logo I like slapped on it.

There is no way to justify DLC that cost 1/3 the price of the game, that adds less than 1/3 the content.

The game is fun (Like RCT1/2/3) but the DLC pricing policy makes this game un-recomendable, I would not support this practice."

Would be a good game if not for all the DLC. A lot of this DLC came out shortly after the game came live. In a game based of aesthetics of your park, this game works hard to cut your creativity behind a paywall that honestly shouldn't exist. Unless they drastically cut the price of the DLC or make it free altogether, I can't recommend this game. Which is a real shame. It looks like it had a lot of potential. I was really hopeful about its release. But as it stands, the devs decided to make content alongside the release of the game and wanted to gouge the consumers. That is absurd. Will be worth if in the future they drop the prices. But until then I can not recommend.

I never played a Roller Coaster Tycoon.

It tooks 30 hours to understand what i was doing wrong and right. The gameplay mechanics are punitive for beginners, you absolutely can't build what you want, where you want, when you want. You need patience, you need to be perseverant, you need to wait eons and be hypnotized by the changes on the profit/loss square of the UI. Making a living is an addiction.

I am not sure if i can totally recommend this game to you. Half of the time you have to resign and start a mission again to fix your mistakes. It's a really long and slow learning curve, sometimes you will understand fast that you are wasting resources on a lost cause, sometimes you will understand it after hours.

This game is VERY fun. It has a LOT of good things going for it, the ability to ""Craft"" coasters of whatever on the fly, and entire theme parks, is a LOT of fun. However there is a massive glaring flaw this game has that i dont see many other people discussing, and im not sure why. A large part of this game is getting people into the park and to expand and make your park better.
THIS DOES NOT FUNCTION
What do I mean? The AI is coded in DX11, it sets all AI to run off a SINGLE CPU CORE - This is absolutely debilitating for a game that your purpose is to get more people in. 2k people? 15fps. This is not joking, even on a VERY strong system the games engine / coding is just screwed because of this. The best thing you can do to keep the FPS up is to fire everyone, and never open the park, just create 1-2 creations and move on to the next coaster.
The devs have stated they will not be fixing this massive flaw, given that I cannot recommend anyone to buy this game, which is a damn shame."

At first, I thought this game would be Roller Coaster Tycoon 4 and because of that I bought it without hesitating.
However, the game has some features that makes it a lot different than expected.

Firstly, the graphics of the game are amazing for the type of game it is. It is very realistic, the Roller Coasters' physics are amazing and so are the ones from the other rides. Everything looks more realistic and believable
Unlike the other Roller Coaster tycoon games, this one offers a huge variaty of possibilities when creating roller coasters, which makes the game a little more professional than the Tycoon series. Is that good or bad? Well, at first it might seem bad because of how hard it is to do everything. It will take a while for the player to get used to the new mechanics and some may give up on the game; that marks the contrast between players that like the game to the ones that don't.
Furthermore, the game offers a significant smaller amount of types of rides that can be put in your park. This is what made me dislike the game at first. However, I am very glad to see that new rides are being added in updates (which are quite frequent).
Also, the new mechanics made it a lot easier to build custom structures, which the older fans may have bad memories about. Now it is much more simple and there are many more options than before. The same thing goes for the terrain. It is a lot easier to shape the terrain and the Ctrl+Z tool was (finally) added, which means no more backup save files of the game.

It should be noted, though, that you must not trust the pictures. You might see some pictures of huge castles or amazing roller coasters and think: 'Man, that's what I want to do.' - It is very hard to do it. Custom structures, as mentioned before, are build piece by piece, which means that building a castle takes a lot of time and hard work, especially for those used to the older games' mechanics. It is easy to understand why people don't like this game, the development team definitely tried something new in this one, something that appeals to a very specific audience.

In summary, it is safe to assume that this game is more 'professional' than before. It is more of a simulator than the fun game you used to play when you were 14. And most importantly, if you want to buy this game just because you think it is the 4th installment of the Roller Coaster Tycoon series, don't do it. You might get disappointed."

This game saved my life.

I am 41.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.
After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you"

So I bought this after having it for a long time in my wishlist.
I've played it for a couple of days now, and I must say I enjoy it, but it is a very frustrating game if you have a playstyle like mine. [Total OCD freak that is a sucker for details and functionality]

So on to the bad stuff first!
(Mind you, I haven't read any of the devs plans for the future, so there might very well be
fixes coming up on some of these... or not. Are Frontier good devs with big ears? :P )

The instant I start up the game I get a news window telling me to buy their DLC. Eff you, is what I think and promptly close it down.
Once in the game I mess about with the decorations and building parts and, again, get told to buy the DLC packs, and I have to spend a couple of minutes figuring out how to turn it off. (Hint: it's next to the filter list)

After a couple hours of playing I open up sandbox mode and decide that I'm gonna make a fairytale/medieval themed park.
I begin to build my custom structures, and quite soon, I notice there are parts missing from the sets... Some sets have a certain angle to their roofs that doesn't match up with another sets walls ect. It would have been lovely if they had just added a couple more pieces to make the sets interchangeable.

Placing foliage is a pain. There is no option to place several in a row (tree brush or similar), there's no option for random rotation or size, and there's no colouring options for the trees either (which I think is a huge missed opportunity.)
You also can't place a lot of trees down by clicking really fast. They just won't place at all. You got to hold down the left button for a short time for anything to be placed down. That goes for both trees and objects.

The pathway tool is just... ugh! I hate the fact that you're limited to a certain width to the path. I wanted to make a town square, and I finally figured out that you can lock onto the grid and place square paths in an area to get that effect. YAY! But why isn't this doable from the start!? Maybe I actually want a round square!?
Nope, says Frontier. You no have no-square square.
I also found out there's no nice, efficient way to place stairs down a slope, without digging a 1 meter ditch underneath it.

And again with color options... I can't save custom colors for the workers, nor for the buildings, nor for the objects. Which means, every time I want an object with a certain color, I need to go and manually change it every time and then painstakingly copy-paste it over and over. Oh, and I have to mention the fact that when you duplicate an object and place it down, it is not automatically renewed so you can place down one after the other.
You got to spam CTRL+D... a lot!

Back to pathways for a short bit... Objects that snap to the path. Why, oh why isn't the light posts also snap-able?

The overall theme I'm sensing with this game is that there is a *lot* of small things with efficiency that add up to a big, fat annoyance-factor.

I haven't even attempted to build a roller coaster yet, (Got stuck building a medieval town *facepalm* )
so can't say anything about that tool, but if it's anything like what I've already experienced, it's going to be frustrating!

Hmm... anything else to complain about? Oh yes!
- The HUD is unacceptably slow at responding. Just pressing ESC to open the options menu takes about .5 seconds.
- When starting up the game there's a Cobra logo that takes ages to go away. (won't respond to any user interference)
- If the object you are trying to place is obstructed, you have this annoying voice shouting at you as if you're about to walk out into oncoming traffic.
- It seems that there is no way to see a detailed list over the maintenance and condition of your rides. I noticed this while trying to make my repairman less bored (giving him more to do).
- Building custom stalls is less fun, when the disk is a huge ugly box. Why wasn't it made into a single disk that you add walls to? I had hoped to make a market with small tents selling various goods. Quite impossible with the way it is now.
- Some textures don't line up the way they should.
- Certain pathway textures aren't usable for queues, and vice versa.
- You can't choose style for the pathway rails.
- No fence-placing tool. Got to place them down, one by one. Just give us ""click n' drag"", pretty please!?

I can't help but compare it to RCT3, and I feel like there was way more management options in that one. I'd rather have too many than too few details and options about my park.

So, what's good about this game?

Despite the huge amount of pet peeves, I do enjoy it.
I love building structures and use them for stalls, or make them a part of the scenery for a ride, and watch the guests reactions.
The graphics are great. Love the voxel terrain editing. I wish there were more terrain textures, but I believe that you can make custom themes in the main menu somehow.
I love the music. Reminds me a lot of Mumford & Sons. The music for the rides are great as well, and you can also add your own music.
Blasting System of a Down to the Merry-Go-Round is a must, right?

Overall, the looks of the game is fantastic. The HUD, though slow in response, has a clean look that I like.
When it comes to park decorations, there's lots of details you can add, like smoke effects, animatronics, water cascades, spotlights ect. and it really spices up your scenery.
The themes are interesting and fun as well. I was pleasantly surprised when I started a pirate themed challenge. Never expected there to be so many things, big and small. Animatronics especially, was fantastic!

I'd definitely recommend this game if you're not a detail-freak like me, and mostly get your stuff from the workshop and just pop them down in your park, no hassle.

I would not recommend it if you are a sucker for micromanaging everything. If there at least was a way to mod the functions in the game... *sigh* The modding community would make the game better a lot faster than I think Frontier would ever manage.

Hoping for improvements in the future."

Planet Coaster has it's ups in downs. While, Planet Coaster is the best amusement park sim that I have ever played, there's a couple things that I do not like.

Pros

Excellent graphics: They really look amazing. Sometimes, you forget you're even playing a game. This is no joke at all.
Tons Of Content: With all DLCs, you get endless content. You'll never run out of stuff that you could build in a park. Let's not forget that there's Steam Workshop content that you can add as well.
Custom Senarios: You can build huge parks. Basically, big until your PC can no longer handle the simulation. Better have a good CPU.
detailed Building: With Customizable terrain, tons of scenery, and mods, you can really get specific with how a park looks. You can even model actual parks.
Realistic Coasters: If you're a coaster enthusiast, you're in for a treat. You can build coasters from most major coaster manufacturers. This is indicated by the track design. You'll recognize the manufacturer as soon as you start building.

Cons

Glitches: Sometimes, when moviung the camera, you can become ""stuck"" on the ground. You need to click on your notifications and click on the button that takes you there in order to get ""unstuck"" Another thing that I have nocticed, when building coasters, when you're clicking on your track to place additional track, the game will think you're clicking on the track behind the one you clicked on. One more thing, the research items feature is very buggy when it comes to researching a shop. It takes several shop researches for things to even show up
One Major Flaw: When the park closes, the time speeds up and the next day begins. The same guests stay all night. This is a major flaw as not only are most of these guests already low on money, if you're basing your park off an entry ticket and free rides like most major parks are in real life, you will not make any money. This is very unrealistic. Guests should automatically be speed up with time while the night ends and leave. Then return the next day.

Fix the glitches and this major flaw and, you WILL have the ultimate park/coaster simulator."

Planet coaster is really fun to play when you just want to do really basic things, but the second you try to do anything advanced, the cracks in the spline system start to show. After playing planet coaster for 200 hours, I have gained a serious admiration for the grid system in the old RCT games. You couldn't do much with a grid, but you could do exactly what you wanted to do without any fiddling around.

Want to create a plaza system with wide open paths? Nope, can't do that. What you can do is randomly place wide path pieces and hope that they will connect in some sort of half decent way. You can try using a grid system but when you connect a grid path to a non grid path, the grid path becomes curved. Have fun with your tiny little gaps between path pieces.

Want to construct a path that runs along a gentle hill? Nope, can't do that. Your hill will look really sloppy from one angle and the path tool will pester you with TERRAIN TOO UNEVEN FOR PATH. You can try using the smooth tool, but it won't help at all. There is no hill tool, you can only push and pull terrain. Unlike in the old games, there is no plopping down a hill and path in a few minutes. Making a hill in PC takes hours, and it will never look right.

Want to create a smooth coaster with elements that feel right and look well? Nope, can't do that. The preset elements can't be manipulated very well, and they often force you to use jarring transitions that don't lead to a smooth ride. You will have to create your own loops and twists, then spam the everloving ♥♥♥♥ out of the ""smooth all"" button until you get something that half resembles a coherent object. Again, this is something that takes way too long to do compared to the older games. Credit where it's due, though. The heatmaps are pretty helpful although some explanation is needed on exactly what causes excitement, fear, and nausea.

What makes these issues all the more aggravating is that there isn't enough content in the base game to justify this trouble. You get a small amount of flat rides, coasters, and scenery, and the rest is locked behind DLC. The icing on the cake is that you can't filter out DLC when you use the workshop. If you don't have the DLC you can't use workshop blueprints that do, so your searches will usually contain blueprints that you can't use. After the career mode ends, you need a lot of imagination to keep playing. Of course, that imagination will never actually match the reality of what you can do ingame, unless you spend dozens of hours fighting the game's systems."

As a coaster enthusiast, this game is amazing to me. This is essentially a RCT rebirth kinda in that it improves upon the original trilogy, as well as the garbage RCTW. There are lots of custom scenery pieces and rides, and with how much stuff is in the base game alone, it's insane. For the coaster aspect of Planet Coaster, I would say its extremely fun to build up crazy coasters that go upwards of 300ft, 400ft, or even higher that would normally not exist in the real world. Speaking of which, this game's coaster selection is based off of real life models, which I think is cool. However, I would like to see even more in the future, maybe like launched or shuttle wooden coaster variants, TOGO Ultra Twisters, or coasters with drop tracks. The coasters featured though already though are amazing, with well known models such as the B&M Hyper, S&S El Loco, RMC I-Box Hybrid, and much more. Of course, this is not No Limits 2, and this is a tycoon game, so you will have to manage your own park empire. The guests are extremely interactive with everything you do in your park, including adding attractions, new sections of park, new shops, scenery, or anything at all that can be interacted with. Now, if you are hardcore into this game like me, I would also grab the DLC, as the base game can feel lacking after you feel like you have done and seen everything there is to offer. If there was one DLC pack I would recommend, I would get the Magnificent Rides Collection just because of how many rides it includes. If you want more scenery to work with, then go with the Studios Pack. Or if you really are dedicated to this game, feel free to get all of them ;p

So, do I recommend this game? Definitely, especially if you are a roller coaster enthusiast. This is easily in my top 10 games ever, and I'm really excited to see what is in store for this game, and the entire Planet series as a whole. Keep up the good work guys!"

This game is a masterpiece if you want creativity. If like me you played Rollercoaster Tycoon 3 for the sandbox alone you will love this game. Any pieces of scenery can be made into something completely different such as a smoking pipe for a snowman can be utilised as a Turnstyle.

I have 80+ hours so far and own the Studios and Adventure DLCs and have not even touched the career mode yet.

Highly reccomend this game if you are looking for creativity especially when the update that allows us to import 3D models comes out."
planet+coaster,Not Recommended,2.0,"Posted: August 24, 2019
I don't mind a little bit of promotion of DLC's (for example in the main menu), but this game really takes it too far with a lot of in-game rides that give a popup that you need the required DLC. Seriously, just let me play the game instead of luring me like this to spend more money on it than I already did.

They first let you think ""cool stuff! I can tinker hours with this"", but right after that they say ""haha **** you, first pay us more money or you will be severely limited in your options. Oh you have found another replacement item you want to use in your theme park? NOPE! FIRST GIVE US MORE MONEY!!!"".

At the very least you should not show all those DLC items and just be honest to your paying customers. I really can't say any good words about these kind of practices. I stopped playing this game after around 2.5 hours because of these stupid popups all the time and unfortunately look back at this purchase with regret. This is sincerely one of my worst purchases of the last couple of years, and that's extra sad since I am a huge fan of tycoon games and was looking forward to finally be able to play this in my vacation."

Should you buy this game?

If you want a 'Minecraft' experience ... ie you have total freedom to build what you want, you can unleash your creativity ... then yes! This is truly a beautiful game. This half of the game, I've absolutely loved.

If you want a 'Simcity' experience ... ie a realistic simulation game, when there is realistic logic behind how guests act, where your decisions determine whether your park thrives or dies ... then no. Sadly the guest logic is very underdeveloped which causes them to act in illogical ways. A current example is say balloon gift shops - if you open one of these shops, every single guest will stampede to this store and they will ignore all your attractions. They will ignore their hunger/thirst needs and prefer to starve in their madness to purchase a balloon. Then there are issues like the complaints about queues (regardless of how long or short they are), how no-one buys priority passes, how adjusting food prices has almost no effect on demand etc.

From the above, you can draw your own conclusion whether the game would suit you.

The reason I ended up with a 'not recommended' rating, is that the game is prominently advertised as 'create' and 'manage' which is what I was after ... but in reality only the 'create' half of the game is complete. Planet Coaster is a disappointment as a park management simulation game.

EDIT: Someone posted a list of the management issues on Reddit. I'm posting the link here if you want to get a good starter list of some of the bigger issues:"

They could have focused more on optimizing their games.
I'm using a Ryzen 9 3900x
A Radeon RX 580 Pulse
And I have 16 gb of ram.
The game hits 60 FPS on medium settings but if there are more than 4000 guests in the park the fps drops down to 20-30FPS unbelievable...
I hope you guys are going to put more effort in optimizing Planet Coaster 2 or just be friendly and patch the game!
And also the game needs more flat rides if possible. There are a lot of rides that I'm missing.
One of my first games that I got from you guys (Frontier) was Roller Coaster Tycoon 3
I spent thousands of hours in Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 and really enjoyed it as a kid. I love this company from the bottom of my heart but now I have to be honest and tell you I’m disappointed and sad that my girlfriend and I had to spend so much money on new computer parts to make the game run well on medium graphics."

I was in the shower washing suds off my girthy chest when suddenly, I heard someone shouting. I immediately drew back the shower curtains and I leaped out, like a frog escaping a pit of boiling, frothing water. Who could be shouting so late, against the indomitable silence of the night? It sounded like it came from my bedroom, where I thought nobody else had entered for years. Something was wrong.
Galvanised to action, I broke down the door and infiltrated my room. I heard the shout again. Only this time, it was clearer, and I understood everything. Cries of ""UNO!"" ruptured my computer speakers. And I was happy.

Ladies and gentlemen, UNO is not a game. UNO is an experience.
UNO is life, yet it is also death. It is the light at the end of the tunnel, yet it is also the darkness. It is the applause at the end of the play, but also the cold rejection of a beautiful woman.
Comrades, those of you reading these reviews to determine whether your hard-earned money should be spent on UNO, you have two simple choices; to buy or not to buy. This is the ultimate test of a man's values - do you believe that the money you have worked hard to earn is equivalent to the potential experience of UNO for Windows?
Some may be hesitant. But to quote poet Robert Frost, ""In three words, I can sum up everything I've learned about life: it goes on"". Whether you buy UNO or not, the worst case scenario is not life-destroying. Life will go on if you spend money on UNO and it is not for you. Yet there is so much that awaits you if you buy UNO and, like millions of others, you find yourself utterly absorbed in the magic of UNO.

I would go further and argue that everyone reading this should buy UNO for Windows. At the time of writing, 30% of reviews are negative. Yet do not be deterred; by finding yourself here, you have demonstrated an interest in this game, and the only way to truly know whether you like a game or not is to play it yourself. Reviews are useful to a point, but in the words of Frank Sinatra, do not be ""one who kneels"" to popular opinion. Do not pretend for an instant that any review here will define your experience of UNO. There will be some who despise it, and others who are utterly enraptured by it. You must find where on this colourful spectrum you fall, and only you can decide that.

I hope that every potential player reading this searches deep into the labyrinths of their heart and soul and finds the answer."

You want a damn review, here's one from two in the damn morning. You got friends right? you let them create the lobby right? Decided to say yes to having them turning on all rules right? It's 11PM, and what's the worse that can happen? That's where your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ up kiddo.

Like ♥♥♥♥ me, there is no winners here, it's just an endless circlejerk of passing cards, and who the ♥♥♥♥ plays the 7-0 rules, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ bastards who want you to stay up late, that's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who. I swear to god, I wanted to end it all. Then the saving grace came in, the friend who started this ♥♥♥♥'s game crashed cause their PC had been running UNO for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ 3 hours straight on one match.

5. When I try to Host a game it tell me I can't because my network settings are set to NAT strict.

nietzsche once said, ""if you gaze long enough into an abyss, the abyss will gaze back into you.""

close friends or complete strangers, the line begins to blur in UNO, where every face begins to look like an enemy's. the temptation of the +4 wild card lures you, the large red SKIP calls out like a siren, and even an inconspicuous green 5 can be the one weapon you need for an indisputable victory. in UNO, any pawn can become a king, and any king can be overthrown - by luck, deceit, or miracle.

where do you draw the line? do you accept defeat gracefully, patiently? do you continue the chain of +2s, hurting those you play co-op with, knowing they have no defenses? do you save your own skin by letting them bleed?

""whoever fights monsters should see to it that in the process he does not become a monster"" - maybe, UNO shows us, the monster is already inherent; maybe we are the monster as much as we are our ability to control it - but when victory is so close, what's one more WILD card? what's one more body left in your wake?

a profound psychological horror especially intensified by the ""rabbids"" dlc (highly recommended). would be enjoyed by girlbosses who would tear down the world to win, and men who related a little too much to joker (2019). 10/10."

I would rather play UNO in person and get COVID-19 than deal with UPlay.

Edit: Since people are actually reading this, I'll expand on why I dislike this version of UNO. Ubisoft has made it infuriating to play this game with friends. Your steam friends list is useless, All of your friends must install and create new UPlay accounts. A few of my friends aren't huge gamers, and guiding them through the install process was not a good experience. Sending and receiving friend requests and game invites is not at all intuitive for someone new to UPlay. There is no easy menu or in game way to create parties. Instead it works through the UPlay overlay which is confusing and hidden behind a weird keyboard shortcut. For many people who want to have a family or friends game night this is just too complicated. I really want to enjoy this version of UNO because the core gameplay is still great, but the amount of work required to get your friends into a game is just too much for anyone not accustomed to PC gaming."

HOW THE HELL DO YOU SCREW UP UNO????????????
IT'S UNO??????"
uno,Not Recommended,14.8,"Posted: December 26, 2018
So this game is tons of fun, I gotta say, it's fantastic to play with a group of friends because, as always, Uno is great fun. The card packs and new rulesets are also fantastic and really change up the pace of the game and make it even more fun, beyond what normal Uno can provide.

That's about all it's got going for it though. The coding of the game itself and the networking are absolutely atrocious. For absolutely no reason, people will drop from games, be incapable of fully loading into games, crash on startup, etc. etc.. Many core features (like calling out Uno) are broken to a degree that makes a potential win into a complete loss. Needless to say, the entire game is pretty much broken somewhere somehow despite the fact that it's literally just Uno. I have no idea how you screw up Uno this badly, but these developers apparently made that a reality. If it was just one or two of these bugs in isolation, I could put up with it, but the quality of this game makes me feel like unpaid interns created it and that it's literally just a project for Ubisoft interns to work on that generates them some cash on the side. There's no care at all for quality put into it, which I mean sure, it can't be that popular of a game and isn't a flagship, but it still flagrantly displays it's made by Ubisoft and is grossly broken. Not that I expect anything else out of Ubisoft, but for god's sake, it's just a damn card game, how do you make it so that just to play an online card game it can take 20 minutes of restarting games just to get it to work, only to then have people just disconnect at the start or mid-game for no reason despite them having no connection issues at all on their end?

The game's a hot pile of trash code cobbled together into something that got tested literally once by the devs before initial release and never fixed since. I know teenagers that could make Uno better than this. Maybe not as good looking, but at least the damn thing would be stable, especially 2 years after release.

I'm still gonna play it, cuz man I love me some Uno with friends, and I can't return it now, but I will for the rest of my life state that Ubisoft doesn't give a damn about their product quality if they can't even make Uno stable."

Uno with friends can be very frustrating, you know whats even more frustrating than the game itself? Trying to even MAKE a lobby with your friends to play the game you just bought.

This game has caused nothing but pain and misery for me and my friends. Games last for almost an hour sometimes, and its filled with pure hatred and regret. Every waking moment I see myself drawing 16 cards before finally getting the color I need, as they all laugh. Some think it is a game. They could not be more wrong. Each time I achieve ""UNO!"" I quake in my boots, knowing that I will get +4'd straight to hell. It is a never-ending cycle of pure pain and misery that only the sweet release of getting destroyed by a Rabbid can break. A simple lighthearted card game turns into the next World War. Does winning matter? Does losing matter for that fact? At this point the only real thing that matters is keeping my sanity as the cards keep piling up. But yeah, overall this is a good game and its pretty fun."

Go ahead and try to find something to criticize about this game.

Maybe graphics scalability? Can you even be offended at that? The game does use polygonal graphics and what appears to be vertex lighting, but I think most integrated graphics chips can handle this amount of detail. Don't quote me on that one. Most systems out there can run this game no problem... If they are Windows systems.

Maybe the friend requirement? Flipping through the manual yourself still provides an interesting experience. The entire game can be beaten with one person or with the participation of 20 or more people. How many games are like that?

Lack of voice chat feature? The game has full Steam support, making this a non-issue.

Lack of netcode? The design of the game makes this irrelevant. You don't even need an internet connection, but to initially download the game.

Frustration? You can pick up or close the game at any time. Learning to play it without griping at others or being discouraged is probably good for your social health. It's far less frustrating or ""cheap"" than many modern games, too: bounding boxes in Dark Souls 2, spawns in flanking in Call of Duty, unreasonable level design in Hotline Miami 2. Bombs are self-contained puzzles and you lose only seconds if you make a mistake, not hours of effort. In fact, the more level-headed you are, the better you will be at the game.

Brevity? This one I could see, but the main collection of bombs is only to introduce the mechanics and give some gimmicky setups in the first place. Once you complete it, you can free play whenever you want, as the design calls for well over 11^11 (that's about 2.9 * 10^11) variations. It's unlikely you will ever play the same bomb twice if your objective is variation.

Cost? It's $15 right now; if you go in with friends it's a drop in the bucket. I don't feel too bad about the development:cost differential, but I suppose that's up to personal preference.

Keep Talking and Nobody explodes is an accessible, inexpensive, tightly designed game. Even if you've never played a party game or don't care for them, this one is a glimmering example. After hours of consideration, the only problem I can think of is that it seems to be Windows-only at the moment. Do you have Windows and some fraction of $15? Do you like fun games that reward skill, intelligence, and cooperation? If you said yes, it's time to buy."

Most of the time writting reviews is quite easy. You point out the strong and bad points of the title, sum everything up and giving a final judgement at the end. Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes doesn't have strong or bad points... It's great game all throughout which makes writting review of it extremely difficult.

Uniqueness of the game doesn't really help either. The concept of trading information between the manual-wielding ""Expert"" and bomb interacting ""Defuser"" with the constant pressure of timed exploding device is as silly, fun, exciting as you could imagine. The constant shouts, the struggle to correctly describe the contents of many different types of bombs and that tension when the timer runs out and there is that one one wire to cut... It's a great, original idea for the game that focuses on good communication, reading comprehenion and quick thinking and analysis. You rarely see something like that on the market and I'm extremely happy that it works like the charm.

As for the game's content, there are is a good variety of different parts from which bombs can be generated and learning to solve those modules in reasonable pace gives tons of satisfaction for both players… without consideration of which one used the manual or was interacting in the bomb. During my playthrough with a friend, we were constantly switching roles while going through the main campaign and we found out that both roles are fun to play as and require a similar amount of engagement. As you will learn all the basic rules, game starts throwing you many different and creative curveballs to catch you off-guard or present an interesting challenge. This in result keeps the game fresh for quite some time.

You can trust me that all of that what I just described works as well in practice as it seems on the paper and with a good friend you will definitely have a blast. Right now we managed to clear most of the Challenging difficulty bombs, going both as Expert and Defuser on the each bomb and it took up around 7 hours so far. There have many tasks still ahead and we aren't playing on giving up just yet.

If you have a friend and a microphone, you really cannot go wrong with this game. I wholehearthly recommend it for all the hijinks and cathartic satisfaction it provided. Just keep talking and have fun blowing up together."

This game is unbelievably fun! I highly recommend playing this.
Grab a friend. Shove the manual in their face, and get to defusing bombs!
Or grab a friend and tell them ""Sit here and defuse the bomb"", while you grab the manual.
Etiher way, you're going to be having fun. ""Just one more bomb, and then we'll switch"".
Or maybe you'll find that you just love being in charge of the manual. In that case, you may never see the actual bomb, because just operating the manual is so much damn fun.

This is the ultimate co-op game. Whichever side of the bomb you're on, it's just so much fun.

Even just watching other people play the game is so much fun.

Concept: 10/10
Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes is an asymmetrical party game for 2 or more players, where one person defuses a bomb, while everyone else tells them what to do. Pretty innovative, yet a natural fit for its genre. Also, you only need one copy of the game for as many players as you want, which gives it great value.

Gameplay: 38/40
The game doesn't waste any time getting to the action. The game feels tense right from the first bomb, even if you end up with plenty of time left. The defuser's job is to tell the experts what kind of wiring and such is on the bomb, and the experts look them up in the manual. The experts then tell the defuser what to do to disarm each module. Usually the game consists of a series of questions and instructions. This might sound boring to some people, but the modules are very well designed to make it fun. They range from simple wires that require going through a list of options until you get to the correct one, to ""who's on first"" modules that require careful enunciation. The modules that are the least interesting also take the least time.
I think most people would progress in skill quickly, but fortunately, so does the game. There are quite a number of scenarios that excellently pace the players through all the mechanics, and each one is procedurally generated. There's also a custom bomb mode that could provide theoretically endless hours. One would think that the game would become repetitive, but it literally takes five minutes, so it never feels grindy. The one thing I could see to improve the game would simply be more modules. But there's certainly enough as it is.

Aesthetic: 20/20
The game isn't the most realistic looking, but it's in that zone and feels super appropriate. Everything looks nice, there's no extraneous clutter, and the sounds are perfectly suited to the atmosphere. The details are nice too; occasionally the lights will turn off for a few seconds, but the lit screens on the bomb stay visible. Great job here.

Length: 9/10
While the game provides a mountain of different possibilities, it does have a limit. That limit won't be reached for a long time, but it's there. It's kind of like a Rubik's cube: once you've mastered it, then you can only refine your skills. But it has like ten times the fun and complexity of a Rubik's cube.

Technical: 20/20
The game runs smoothly. I haven't run into any bugs whatsoever, and the manual is easily available online as a pdf, a webpage, or printed. The controls are tight. Not much to say when there's nothing wrong. :)

Total: 97/100
Keep Talking and Nobody explodes is one of the best games I've picked up this year. It's simple, but that simplicity is one of it's strengths. It's a pure rendition of a great idea, and will surely bring a lot of laughter and yelling."

Don't get me wrong, this game is a TON of fun and it's very heartpounding. I like this game but the only problem I have with this game is that you need people to play with because it's not really fun if you look the answers by yourself.

Basically, if you don't have anyone to play with, it's probably not going to be fun."

This is an awesome puzzle game for two or more people. It will certainly test your friendship or marriage, lol. At first glance, I questioned if there was enough game here to merit the pricetag, but oh boy is there. There are tons of levels, and even a puzzle generator where you can alter various puzzle dynamics. The levels increase in difficulty nicely.

There is a manual that you print out, and you are free to study it as much as you want. One person works with the bomb - they are the only ones that are allowed to see the screen. The other person(s) is using the manual as a tool to help you solve the puzzles on the bomb. It is helpful to play with more than two people - we had an extra person and you could divvy out puzzles to save time. The average time they give you to solve a bomb is 5 minutes.


+Awesome fresh take on a co-op puzzle game
+Puzzles are really well done - it would take a long time to 'memorize' the manual or be an expert at this game
+Lots of room for future DLC (ie. a new manual version, game modes, etc.)
+Controls are minimal and work well


-I am not certain that you could complete every bomb with just two people
-I prefer this in short bursts rather than long play sessions
-People seem to have strong opinions on which role they like playing - for example, I literally refuse to be the expert with the manual. Thankfully my friends want that role, and they refuse to run the computer. That could be a factor."

You enter a dark room,
There is this briefcase in front of you, you can't make out what it is.
The lights turn on. IT'S A BOMB!!
3 minutes on the clock!
7 modules need to be disarmed!
The manual is in the hands of your annoying, incohesive brother who is barely able to read!
You get to the first module with relatively little effort. But the next few modules are more difficult.
The next 4 modules are now also done, but there is now only 45 seconds left and the next 2 require significant help from the manual holder.
Your brother doesn't know what he's looking starts rambling incohesively. You grab him by the shoulders and yell ""SPEAK ENGLISH MAN!!, I NEED A PASSWORD NOW!!!""
With immense difficulty he figures out the password and you disarm the module. But one module remains and there are 20 seconds on the clock! It's simple wires! But your brother now has to quickly navigate from the last page to the first page of the manual on his phone which struggles to load. 10 seconds left!
He finally finds the 6 wired instructions and asks for wire colors, you name them, 5 seconds left!
Before he bothers analyzing he goes on a limb and sais ""FOURTH WIRE!""

Understand first of all, that this is a two player game. Whether the other player is in the room, or across the world makes little difference, but this is not a game you can play by yourself.

This game is brilliantly simple. The idea is simple, the execution is simple, but the result is brilliant. It has never failed or crashed on me, and its tonnes of fun. It works in a lot of situations; playing over VoIP, playing in the same room, or even as a party/drinking game.

At the asking price (non sale) of 15€ its a no-brainer. And the game does indeed live up to it's advertisement, so what you see is what you get. If you like what you see, there's no reason not to buy the game, in my opinion.


This title will also be obvious for a VR remake in a few years, when VR technology is more universally available."

Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes

A little game where you and your friends are disarming bombs.

This is a co-op game that puts you, the player, alone in a room with nothing but a bomb, and sometimes an annoying alarm clock. You must disarm the bomb before the timer on said bomb runs out. How ever, you have no manual. In comes the co-op mechanic as your friends have a manual that they can use to instruct you on how to disarm the bomb. This is a game where your friendships will either solidify, or very likely yourself, blow up to pieces.

The bomb you're given has modules which take the form of various puzzles that you must solve and complete in order to disarm the bomb. You can have up to eleven modules in total that range in difficulty. You will have to trust your partners to decipher the information you're giving them. They must be able to use that information and read what the manual instructs before finally giving you the instructions you need to disarm the bomb before it disarms you.

To conclude, this is an incredibly fun game. Co-Op done absolutely right. It also comes with Oculus Rift support. Pick this game up, you will not be disappointed. If you don't want to disarm the bomb but love giving instructions, the manual is absolutely free to use via the link below."

An awesome multiplayer game. What's cool about it is that only one person needs to buy it so that you can play it (the others look at the manual online). You can play with your friends on Skype, but then only the buyer can defuse the bomb.

You can approach it very seriously, and it becomes a game with a lot of thinking in which you try to find the best strategies to avoid wasting time. You can also decide to approach it more casually, and it becomes a nice game about communication to bring at parties (or to play with less serious friends). In the end, I think it suits all types of players, even people who don't enjoy video games."

For multiple drunk people, nobody can talk unless their holding the ""Talking Spoon"". Go find an object. that is now the talking spoon. Bonus points for physically large objects such as large exercise balls. Regardless of object its still called the Talking Spoon. This rule comes into effect when the group identifys the first drunk.

More than one person is allowed to hold the talking spoon so as long as both are holding it. Putting your hand on some one elses doesn't count, it needs to be on the surface area completely. Anyone breaking this rule gets beaten with the talking spoon.

Public Review on behalf of the Opium Pulses Steam group

Few words about the game
Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes is a game where you're playing the role of the sapper in a closed room, alone with a bomb. Your only hope lies in your friends, who are in possession of the manual how to defuse it. But there's one catch - they're unable to see it, so you better prepare your throat to talk a lot. A lot and quickly!

Advantages
- Awesomely fun concept that will keep you entertained for hours
- Nice, pleasant to the eye, 'soft' graphics
- I've actually learned most of the morse code so I can pretty much say it's educative!








This game is simply amazing! I've had a ton of fun playing it with a few of my friends (as a defuser and a manual crew) and we're still not bored of it, even better - we really want to play more and get better at it! The only thing that kinda slows us down is the fact that after a while of playing, you simply start to remember rules of defusing yourself and it's not a problem for defuser to defuse few modules even without any use of manual - that's why in my opinion it should be changed from time to time, even a little bit. But except that, I have literally nothing to complain about, this game is surprisingly well though out. Difficulty of bombs throughout the levels is nicely aligned, so there's no ""gap"" that would stop people from finishing it. Literally one of the best co-op games I've ever played! It should be perfect for a drinking game with friends at home *wink wink*

Personal score"
keep+talking+and+nobody+explodes,Recommended,11.3,"Posted: October 12, 2015
I will review this from two points of view: As gamer, and as an ESL teacher. At the time of reviewing this I have only 30 minutes played, but my experience with this game goes beyond my own account.

Gamer:
If you're looking for an epic single player dungeon crawler like Skyrim or Witcher, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a guns-blazing experience like CoD or Battlefield, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a slow, calm strategic game for the family like Monopoly, look elsewhere.
What you will find here is a unique experience that other games cannot deliver.
-Communication and trust are key. They are more necessary in this simple game than in any military shooter or other co-op experience that you will find.
-There is also a small bit of strategy that plays into the game; do you tell you friend(s) about the easy modules first, or the hard one? Do you use your own memorized knowlegde of the manual to save some time, or rely on the expert that has the manual in hand?
-A single mistake, even in the early levels, can cause panic. Some of the multi-stage modules will reset to the beginning if you make a mistake. My wife and I played this game together. She had the manual. We had over a minute left. It was a module that requires you to remember numbers and positions. We were on the second to last step, and I made a mistake. We stayed calm and kept going. Step three, she read the wrong instructions. One chance left. Thirty seconds. I'm almost shouting the numbers. Fifteen seconds. She's reading too slow. Last stage. I say the number. Time: five seconds. She starts reading the instructions. I can't... I push the button. An explosion rocks our living room. Moments before we had been calm and collected, and in the final two seconds I panicced and pushed a random button.
-Replayability; Even playing through the same levels with a different friend can be exciting. Once you're tired of that, there's a free play mode that allows you to customize the game to your liking. Make it as hard or easy as you like. Want to give yourself thirty seconds to solve 11 modules with no extra chances if you make a mistake? It's your funeral, but you can.
-Party play; Break this game out during a party or dinner with friends and you'll have an extremely exciting experience.


ESL Teacher (Adult students)
I'm always looking outside the classroom for things that can help improve the learning experience. This game has extremely high potential. Once students have reached an appropriate level of fluency, this game will provide a tense situation in which they will need to work together outside their own language. Considering the bomb manual is in English, translating the instructions back into their native tongue will only slow them down. I will definitely use this in my classroom to provide an interesting alternative to drilling vocabulary.
(Note to devs: If you don't want me to use this in a classroom setting, just let me know.)

Do I recommend this game? Absolutely.

Now excuse me, I need to go learn Morse Code."

This game is amazing...get it!!!

Me defusing and my girlfriend giving the instructions....

I had not seen the instruction book at is point...(my bad)
We had just printed it out and she had literally 10 seconds to glance at it and we were on our first bomb...""how hard can it be???""...I've watched Speed, we will be fine.

I thought I was a bomb disposal expert and our amazing work was all down to me. It was her fault when we exploded and I just kept thinking ""Come on...JUST TELL ME what wire to cut"", ""Thanks a lot, we just blew up....you fool"", etc. etc.

We then swapped and I took a look at the instruction booklet!!! I now feel much shame.

She gave me ""one of those looks"", I said sorry, we exploded a lot. I am slowly beginning to build bridges in our relationship and she is now talking to me again. We might get through this.

10/10 would jeopardise relationship again."

Most of the reviews are terrible meme reviews, or written for people already entrenched in the fandom, so here is an actual one for those that need it:

Hatsune Miku: Project Mega Mix+ is the latest in a series of rhythm games by SEGA and Crypton Future Media which uses vocaloid music created by variety of different people. If you aren't familiar with vocaloid music, it is music that uses the vocaloid vocal synthesizer. In the Hatsune Miku games, the music spans the range of Japanese popular music, but most often falls in the range of what one would expect from an Idol group.

While there is a series, you don't need to worry about purchasing previous games, as there isn't really a story (well, nothing you will be ""spoiled"" of in this game), and, including the DLC, this game has around 250 tracks, which includes basically every track in every previous game, so this is the ""definitive"" one to get as of the end of 2022.

Speaking of the DLC, if this is something that is up your alley, you might as well purchase the ""VIP edition"" since otherwise, purchasing the DLC will cost about as much as the game itself.

As mentioned, there are about 250 tracks with the DLC, with multiple 5 difficulties: easy, normal, hard, extreme, and extra extreme. Every song has a hard and extreme, almost all have a normal difficulty, most have an easy difficulty, and a little under half have an extra extreme difficulty. The rhythm gameplay consists of timing button presses of the 6 primary buttons and their combinations in time when the button moves over to the corresponding button press, while the background plays a music video. The actual video part is sometimes distracting, and people have different opinions about whether this is part of the fun or an annoyance. If you wish to see the video alone without the gameplay, you can also do that.

Overall, I recommend this for people who like rhythm games and J-pop, though there are some headaches that could be avoided with better menu design, including things I clarify below.

Some things that aren't clear that will make your life easier:
1) The ""options"" menu only has a few things in it (mainly the primary video/audio settings), but the ""customize"" area actually has some submenus with more options, like key configuration and setting the timing to match your audio/video delay. It only goes up to 150 ms, which may not be enough for wireless headsets, but you can also adjust extra delay for each song by pausing an adjusting individually.
2) You can go to practice mode or music video mode by selecting a song, and then going left/right before selecting ""start.""
3) You can configure the outfit for each song by pressing X when the song is highlighted, and then configuring there. If you want to go to the ""recommended"" one, you hit left and right trigger at the same time. If you don't change any outfits, you'll always have the default ones and not the recommended ones."

Hatsune Miku has taken over my life. I used to be a huge metalhead. I would play heavy metal on spotify when doing anything. Now I don't even use spotify, yet alone listen to such music. Hatsune Miku has not only single-handedly destroyed my years-long metal phase, she has also changed my life. Truly, a life-changing experience. I recommend forfeiting all mortal possessions and thoughts to Miku. You will be happier person once Miku becomes your life"

So far, solid PC port, seems to be using Independent Flip composition in borderless mode, which is great. One small issue I can point out is that the game lacks a framerate cap option that supports 30FPS (for low-end systems) or high refresh rates (for high-end systems or anyone without a FreeSync monitor). It works fine on the Steam Deck as well. It already blows the arcade release running unofficially out of the water. Please let them know about any issues you're having, and please support this release.

The fact you can pick Future Tone visuals instead of MegaMix is already worth the price of admission.

It's been 3000 years, but we finally have Project DIVA on PC!

EDIT: There are some really nasty audio pauses that happen at times, alongside audio desyncing afterwards. Patch those issues and have a proper FPS uncap option, and this port will be solid.

EDIT 2: Make sure to have your audio sample rate in Windows set to 16-Bit 48KHz, that fixes most of the desyncing issues for me. Pairing that with Special K and a framerate uncap patch to get the latency as low as possible is what I’d advise doing. Any minute now until the Steam moderators community ban me for this review, because I dared to mention a mod that genuinely helps out with a bunch of bad PC game releases as of late."

I am a 52 year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my son, who is now 18. My son recently downloaded Hatsune Miku: Project Diva Mega Mix+, and in less than a week he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, did the tutorial but I was stuck on what you were supposed to do. I asked my son for help and he recommended me a song to play. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories."

Yes, finally we have an official Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA game on PC!

Since I'm a rythym game and also anime fan, I immediately fell in love with this game. I only played with the PSP titles in PPSSPP with a PlayStation 4 Controller, and that was easy compared to this one. This one is harder and more complicated, which I don't really mind, I love challenges you know. Since I never had a PlayStation 3 or 4 so I've never played the other games in the series, so I'm just literally experiencing the whole game, how it works etc. This is going to be an interesting and a very long ride! >_<

I saw a few people complaining about the performance because of Denuvo and honestly, I did not experienced any of that. I'm rocking a really old PC (i7-3770 + 16GB DDR3 + R9 Nano) and it holds a stable 60FPS at max settings, no input lag, nothing. So I don't really have any issues so far and I hope that this does not change in the future.

If you’re as crazy as I am, you’ll buy the VIP Edition instead of the base game!"

Dominos App feat. 初音ミク

Hello Everyone, I’m Scott, President of Domino’s Pizza! Have you heard of Hatsune Miku? Today I'd like to announce a new collaborative project featuring Hatsune Miku: Domino's App featuring Hatsune Miku! Hatsune Miku exists in a software called Vocaloid. Vocaloid enables you to produce songs. A character named Hatsune Miku sings the songs you create. A great feature is you can create songs as you like. I knew our talented Domino's Pizza crew could work together and create great Vocaloid songs. Bokolo P, Esshi, Chokyoshi, Futitsukeshi, everyone! Amazing Vocaloid songs have been created with the fantastic imagination of the crews from all over Japan! The challenge was successfully carried out; and this new collaborative app was produced. ＤＯＭＩＮＯＳ ＰＩＺＡＡᵃ ᵃ ᵃ Based on Miku's image, the Domino's app changes its appearance a lot of music and illustrations produced by Domino's crew are here. From the menu to the order just like Miku. Once your pizza is delivered, have some fun with Miku! it comes with a social camera function and you can take various poses, pictures of Miku. Very cool! And last, but not least, the live performance! Start the pizza stage live and point the camera towards the pizza box and the pizza box will turn into a live dancing venue. A live performance of Luv4Night produced by Domino's crew! Here we go!"

I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked a song and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he taught me how to play. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

Many years ago, I was browsing the PSN on my PS3 and saw a rhythm game demo with some anime girl in it. I liked Guitar Hero and Elite Beat Agents, so why not try this?

At first, I'm like what is the high pitched squeaky weeb nonsense? But after replaying the same demo all night long, I realized I had to hit the buy button on Amazon for my first copy of Project Diva F.

That started a many year affair with PS3, PSP, PSvita, PS4, and Switch games; soundtracks, figures, concerts and a trip to Hokkaido even.

Now, finally, Project Diva lands on PC .

The game is capped at 60 FPS, but I have no issues playing in windowed borderless mode at 1440p on my i7 6700k, RTX 2080 build. Nothing seems out of line, plenty of settings similar to the console releases, with a few graphics options sprinkled in. I do not see this as a demanding title performance-wise.

I am using a wireless Xbox One pad and have no issues so far. I am not very good at these games, but find no glaring latency issues, but YMMV.

I strongly recommend the VIP version since it has the most content of any of the releases, perhaps save Future Tone, at release for $60. If you're going to go in, go big. Just realize that the Item Unlock key is included. For returning fans of the series who want to skip straight to Extra Hard, they're likely to download this. But for new players who want some progression, I recommend disabling it in the games properties within your library such that you can work you way up the difficulties while unlocking outfits.

Just one hour in, I strongly recommend this game. But be cautious, as you might delve down a dark rabbit hole and find yourself buying LED glow sticks and nendoroids."

IMPORTANT EDIT: Update 1.01 does NOTHING to fix the random lag spikes that occur during songs, so my review will stay as a negative for now.
Come on SEGA, get it together.


I hate that I have to write a negative review, but I have to voice my frustration.

My PC is well beyond the specs needed to play a game like this, (My PC has no trouble running Witcher 3 at near max settings) but this game stutters and lags on nearly every single song to the point where sometimes it causes me to completely fail that song, due to the fact the game freezes and makes it so I can't input anything for up to 3 seconds.

I have a feeling the culprit is Denuvo. So until the time the game is patched to fix this issue, or even if some saint mods the game to fix this issue, I have to give this release a negative review.

The game is FANTASTIC, don't get me wrong. I have been playing Project Diva since the PS3 era, and it is a top tier rhythm game, so I really hope SEGA fixes this.

EDIT: After playing for a bit more, I have noticed that the lag spikes also occur in the menus themselves, and not just during gameplay. Also, the lags I experience in the menus last seemingly the same amount of time and occur at the same regularity as the lags during gameplay.

EDIT 2: Seemingly, putting my PC into airplane mode removes the lag spikes completely. I was able to play issue free for about 2 hours."
hatsune+miku+project+diva+mega+mix,Not Recommended,1.1,"Posted: July 2, 2022
Due to the use of Denuvo, Mega Mix+ has mild stuttering mid song, about 1 single second 2-3 times per song. If the game was another genre, it would be bearable. However, this is a rhythm game. Every second counts, and there's no way to get perfect chains or clear hard difficulty songs due to this. The workaround of disconnecting the internet can cause score/progress loss or sometimes not work fully, so I guess maybe I'll just get this on the Switch instead."

While the adjustments to the game itself (switching between Mega Mix and Future Tone visual styles, etc.) are worth the price of admission, out of the box the game is borderline unplayable. My PC is way beyond the recommended requirements, but even in Mega Mix mode there are bizarre stutters and lag that are utterly unacceptable in a rhythm game. I spent more than half of the time I was playing messing around with the visual settings hoping to fix the issue, but even at the lowest, it doesn't make a difference.

For example: 39! music's PV lags severely at any setting, but only during the shots that are zoomed in on Miku. 2D Dream Fever lags slightly throughout the entire song. Good luck even attempting to play Senbonzakura, because the lag is so severe it's just unplayable. It's maybe not as noticeable on lower difficulties, but playing Hard or Extreme charts is almost impossible.

It's frustrating, because Project Diva being on PC is monumental, but if it's unplayable, what's the point?

Edit: Due to fixes implemented in Special K, the game stutters and lag are gone for me. I'm leaving the rating the same because until Sega fixes the issues themselves, I can't recommend buying this unless you're willing to use another piece of software to run it. The lagging stems from Sega's frame limiter being incorrectly implemented, and the stutters are due to the network code. I'm not going to recommend anyone buy a bad port, because unfortunately that's what this is right now."
hatsune+miku+project+diva+mega+mix,Not Recommended,297.7,"Posted: April 4
I wish reviews were based on star ratings or a 1/10 scale, rather than ""Recommended""/""Not Recommended"", because it forces you to frame games as being excellent or trash, and makes it difficult to grab reader's attention when discussing pros and cons. I'd rate this 7/10. I've played for *250+ hours now,and own all of the DLC, so I obviously don't hate this game. I do, however, have a massive bone to pick with the devs for not addressing what is evidently a widespread and aggravating issue. So I'm going to start with that.

~My Issues~

-1. The stutter. I have tried every solution put forward by the community on Steam, as well as solutions suggested on other forums, to absolutely no avail. There's minor consistent stutter throughout most tracks. And then there's the gamebreaking stutter. I can get halfway through a track, and the audio+visuals will suddenly slow to a near stop, only to jump back up to speed seconds later. Even if you know the oncoming button combinations and try to push through, it won't matter - the stutter also seems to cause the game to fail to register any input whatsoever. And given the nature of a rhythm game, this often breaks your score. I've noticed it happens approximately every 10-15 minutes; and for clarity, this is occurring on a laptop exclusively designed and catered to gaming (that runs AAA games on high graphics with 0 issues), with no other software running in the background during these instances. In other words, my device specs (and my settings) are not likely components in this issue.

I've come to the same conclusion many others have, and that would be that Denuvo, the anti-cheat system, is likely responsible. Denuvo has been implicated in poor game performance for a variety of games from what I've read online, and stuttering in games has repeatedly been attributed to it. I've been patiently playing through the stuttering issue for months, but after having encountered it 4 times in an hour practicing objectively difficult and fast tracks, tweaking computer settings to no avail, and just generally ending up frustrated instead of relaxing as intended- I no longer have the patience for it. It becomes less fun and more... Upsetting when you're about to score a Perfect on, say, Bring It On, just for it to stutter at a crucial button-spamming moment.

-2. This game isn't disability-friendly.

I know this aspect is irrelevant to many folks, so scroll past to the pros of the game if this isn't relevant to you. As someone with a genetic disorder, resulting arthritis, and audio/visual processing disorders, there are accessibility settings regarding everything from font/color/symbols/the actual gameplay (some of which double as challenge settings) they could offer that are seemingly unavailable/weren't considered. Additionally, not all tracks were balanced properly; ex. Miku's voice may come off muted compared to the music, or the reverse in some tracks, which makes interpreting the track difficult. You can injure tendons playing certain tracks (looking at you, Jigsaw Puzzle), and the button icons on the screen blend into numerous track backgrounds, meaning learning the tracks the first time around with any kind of visual impairment is tedious.

At this point, I've achieved dozens of Perfect scores on tracks like Teo, Gaikotsu Gakudan no Riria, etc. on Hard/Extreme/Ex Extreme, so please don't write this off as ""get good"", because I'm not terrible at rhythm games lol. I'm just pointing out that not everyone plays these competitively, and I had to work twice as hard to pass tracks I'm sure able-bodied players had significantly less trouble with. For me, the enjoyment is mostly in being able to move my body in a generally safe way in sync to good music. If Atlus' Persona Dancing series was capable of adding more than 2 dozen modifiers for added accessibility, or conversely, challenge, Sega was more than capable of giving such settings consideration when porting this game. If their concern was that it would unbalance the playing field, they could have factored in negative score modifiers based on the used settings, or disabled achievements/presentation on leaderboards.


-------------------------------------------------------------
Anyway, I've gotten my whining out of the way. Now for...

~Things I Like~

-1. The track selection is honestly quite decent.

Games like this sometimes get bloated by subpar music that makes you avoid playing through the tracks - there are certainly a few songs I'm not a fan of, but it's not off-putting. My favorite's list is up to ~100 songs, and this game has encouraged me to purchase several tracks/albums online to listen to. I'm obsessed with Reol and Wowaka's work. I'll also add that some tracks actually have been retuned/clarified from their original releases, and were generally more pleasant to listen to.

-2. An excellently commitment-free pastime that offers increasing degrees of challenge. A never-ending source of entertainment.

Some rhythm games force you to play through poorly written Story Modes or minigames in order to unlock tracks, difficulty settings, or costumes. As opposed to just letting you jump into the actual rhythm game. It makes you feel like you're working just to play the game for the main purpose you bought it for. Project Diva Mega Mix+ doesn't torture you that way. You jump right into it following the tutorial, and you can walk away from it and come back to it without feeling like you're doing chores in order to enjoy it.

Missing accessibility settings aside... The first 2 difficulty settings are laughably chill. The jump to Hard is where they introduce the majority of the button combinations, and Extreme is where it starts forcing you to mash and alternate between those combinations constantly. I personally love the challenge, because you can tangibly track your progression as you go from ""Surely that's not possible...?"" to ""Ayyy I just did that somehow??? How do I have fingers still???"" (See: How it feels to progress on Sadistic Music Factory.) So, whenever I start a new track and encounter a ridiculous wave of combinations, I spend... Unhealthy amounts of time learning them. It's just pure fun, and very satisfying.

-3. The modules are creative, and generally fun to toy around with.

Ah, yes. Kaito. In a jumpsuit. With a tail. Demonic horns. And sunglasses. This makes perfect sense while dancing to a love song. The pinnacle of gaming, truly.

(If you can't laugh at the ridiculous things the Vocaloids are dancing in, what's the point?)


----------------------------------------------------------------------
TL;DR:
Notorious stutter issue that impacts performance somewhat overwhelms the otherwise decent quality of this game, and it has not been addressed formally. Accessibility features are largely missing, and button mapping is somewhat annoying. However, the available tracks are enjoyable, the game doesn't leverage tracks by forcing you to play through a Story Mode or otherwise do things that aren't strictly rhythm-gameplay, and the range of difficulty settings makes it perfect for people who enjoy continuous challenges."

Hello everyone, I’m Scott, President of Dominos Pizza. Have you heard of Hatsune Miku? Today I would like to announce a new collaborative project featuring Hatsune Miku: Dominos App Featuring Hatsune Miku. Hatsune Miku exists in a software called Vocaloid. Vocaloid enables you to produce songs. A character named Hatsune Miku sings the songs you create. A great feature is you can create songs as you like. I knew our talented Dominos Pizza crew could work together and create great vocaloid songs. Bokaro-p, E-shi, Choukyou-shi, Furitsuke-shi, everyone! Amazing vocaloid songs have been created with the fantastic imagination of the crews from all over Japan. The challenge was successfully carried out, and this new collaborative app was produced. Based on Miku’s image, the Dominos app changes its appearance. A lot of music and illustrations produced by Dominos crew are here. From the menu to the order, it looks very cute: just like Miku. Once your pizza’s delivered, have some fun with Miku! It comes with a social camera function, and you can take various poses, pictures of Miku: Very cool. And last, but not least, the live performance! Start the pizza stage live and point the camera towards the pizza box, and the pizza box will turn into a live dancing venue. A live performance of Love for Night produced by Dominos crew! Here we go! Miku sings Let’s enjoy the rest of the performance, with the app!"

Excellent game series, absolutely one of the best rhythm games available today.

However, there's one major flaw with this port- and that's the use of Denuvo. The first night I played this game it was fine and I experienced no lagging. Every time I've tried to play after that the songs randomly stutter in the middle and go off sync, sometimes the game goes so off sync that it's close to a second off. It's absolutely impossible to play this game in it's current state due to Denuvo causing lag and stuttering issues. I am not eligible to return this game anymore but if I was I would absolutely return it, because as I said above it's impossible to play."

TL;DR: For a rhythm game that demands precision, I have faced unacceptable stuttering issues that are not present on PS4 and Nintendo Switch editions of this game, possibly due to Denuvo DRM. Additionally, the game is locked to 60FPS. I would still suggest giving the game a try (just remember to stay under 2 hours in case you need a refund), because if the stuttering issues are not present for you, Project Diva is a fantastic game.

As a huge fan of Vocaloid and the Project Diva series, this title is a huge disappointment due to its technical issues.
When playing a game as precise as Project Diva, even the most momentary of stutters can ruin a run. In my experience, the stuttering of this game is unacceptable considering that the same (or nearly the same) game runs flawlessly on PS4 and even Nintendo Switch hardware.

Let's talk about the good for just a moment: Project Diva is an absolutely wonderful game to play. It is accessible to a wide variety of players and offers immense challenge for those who seek out higher difficulty levels. I strongly suggest trying the game for yourself and seeing whether or not the stuttering affects you, because if it doesn't, you're in for a treat.
But as a mid/high-level player, the stuttering issues make the game entirely unplayable, and absolutely demanded a refund.

And it's not due to hardware limitations. According to task manager, I am not even utilizing 30% of my CPU, GPU, or RAM-- and I should hope I'm not, considering this game exists on Nintendo Switch and I am playing with a Ryzen 7 5800H, RTX 3050 Ti (mobile variant), and a whole 32GB of DDR4 RAM. Even on the lowest graphics settings, these issues exist. And even on a good run with no large stutters, the experience is simply nowhere NEAR as smooth as it is on Playstation or Switch.

Why? It's impossible to be sure. However, two facts are known. First, this game uses Denuvo DRM. Secondly, Denuvo DRM is known among the gaming community to cause massive performance issues to games all across the industry. I won't say for certain that it's the cause of the problem, but you do the math.

To top it all off, the game appears to be LOCKED to 60 frames per second. Yes, a PC rhythm game, where every frame genuinely does count, is unable to run faster than 60FPS. Unacceptable.

In summary... dammit, Sega. I was so excited for a PC port of Project Diva. I snatched it up as soon as it went on sale. But the bigger the fan, the bigger the disappointment. Guess I'll be sticking to console for now."

For anyone new to the Project Diva series, this game is NOT a new original entry, it's more like a big compilation. This game is pretty much just a PC port of Project Diva Mega Mix on the Nintendo Switch. Which itself was also just a port of Project Diva Arcade/Future Tone with a toon shader attached. Aside for some very few exceptions, don't expect to see new songs, MVs, or modules that you haven't seen in the previous games. So know what you're buying with this.

Gameplay wise, this game plays like the Arcade game. It has a VERY steep learning curve and nearly impossible to beat on high difficulties if you don't learn to assign button combinations early. While I think the series' gameplay peaked during the PS3 games era, this type gameplay is still very fun once you get used to it. The high skill ceiling also adds more play hours I guess. Some song charts are better than others, but none of them I found to be bad. Fortunately, I didn't encounter any stuttering or lag in my 100 hours of playing.

The main selling point this game has is the extensive song list and the option to turn the toon shader OFF. No offense to anyone who likes it but it's just too bright and undetailed for my liking. But for some reason not every song has the option to turn it off. And even worse, sometimes it SEEMS like the song is playable without the shader on, but then midway it turns back on for some segments like in the song Suki Kirai. It's really annoying and I don't see the reason on why they couldn't just turn it off for every song other than pure lazyness.

It's also important to note that this game doesn't specify in the menu that some MVs are made by fans using edit mode in the early games. That's not a bad thing, but it must looks somewhat jarring to new players that some videos have the characters do janky movements with stiff camera angles due to limitations the creators had using edit mode. Although some MVs aren't even animated in game, just playing the music video taken from the original song. Again, lazy lazy Sega.

So basically, if you're looking for a new fresh next gen Project Diva entry, this ain't it. But if you just want the convenience of being able to play a massive (if you get the VIP edition) library of Vocaloid songs with pretty challenging gameplay, I do recommend this game. So long as you can look past its inconsistencies."

Let's be real, this is a reskin of Two-Point Hospital with a college theme instead of a medical theme. I'm not saying that's a bad thing, I'm just saying temper your expectations. If what you want is ""more Two-Point"" this is a fun and interesting expansion of the concept. If what you are looking for is a revolution with all new mechanics and a whole new paradigm, you'll be setting yourself up for disappointment. There's some small quality of life changes, like being able to alter the building shapes a little, you can decorate outside not just inside and it's even more laid back than TPH with a fairly fixed schedule of classes instead of the ""emergency"" pacing that Hospital attempted, but you're basically comparing two kinds of apple, not an entirely new kind of fruit.

If you're new to the series, get whichever theme suits your mood first. If you're a veteran you'll slip right back into your room building habits. Be aware however that at launch your decorations are fairly limited, just like Hospital was. If you haven't exhausted Hospital, you might want to stick with it for a bit longer; the expansions and updates have added far more room decorations than what campus currently has at launch.

Regardless, this is just as fun as Two-Point Hospital was but with an all new spin on humorous classes for your students to take instead of patients to save. The radio DJ and announcers all return with the same style and a few new jokes. The music is a few new tracks, and the only knock is that currently you can't add your own custom music, but it might be something they add later like TPH has.

You can expect the next year or two to include numerous DLC releases with more decorations; so if you would rather wait and buy them in a bundle I wouldn't hold it against you, the game will only continue to improve as they have a history of supporting their games post launch with updates. I personally didn't buy into Two-Point Hospital until it was discounted and it was a much better value to wait:

But then again I enjoyed it enough to buy into Campus at launch with no regrets, I'm only an hour into this and I expect I'll get a couple hundred hours out of it.

EDIT: (12 hours later) Launch day bugs have been minimal for me and nothing game breaking. What few bugs I've seen posted from other people (that didn't effect me) are getting active responses from developers, so overall a fairly reasonable launch IMO.
---

Bottom line: Two-Point (as a franchise) is a very casual management sim with a humorous spin and a laid back style.

""We're sorry for the litter that YOU dropped on OUR-- oh wait, that's mine""

I don't normally review games on Steam, but Two Point Campus is worthy of an exception. If you played Two Point Hospital and enjoyed it, but eventually lost interest because the monotony of the game play set in, then this game is 100% for you.

This reason I'm writing this is solely to highlight how Two Point has looked critically at Hospital and reworked things to fix a lot of the gameplay weaknesses in Campus. Some of the noteable ones:

You are encouraged and rewarded for adding a variety of items to rooms. Gone are the days of certificate spam.
Because you're encouraged to add lots of things, it also makes sense to make rooms bigger than their minimum required size.





That said, I only have a couple gripes:




Developers that actually take the time to learn and improve things deserve my money. Maybe your's, if that's something you also appreciate."

When compared to Two Point Hospital, Two Point Campus is a more relaxing game, which I personally like.
The fact that you get an indefinite summer break before each academic year is a nice change from
Two Point Hospital, where you would get a constant flow of patients right from the start.

Staff training is also much better now in my opinion. Unlike Two Point Hospital, campus employees use a training machine (which eliminates the need to constantly hire/assign trainers) and they do it automatically in their own free time, so it doesn't disrupt your operations. Also, instead of having to wait for staff to be promoted to unlock another training slot, staff can now be trained anytime. All of this makes training much less frustrating than TPH's system.

The base game has 12 different levels/universities, which you gradually unlock. Each university usually
introduces a new game mechanic, except for the last level, which gives you a large plot of land to
create your own university using knowledge from the previous levels. Although some levels were
slightly annoying, the overall variety was quite nice and I personally found it fun to get 3 stars on every university. The game also has a sandbox mode, where you can choose any map you want and customise its rules to your liking.

Building has also been improved. Instead of having to fit rooms into prebuilt layouts, you can now construct buildings in any shape you want. The exterior can also be decorated with paths, plants and outdoor furniture. You can also customize wallpapers and floors like in Two Point Hospital. However, newly built rooms always have the default wallpaper and floor, meaning you have to change it everytime you expand your campus. I got used to it, but it is a bit annoying.

The overall feel is similar to Two Point Hospital. The visuals are pretty much identical, and the in-game world is as humorous as before. Ricky Hawthorn, Harrison Wolff and Nigel B are back on the radio along with newcomers, who offer commentary on university life in Two Point County. The soundtrack is quite nice, but I personally find a bit inferior to Two Point Hospital's OST. It is still pleasant, but it feels less varied.

If you enjoyed building hospitals in the previous game, then you will probably have fun creating universities in Two Point Campus. Just keep in mind that it is less challenging and more relaxed, which might put some people off."

tl;dr: A fun and funny sim game that exceeds its predecessor in almost all ways, though not without its own unique set of rough edges.

Two Point Campus (2022) is the sophomore release from Two Point Studios, following up their 2018 Theme Hospital spiritual successor, Two Point Hospital. Taking inspiration from isometric sim games of yore but this time adding a twist on it instead of mostly just reimplementing Theme Hospital, Two Point Campus is a fun romp that fixes a lot of the issues with TPH, while remaining bogged down by others.

In Two Point Campus, you take the role as a campus administrator, responsible for hiring and firing staff and faculty, building rooms and buildings, and accepting students. The game is broken up into years, each of which takes about 20 minutes of real time, during which students will go from class to class, increasing their grades while spending time between classes to take care of their needs. This is a big difference compared to Two Point Hospital - in TPH, every patient entering your hospital started a timer to cure them before their health meter hit zero and they kicked the bucket (or were otherwise distressed enough to leave, but most of the time death was the major clock). This had a counterintuitive effect on the game - the menus were filled to the brim with all sorts of cute and fun items to please your patients, few of which you actually wanted to use because patients getting distracted just meant the gentle embrace of death grew that much nearer. TPC, on the other hand, has you stuck with your students for multiple years, and you need to keep them happy enough that they don't drop out, and smart enough that they don't flunk out in order to keep that sweet, sweet tuition and dorm rent money flowing. So while it was okay to let your patients starve in TPH, in TPC that's a quick way to get a bunch of depressed teenagers dropping out. Additionally, students also have their own personal goals they want to see while at college - something like seeing a concert, or getting into a relationship, or just looking at a nice hedge shaped like a duck, so you'll be placing all sorts of fun flavor items around the campus to satisfy those whims. Overall, a good change and it really helps make your campus feel like a campus!

Another good change from its predecessor is the way TPC handles rooms. In TPH, you needed to build rooms to complete actions, usually either diagnosis or treatment. In place of those categories, TPC has courses which each use one or more different kinds of rooms. A student in the Money Wrangling program has classes in a Lecture Hall and a Computer Lab, but a student in the Musicality program has classes in a Lecture Hall, Computer Lab, and a Recording Studio. Each course has its own requirements, and savvy players may even provide courses whose rooms complement each other, helping avoid unnecessary extra construction. However, students don't just need a room - they also need that room to have certain objects within, usually requiring bigger and more expensive items in later courses. While your first-year Scientography students will be fine with just a Science Hub, your third-years will need the large and expensive Microscope or Thunder Balls in the classroom in order to keep their grades up. In TPH, you almost never wanted to make a room bigger than the absolute bare minimum size allowed, with only a few limited exceptions for rooms that could operate in parallel off a single room - things like a bathroom where more stalls means more throughput, or adding beds to a trauma ward. In TPC, while you might be able to get away with a min-size room for your first year or two, you'll all but need to make those rooms bigger to accommodate those extra required objects. Which is great! It helps to add a lot of variety to your campuses, since I found that I was often upgrading my existing rooms instead of making a one-size fits all template and plopping that down to replace the original. Upgrading rooms is helped a lot by the new addition of being able to build your own buildings and resize your existing ones, too - though I would argue that, although it's undeniably super convenient, it's also kind of overpowered, since it completely short-circuits one of the fun parts of TPH's room layouts, which was puzzling out how to lay out your rooms. In TPC, you never need to, since you can just knock down a wall to fit a new extra meters of classroom. TPC also brought back the Prestige system from TPH, where rooms gain levels based on how much stuff is in them. Arguably, it's even more important now - higher prestige rooms make students happier and learn better, which is why it's a shame that it's such a pain in the ass now. TPH had a degenerate strategy whereby you could just spam hundreds of a single small, high-prestige item to pump up your prestige rating. TPC addresses this by... adding severe diminishing returns on items you add multiples of. Which is smart, at first, but realistically that means to hit the high level requirements students often want, you'll be plastering the walls of your rooms with dozens of different posters, which is a complete thematic miss and is also a usability disaster, to boot.

There are plenty of other changes, too; some better, some worse. Training doesn't have you flying in experts, or having your staff teach a class of your colleagues anymore - they just sit in a training pod until they level up. Worse, each staff member has three skill slots, each of which have ten levels - AND skills no longer increase just from being used! In TPH, your doctors would improve as they worked; in TPC, your staff is just as good as they were the day you hired them if you don't train them. Classes are not super well balanced - I often found myself taking the same 2-3 courses in levels, since they had high tuition fees, relatively small rooms, and brought in students that had helpful passive abilities. And this is never told to you in-game, but some classes can actively cause problems for you in the form of campus invasions (TPC's equivalent of TPH's ghosts, whereby your janitors need a special skill in order to remove the ruffians before they cause too much chaos) or other maluses. The campaign has some good variety, and unlike TPH I felt like the 3 star requirements didn't really outstay their welcome, with the worst goals usually just being 'graduate so many students with this grade or better,' which isn't really too burdensome if you've been running a good campus. There are a few levels with gimmicks, sort of like Duckworth-upon-Bilge in TPH, and while most people didn't like DuB's gimmick, I really liked it, as I also do the gimmicks in TPC.

There's also some DLC, which I didn't play, just like how I didn't play the DLC for TPH. Maybe if it goes on sale, I'll pick it up.

Overall, Two Point Campus is a great improvement to the formula that Two Point Hospital pioneered. It took me about fifty hours overall to 100% the base game, which is coincidentally almost exactly as long as it took me to 100% Two Point Hospital too. If you're looking for an excellently-made sim game, or an evolution on the fun-but-flawed TPH formula, Two Point Campus is a great choice."

There just... isn't that much of a game to it. All the different types of students work in the exact same way, so every level plays the same: waiting for enough money to expand and build the (functionally) same exact rooms.

It's a shame. I love the style, I love this genre, and I like this development studio. There's clearly been a lot of work and love put into this. Still, I fully recommend playing Two Point Hospital instead."

Quite disappointed.
I really loved Two Point Hospital and I thought this would be as enjoyable but the gameplay is less interesting than Hospital.
It kinda feels that the game plays by itself and you won't make a real difference. You're just a witness of a computer having fun with himself :-D

You get a fixed number of students per year and per course level. You can have several different course on the same year if you want to or one course at high level (more students for this course).
The students don't really own a bed, they share it and only use them when they feel tired.
And, you have to build a lecture room and a specific room related to the course. or maybe a second type for the 2nd year and 3rd year.
The planning of all this is automatically built by the game.
Add a library for all courses so that student can improve their marks and that is all.
Rince, repeat.

The animations are not really funny compared to the fun and creativity of the Hospital game.
A lot of asset reused which I don't mind.
The staff is anecdotical, as you need 2 teachers for many students.
But you need a lot of assistants and janitors.

Research is unlocked only after the third stage.

Most of the time, you'll receive a request from a student ""I want a bench to make-out with people, can you do that"" ?
Ok, placing a bench. Anyone needs anything else ?

There was a sense of efficiency and a bit of pressure in Two Point Hospital that is entirely lost here, no difficulty.
Not even sure how useful it is to increase the level of the students as they all pass anyway all years without perfect professors and upgraded rooms. So I'm not seeing the point.

Not bad, just not engaging. It's much more fun to get a DLC from two point hospital than this new game actually."

If you played Two Point Hospital:

A lot of the same ideas from TPH work in this game too, but notably while in TPH you wanted to get patients through the system as fast as possible, in TPC you're stuck with your students for three years, so things that distracted your patients from getting to where they needed to be in TPH are actually nice to have in TPC.

In TPH you wanted the smallest rooms possible; in TPC some rooms have a variable capacity based on size, so you'll want bigger rooms than the minimum for things like your student union or your library.

Some things are still bad, though, like plants that require maintenance (though students can help with that in TPC), or marketing, which was okay in TPH but is barely useful in TPC.

General:

Always make sure you have at least a couple hundred kudosh in reserve; you get notifications for students wanting things to be placed all the time, and if you unlock those objects willy-nilly you'll end up short when a student needs you to unlock and place an object that's necessary for their coursework.

Being outside improves student health, so try to put as much stuff between buildings as possible, like clubs or food stands.

Classrooms can only handle multiples of 8 students at a time, so be sure to only admit students each year in multiples of 8. Otherwise you'll be hiring extra staff and building extra classrooms for almost-empty classes.

Similarly, crank the tuition fees as high as you can while still being able to take 8/16/24 students to maximize revenue - the happiness penalty isn't very severe.

Students pay tuition, but they also pay rent, and the nicer the dorms, the higher the rent, so be sure to crank your dorms' prestige level as high as you can. It's easier and cheaper to have one big dorm than a bunch of small ones as a result.

Every course has classes in lecture halls, so improving the prestige of lecture halls and prioritizing their upgrades gets more total benefit than other classrooms.

You can add and remove tiles from your buildings now, which helps greatly with fitting the many differently-shaped rooms.

Each type of student has a passive that can help around the campus. Swots help with other students' grades, while Rebels might perform some percussive maintenance to fix up broken objects. The more different courses, the more variety of students, the more you can benefit from these passive abilities.

Clubs:

The tutorial says you need an assistant manning a club recruitment stand; you actually don't, assistants just prioritize students joining that club.

Each club provides a bonus to movement speed, energy, learning rate, cash, or entertainment. Depending on the map, some clubs might be more useful than others, but the Book Club improving your students' learning rate is useful on every map.

As an avid fan of TPH, I was very excited for the newest iteration. The only thing stopping me from playing it on release was that I knew someone had already planned it for me as a Christmas gift. Now that the time has come, and I’ve given it a try, I have to say… I am sorely disappointed. The game is not in itself bad, but it comes as a major step down from TPH’s management systems and turns into a glorified idle game.

The Good
+ The Animations. The graphics have that classic TPH charm, and the animations are numerous and enjoyable. It’s obvious there was love put in the detail with even the smallest interactions, and it makes for an amusing way to pass the time as you wait for classes to finish.
+ The Training System. While I didn’t quite understand it at first, once I got the hang of it I realized the training system is much easier and more streamlined than TPH.
+ The Humor and Radio. The radio is entertaining to listen to, albeit a bit repetitive once you’ve heard all the ‘shows.’ The classes and item descriptions are unique and come with a humorous flair that adds a nice amount of flavor text to the game.
+ The Building. Being able to build the campus buildings themselves is a nice addition to the game, and can add a bit more complexity. I especially like the option to buy plots with or without the buildings included, so those who prefer just interior (like myself) don’t have to worry about the buildings, while giving the freedom of building to those who enjoy it.

The Meh
- Relationships. The introduction of relationships, both platonic and romantic, is an interesting choice. It makes it a bit more entertaining to watch the students interact with each other, become friends, fall in love, but as your campus starts to grow beyond 20 or so students it becomes hard to keep track of them, much less care about any of them individually. Even if you do find some you grow attached to (I had a particularly funny gay clown couple often show up at the forefront of my game), they’re gone forever in 3 in-game years that go by quite quickly, making it simply not worth the time or effort.
- The Requests. I’ll expand on the bad part of this in a minute, but the reason this starts in Meh is because they’re pretty much completely optional, despite being an integral part of the ‘gameplay.’ You can give them what they want… or don’t, it doesn’t really matter. A student wants a decorative poster, better buy one or they’ll get upset… except they won’t. A student needs an item for an assignment, better get it for them or they’ll fail… except they won’t. The difference fulfilling the goals makes is completely negligible.

The Bad
- The UI. Ugly and cluttered, the many, many tabs and pages in TPC tell you the same information repackaged in different ways. There are graphs and charts now, and while that seems useful, the information tells you… what, exactly? Most of it is simply not helpful, and the sheer amount of it gets in the way of looking at anything that could be of use.
- The Management. Dumbed down significantly since TPH, the idea of a management sim is completely lacking here. You pick the overall course that the students take, but… that’s pretty much it. You can’t pick the specific classes they take, you can’t edit the schedule, you have no control over what the students take and when. Perhaps they intended for it to be a more laid-back game, but instead it goes too far and becomes boring instead of relaxing.
- The Requests. Good God, the student requests. They’re never-ending and absolutely relentless. You can dismiss one for whatever reason, lack of money, lack of Kudos, and it’ll be back within two minutes, usually less. This is the meat of the gameplay, so if you choose to decline the requests, you’ve got literally nothing to do. Each request (along with the monthly income statement) pauses the game and gives you a full-screen popup with a description of what they want.
- The Gameplay. Tying back into the lessening of management responsibilities, the gameplay is simply lacking. You build the rooms it tells you to, hire the staff it tells you to, and click start. For the next in-game year, your students go to their classes, rest in the dorm, party hard in the student lounge… and absolutely inundate you with inane requests, as stated above. Buy a poster, buy a machine… rinse and repeat. That is essentially the game - let it run, buy what the students ask you to, and sit back and watch. The students will get assignments they’ll fulfill on their own, and you get to watch a little bubble appear above their head and fill up to give you the illusion that something has happened. You can assign a specific student extra tutoring, if you wan’t… or they’ll go on their own without your intervention. There’s simply not much for you to do beside building room after room with the same recipe, regardless of the class.

As harsh as my review may seem, I really wish there was a “meh” option, rather than completely not recommending it. My expectations going in were clearly for a completely different game than the one they wanted to make, and once I could get used to the difference in the type of game I was playing, it’s not really all that bad. I can play it for a while and enjoy it, though perhaps not as long as I could binge a session of TPH. For what it is, essentially a glorified idle game with no real challenge, definitely wait for a sale, and know what you’re going into before buying it."

Im just going to say it, this game hasnt been recieved quite as well as hospital, though going to be real i think the reasons why will not affect the majority of peoples enjoyment (as well as being stuff Hospital got a pass on at launch).

First, the difficulty, yeah this is an easy game, but so was TPH until they added REMIX. Besides, this game is significantly more focused on building than TPH (which was already the main aspect of that game), youre not trying to process patients as quickly as possible, but provide a good life for your students with a wide range of items.

Second, the downtime. Yeah i will admit Campus could be better on this, but lets not act like this wasnt also big in Hospital. Taking time to train your staff, decorate, and waiting for the money to build up so you can build that new area. Still, i do think Campus should have had you do the enrollment thing every semester instead of every year. Besides, Hospital was always a chill game first and foremost, actually thats a significant part of why some of its DLCs arent so favorably reveiwed on Steam (even if the larger community likes them).

Lastly, and the one i feel is the least valid, that its a reskin. Really, when you think about it almost every building management games are reskins, build up areas to make money to build up more areas. And i do think that Campus sets itself apart in a way that shakes it down to the core even if it is similar to TPH in many ways. Like i said earlier, the goal is to build a nice college so your students pass their exams, not process patients as fast as possible. As well as Campus giving you greater control over the environment instead of just challenging you to just jigsaw rooms together. Although i do think part of the less warm reception is that it IS a different game from hospital in key areas, and thus it wont be everybody's jam.

Anyways, this is still all subjective, but yeah at least give it a shot, Steam is great about refunds anyways if you dont like it. Also not to mention its only been two weeks and youre seeing people who have 100+ hours, so yeah, speaks to the replayability of this game (which it is a lot more than TPH)."

Decent game but offers absolutely no challenge.

The core gameplay has been reversed from Two Point Hospital/Theme Hospital. In those games you had patients arrive who needed treatment within a timeframe or they would die or leave, and you would fail. You therefore had to manage your spending and staff to ensure you were capable of dealing with random influxes of patients requiring specific treatment etc.

In two point campus you build the facilities necessary for students and THEN the students arrive. Meaning you can never really lose and there is never any challenge whatsoever. The game just becomes sitting and waiting for enough money to come in to build more facilities, at which point you can invite more students...

There was the potential for a great game here. The humour is good, the diversity of buildings and characters is excellent. It's an improvement on Hospital in every way EXCEPT the gameplay. The problem is, it's a game, so that's a fairly big caveat....

If they bring out a DLC campaign or sandbox that offers some sort of challenge mode it could end up being a great game.

I would give this a neutral score if that was a thing. I don't think its bad, but I couldn't recommend it to anyone who wants a game that is anything other than super casual."

Two Point Campus is a management simulator where the player must build universities to train students in a range of subjects.

This is the follow up to Two Point Hospital, and Campus includes many of the same gameplay features, so if you’ve played Hospital, Campus will feel familiar.

Gameplay

• Train chefs, knights, clowns, wizards, spies, sports stars, and more, using various course specific teaching rooms, as well as the lecture theatre, library and private tuition room.

• Look after student and staff basic needs with a dormitory, toilets, showers, staff room, student lounge, student union, vending machines and food kiosks.

• Some courses are dangerous, so you’ll need a medical office to treat student injuries. And you’ll need a counsellor to improve student happiness to prevent them from dropping out.

• Entertain students with arcade machines, various social clubs, film nights and live music gigs.

• Train staff with new and improved skills, and research upgrades for equipment to improve student grades.

• Rival schools will send their students to damage your equipment, so you’ll need janitors trained in security to shoot them with water pistols (Campus’ equivalent of Hospital’s ghosts).

• Campus is easier and less stressful than Two Point Hospital. The main reason for this is because of how the game is divided into academic years. At the start of each year you’ll select which courses to run, and the game will tell you exactly how many students you’ll receive, and how many teachers and rooms you’ll need. You won’t get taken by surprise by a sudden increase in demand that you’re not prepared to handle, which frequently happened in Hospital.

• With the main infrastructure in place at the start of the academic year, during the year you’ll mostly just have to deal with minor requests from students, such as buying equipment they need to complete assignments, setting up new entertainment options, or adding decorative items.

• Finances are quite easy to manage too. You’ll probably need loans to buy everything when first starting each university, but the default tuition fees are so high that by year 3 I was usually making plenty of profit to pay back those loans and fund further expansion.

• There are 12 maps which focus on a different main subject, and you can earn up to a 3 star rating on each by achieving specific objectives. Some objectives relate to students passing courses with high grades, others focus on student/staff happiness, entertainment, hunger, etc. The most tedious objectives will be familiar to Hospital players, relating to attractiveness rating, which forces you to literally cover the walls with paintings and posters, floors with rugs, and spam trees all over the outside area (which in my opinion actually makes the campus look ugly, but it gets the objective ticked off).

• You’ll only receive students for alternate subjects if you choose to add them, so you can make each university feel unique, which helps to reduce the game’s repetitiveness. (This was my biggest complaint about Hospital – every map was basically the same, because over time you’d gradually receive patients for every illness, so you’d end up having to build every treatment room on every map).

• However, one thing that is extremely repetitive is Campus’ radio DJ dialogue. Especially if you want to 3 star each map, you will hear the same stories and bad jokes over and over and over again.


• It took me 68 hours to complete all maps with a 3 star rating.

• The longer I played some maps, my framerate started to dip into the 40’s and even occasionally the 30’s. Changing graphics settings didn’t have any impact at all (I even tried putting everything to minimum), it just seems that the more students and staff you’ve got, the performance will eventually decline. Usually at that point I’d already built most of what I needed and I’d just be waiting for the more grindy 3 star requirements to complete. And I don’t think framerate is as important here as it would be for a fast paced action game. But it still didn’t feel good to look at.

• I didn’t experience any crashes or major gameplay bugs, but I did see a few visual bugs.

• On multiple occasions on different maps, the bands I’d booked for student union gigs would get stuck at the side of the stage, no music would play, the students would all stand still instead of dancing, but they’d all still get the happiness bonus for attending a live gig.

• I saw multiple cheeseball matches where all players stood still for the whole match, nobody took any shots, but at the end I’d still receive a message telling me if I won or lost and the final score.

• I frequently saw doors to various rooms get stuck in a half open position with people clipping through, until eventually it would resume opening and closing properly.


Two Point Campus is a good game which fans of Two Point Hospital or other management games will probably enjoy. I think Campus is better than Hospital because its feels less repetitive and stressful."

I'm writing this review after completing every achievement for the base game and three DLCs, and getting every campus to 3 stars. First off, I appreciate that this game runs natively on a Mac, as I mostly game on console, but this is one genre I don't like to play on a game pad.

I felt that the game did a great job of remaining engaging and having genuinely new challenges for each campus. The early game was always a lot of fun, trying to get your campus in working order, with so many things to think about and plan around. It's really like a game of The Sims where you have 100 sims at once. Each student and staff member operates entirely on their own agendas to meet their needs and act out on their unique traits, and you have to set things up to help them succeed, rather than micromanage.

I'm especially impressed with how the game schedules classes and staff tasks for you, so you never have to worry about monotonous details, you just need to provide the facilities. It will simply let you know when you need to build another room to keep the proper schedule, but you never need to even understand WHY you need the rooms if you don't care to look deeper into it. Janitors will always find work to do without you needing to touch them. You can manually assign them to something, but you could easily complete the game without having to direct them.

You may be thinking that if the game is too automated, surely you won't have enough to do, but that's not true at all. I rarely got to stop providing rooms and items for my students. Arranging my rooms, expanding, tweaking positions of things, adding new things when students were having problems. There are so many avenues you could experience problems in with your campus just on a basic level that all of those finer automated details feel really good rather than taking anything away from the experience.

I had read that the game wasn't challenging enough, but it can be if you want to engage with the challenge modes, or you get deeper into the campaign or DLCs. The final campus of the medical school DLC is extremely tough. Still, even as the game may be a little below average in difficulty, it always feels utterly engaging and satisfying to get your campus running smoothly.

There are some things that get excessively tedious if you wish to 3 star campuses. If it asks you to raise your attractiveness rating, prepare to place hundreds of posters, rugs, and endless other things to meet that requirement. I understand why this is a thing. They give you all those kinds of things to make your campus look nice, so you should use them, right? I just wish there were some way to automate some of that. I don't personally care about decorating my campus to the degree that it wants, so why not a button to just automatically slap posters and stuff on the walls of a room for me? Maybe it's something they can do in another version. Not a game breaking issue, and for this genre of game, it's really not worse than what the competition has you do at times."

I love the idea of building the University. But in this game I feel like I have to solve unimportant issues, like buy specific bench for one student to stay motivated (and the offer of these items is limited, so it repeats over time) but I can't really affect the students' grades. In Two Point Hospital when you don't have some room, the patient dies. But here it is only about your perfectionism, the students can graduate even without your effort.

After a while the game is boring, I feel like I have to check all the students over again and again and buy posters and benches for them, every year is the same, everything repeats, I have to wait for the money, try to find out what to do through the year and why,... Good humour alone can't keep me interested. It seems to me, that the game is not thought out even though there is a lot of tabs, windows, messages and overviews. Maybe it is more focused on little details but missing challenge or some high level goal. I am missing the point.

ATM I don't know, why should I play it, for that price I can't see the purpose to even buy it, when I have Two Point Hospital. Sadly I already have it, so...
I guess there will be A LOT DLCs which improve the gameplay... Well, I am not going to buy them."

I really enjoyed Two Point Hospital, but Two Point Campus was disappointing. On the mechanics front, it's frequently unclear what you can do to affect the students' grades and happiness, and they'll frustratingly ignore their own needs. When things go well, it doesn't feel like it's because you're doing things right, but because there aren't any actual negative consequences to be had.

When I first started the game and classes took place for the first time, I spent fifteen minutes trying to figure out what was going on. How are classes scheduled? How do I determine what teachers teach which classes? Turns out, you don't have much input over things like that; the system pretty much just runs automatically. This sets the tone for the game as a whole.

On the aesthetic side of things, there are so few amusing animations. In TPH, pretty much every room had a unique, comedic animation, and part of the fun of progressing through the game was getting to see more of them. Despite the potential in the classes, TPC has almost nothing like those.

Sadly, a dull and unsatisfying experience compared to its predecessor."

I really like Two Point Hospital, but Two Point Campus is just not fun. I can't get myself hooked onto it at all, and I do keep trying, cause I spent money on it. I feel like I'm constantly blocked from doing what I want to do in Two Point Campus in several different ways and I keep being forced to build in ways I don't want to. The management style in Two Point Hospital felt like I was always steadily improving everything about the hospital - the efficiency, the staff training, the decoration, the research, etc. In Two Point Campus I feel like I get roadblocked, have to detour until I'm roadblocked again, and then I just have to wait for forever until I can finally get the opportunity to revisit my old ideas, but of course by then I've forgotten them. It really doesn't feel like the University gets steadily improved - it feels like the University is in a constant state of ""well, I guess I have to do this thing instead"". The changes to the UI also feel clunky and less intuitive than in Two Point hospital - almost like a completely different company made it"

This thumbs down really hurts me. Two Point Campus is a great sim with an engaging campaign, something I normally don't care about with these games. I'd also describe it as a good step up from Two Point Hospital. But, the game still gets a thumbs down do-not-recommend from me because as of this review, the game has an invisible, non-moddable hard-coded maximum attendance of 300.

To explain why this is a problem, first I need to explain the structure of the game. Two Point Campus is played in a series of campaign maps, each with three tiers of objectives (one, two, or three stars). Each tier completed earns rewards, and you need at least one star on each map to unlock the next maps in the campaign. So, the intended core gameplay loop is that you start a map, play until you get your first star, then leave and start the next map. Starting later maps earns you new unlocks and gameplay features, which you then take back with you into previous maps to earn the higher tier rewards.

Now, early maps, you'll earn the first star in the first year or two of running the campus. By midgame, it takes four or five years in. I'd estimate each year represents 40 minutes or so of gameplay on average, to give an idea of how long that takes. And, in my experience, I was running into the population cap by the fourth year. This is because the game tallies up your current students, faculty, and even the next couple years' future student admittance, to proactively enforce the 300 pop limit.

I reached a point in the campaign where I'm hitting the population limits with ease before I complete the first tier of objectives. I'm supposed to want to return to this map later, to complete the harder goals, but I know I can't expand or build more for the campus, so, what's the point? I've only bought a third of the land to build on and I'm already at the pop limit, so all that extra real estate on the map is a false promise; a waste of developer resources.

The amazing thing to me is, the 300 cap is the MAXIMUM the cap can be, and is based on your hardware. Meaning, on cheap laptops or low end machines like the switch version, the cap is low enough that I'd wonder how the game is even playable at all. Other competing games, from Parkitect and Planet Coaster to The Sims, have default limits that won't impact the game for dozens of real-world hours. Better, they include an option in settings to adjust the cap manually, and support mods which remove such shackles entirely, so that dedicated players who put hundreds of hours into a save can fully enjoy the game, and so they can future-proof it for new, better performing hardware. Two Point Studios has horribly failed on this front, as you can't even play one map more than a couple hours before being strangled by an unnecessary, arbitrary hard-coded gameplay limitation.

I should add, all those resources supposedly taken up by AI processing, and it's not even good AI. Characters routinely get stuck or frozen without notifying the player, and since you can't pick up students, you can maybe fix it by building things where the character is, shunting them to a nearby space. I've had moments where that didn't work either and the only way to fix it is to reload the game. And because there's no notification for the AI breaking, you likely won't notice there's an issue until you start getting warnings that they're about to fail or be expelled, because they've been missing classes and all their needs are still decaying. I had no performance issues of any kind, and my hardware could handle more characters and more demanding AI, but the artificial throttling and/or bugs ruins the experience.

What a tragedy."

Pros:

- If you got bored with the hospital environment, this is a game with the same mechanics but in a university setting.

- They've kept the things that were working in the previous game, such as the radio voice and the the announcer. There are some items that are the same as before, such as the sanitizer, because well, the real world has become obsessed with it as we all know.

- At least now we know where the patients with the peculiar diseases come from. This is ground zero for that type of thing.

Cons:

- If anything, it's easier than the predecessor Two Point Hospital. I've finished my second school with 3 stars and like many reviewers say, you only have to place the items and wait. The quests are easy and there is no challenge. There's a fine balance between relaxing and boring, and Two Point Campus is balancing dangerously close to the boring side. I wouldn't recommend this if you're looking for a bit more of a challenge. This game requires almost zero brainpower, and not everyone can access the black box in your head and let the hours pass."

Product received for free

I played during the Free Weekend Event but it was not worth it. I expected at least a Theme Hospital game which is a business sim by EA over 20 years ago, I had fun when I was little. The main issue of Two Point Campus is it doesn't feel like any school sim, all I need was just building rooms and watching the time fly, what happens in the campus is neither fun nor special - if this game was released in the 90s it could be fun, but now it runs out of ideas.

Even that Hogwarts map doesn't feel special. It has professors in the Dark Art but not showing anything special, simply putting a pot and a few potions/posters without real content doesn't make it a campus.

It's alright when played for free, but for $27.99 I could get better games."

Having students for multiple years and many of the aspects of student life in the form of relationships, events, dorms, and even clubs are fun additions.

If you enjoyed Two Point Hospital I highly recommend this game. It by no means is a reskin, plenty of new elements. Yet with some of the same core mechanics (building layout, staffing, humor, and overall management). If you're a fan of simulation style games I still highly recommend this game."

I quite enjoy this game .... more so than its predecessor two point hospital, which shows that they have made improvements both tangible and intangible since the first game. I also bought it on sale as well, so that factors into my value for money / enjoyment.

As you can imagine, you are in charge of starting and building a school to produce quality students and also money for you, which you can then use to further improve the place either through staff training, better equipment for your classrooms or decorations to make the place look more pleasing to the eye. I struggle and continue to struggle on getting the attractiveness of the place up, especially when it rains frogs or there's some other kind of natural disaster so it would be good to have the ability to turn this feature off, along with the temperature moderation which means you have to put radiators or A/C units all over the place, which is a bit of a chore.

One of the things I do like is that you're not pigeonholed into how you set up your school. Yes, there are some campuses where you need to meet certain requirements in a specific subject, but that doesn't mean you have to solely focus on that subject. Looking at one campus, I have one doing archaeology, V.R. and Robotics, whereas one of my online friends is doing archaeology and cooking. Another is doing archaeology only and someone else is doing archaeology and clown school, so you get the idea.

There are tool tips to help you complete your requirements, but some of them are a bit vague and so you may spend hours doing year after year of classes but not attaining them, which is rather frustrating. You can look on the help section on steam, but I'm at 3.5 million in the black, have played 12 years on a specific campus but still can't get the final star to complete the level.

This is not an ideal choice for 100% completionists, because you have to buy the DLC to get the remaining achievements, which is rather annoying.

The DLC content looks like a fun extension to the game, but I won't buy that until it goes on sale."

I wish there was a ""neither nor"" option for recommending. because I recommend it... but I don't recommend it at the same time. basically, I keep playing it because I'm trying to do different things to try to like it because I want to like it. I loved 2PH and have like 200 something hours in it. but 2PC is just missing something. I don't know what it is missing, but I can't find it. Maybe I keep playing it because I'm looking for the thing that's missing??

it is super repetitive and redundant and I'm not even sure how to give examples because I don't know what it is. I can't put my finger on it. I've already played it from start to finish 2 or 3 times and only in 60 something hours. IMO that's kind of terrible. it's too short? too easy? too few things to do? you would think that being able to build all the campuses would make it better but it really doesn't, because the builds just keep end up being the same because all the items always get unlocked in the same order. so if you look at my builds, you can see exactly when x y z got unlocked. if that makes sense.

it's no different than 2PH where you have a designated place to put the things you unlock, except now you have to build it yourself... just always at the same point in time. the only solution I've found is to bulldoze the entire map and rebuild from scratch, but can't do that til you've accumulated the funds to spend, and then by that point the map is almost completed so what is the point lol

I don't know!!! :( I am SAD because this was the one game I was looking forward to and then I got it and finished it and was like... ""ok"""

I've played Two Point Hospital (TPH) extensively, with all the DLC's, and I was interested to see if Two Point Campus (TPC) would be just as good, or, as sometimes happens, worse, as a sequel.

While TPC does share a few similarities with TPH: I recognise some of the staff and student/patient names, the same graphic rendering, similar funny animations, TPC also goes beyond that to be more expansive in the way the game is played. There is a new choice to build your own campus from the ground up, not just placing rooms into pre-built structures. If you don't like the base structure the devs have included, you can demolish it and build a better shape, or size of base structure that you like.

As you play further through the 12 levels/campuses, you also have the option of including more or less courses that you have unlocked. This means that you can make unique universities each time you decide to replay any particular one. A Sandbox mode has been included too so there is a lot of replayability while you build your best campus ever.

I've not had issues with stability, no crashing, but the pawns sometimes have a few pathing issues. They do tend to cluster up in doorways, and often walk into each other, getting stuck or pushing each other along. Once or twice, characters have just gotten stuck in a random place and just won't move again. It's not game breaking though, and a quick fix for this is to hit 'Quick Save' and then reload the game. The stuck student will then resume as normal.

Some of the radio broadcasts are just not funny, unfortunately. The 'student' broadcasts by Felicity Bellbottoms are a bit cringey, just not hitting the right note. But, Sir Nigel, Ricky and Harrison Wolff are on top form, as ever.

It's definitely worth a go, and you'll have plenty of fun with the constructing as well as the exterior decoration function. The themes are also well thought out and you won't lack for entertainment. One caveat I will mention is not to allow in too many students too early on, as it can get frenetic and cause problems with students not getting enough assistance in their learning, resulting in more fails or drop-outs.
Despite the two minor pathing drawbacks I have mentioned, I am really enjoying it. :}"

I have about 170 hours on TPH and I really love it so much. I finished the base game twice and even bought some DLCs because I couldnt get enough. When i heard about TPC i was so excited that my boyfriend got it for me pre-launch. Honestly, as with every review, if you are looking for another TPH but school version, this isnt the game. TPC lacks a lot of gameplay, feels more like youre building rooms after rooms and they dont really have that much effect on the grades or happiness of the students. Just with the basic rooms and no upgrades, the students are already able to get good grades. There is no indication of what the different items or prestige will do to affect the results. If you want a game like TPH but school version and much cheaper, I recommend Academia: School Simulator. I waited months to play this and I couldnt even bring myself to play for more than 6h of this game. Even then i was kinda forcing myself because I didnt want to waste the money spent."

To Whom It May Concern,
While I have (at times) enjoyed my time here at Two Point Campus, I don’t believe this position to be a good fit for me. I admit I had high expectations coming here from Two Point Hospital and hoped the fresh faces and new challenges I would be met with would excite me and build upon my previous knowledge of the systems in place.
It would seem that I am overqualified and consequently underwhelmed by the experience Two Point Campus has to offer for me at this time. I remain excited for what Two Point Studios has in mind for future expansions but as it stands… perhaps someone new to this series would be more up to task."

Good game. I'm just sad they totally forgot to add any kind of canteen management. You could select the diet, the budget, the size, decoration etc. Plus, sad that they still havent learned from two point hospital that people would like to be able to customize a bit more in terms of colors etc. we still have only 3 colors for the walls and pretty much the same for the floor tiles. If management is the heart of the game, decoration is the lungs, allowing the player to express his creativity and make this place truly his.

Doesn't quite hit the spot. I can enjoy games where there are long periods of waiting or slow progression, however in this game, every new thing feels just like the last.

It's not a bad game and there's some stuff I love about it. The humour is fantastic and the visuals and audio are fun and just the right amount of cute.

But, it's just not very interesting to play compared to Two Point Hospital. And that's a bit of a downer. It's almost exclusively down to the setting. Managing a campus just isn't much fun. There's no ""conveyor belt"" or ""production"" to take care of. In a hospital patients enter and go through the system and leave. Students don't. They enter and stay there for years. So there's not really a sense of flow or an obvious system to optimize. There's a lot of stuff going on at all times, but it lacks a sense of direction or upgrade path for the gameplay to keep me interested."

Sometimes you play a game and you think 'I love this game, if this game walked up to me in a different hat I would still love this game"" Two Point is that game. I don't care what hat it wears, I love it. Please, who ever keeps making these hats, don't stop.

What hat do you want to see Two Point put on next?

ur fake. :P
Still love this game, still want it in another hat and I think a theme park would be a great idea, I love a roller coaster tycoon and an amusement park simulator.

Outdoor rooms for rides and roller coasters, indoor rooms for themed restaurants and games, still need health and psych treatments for accidents that happen on ride, employees are managers, ride operators/cashiers, and janitors. research new rides, advertisement and events to host for more customers.

I really want to recommend this, because the first few hours are sensational and the atmosphere, humour and art direction is top drawer... but the student AI is bugged to death and murders the whole experience when you get to the mid-game.

Students will go and do other things while still technically queuing for a facility, meaning they could be off grabbing a drink while queuing for the doctor, holding up the whole queue. Twenty students will queue up at one kiosk, ignoring the empty one right next to it, even if it sells the exact same thing. They will ignore toilets and showers - no matter how many you have or how many you scatter about - and instead allow their mood metres to drain while they take classes, because the AI priority system is completely broken.

I'm fairly sure all this will be fixed and it'll be brilliant soon enough, and I'll persist because of the promise it has, but it sure is infuriating and I can't in all honesty recommend it at the time of review."

It's alright, really good fun for a few hours. But then you start to realize how bare bones the game actually is. There is a VERY limited amount of customization. You find yourself using a lot of the same types of furniture because theres just no variety. Hopefully this changes with DLC, but at the moment its very bare bones.

Gets pretty boring pretty quickly, not really much to do. Its not hard whatsoever, very easy. The new animations and stuff are fun to watch but, all in all I would say buy it on sale if you enjoyed 2P hospital, if not, wait until more DLC and updates come out. Bc you will get bored very quickly"

Surprisingly somewhat disappointing.

It's surprising that a couple of core things that were present in 2PH could be so wrong here.

>> The game is a bit rough around the edges - I noticed a couple of text and UI display errors, repeated words, unpolished animations, things like that. Not game ending by any means but a surprising QC miss.

>> The UI.....my goodness the UI. It's confusing, doesn't really explain what is happening or what are the finer details of say, hiring staff are. It is indistinct, lacks contrast and only servers to hamper the game experience. Its 'janky' scrap-book art style makes your eyes want to bleed.

>> Polish. Some may disagree but the game feels a lot less polished than when Hospital did when it came out.


Ok, gameplay.
The core game play just seems to be hollow or absent. I found the game bland and very rapidly boring. I have 127 hours on Two Point Hospital and 4 or 5 of the DLC's. Here I managed 1.27 hours and that was pushing it by giving it another go to see if I was just tired or something that evening

You just seem to get to a point with a core course up and running, a dorm and a few rooms and it's like, well done, that's all there is. For example, students just stand in the library with a book and a clock over their head, good job assignment done, then walk out. If only getting a degree in reality was so easy....

It's hard to pin down what makes 2PH so good where 2PC seems to fall flat on its face, imho. In 2PH if you were doing a bad job you had patients queuing out the door, puking and dying everywhere whilst all your diagnostic machines were constantly threatening to burn the place down. Here it's well.....they walk around a bit and just get a D-.

If there are deeper mechanics, the UI is doing a good job of hiding them. I'd lost interest by that point and rapidly had the feeling i'd rather be doing something else.

A really fun game, and good sequel for Two Point Hospital. Takes the same goofy type of game, and expands on it in a good way that it doesn't just feel like a re-skin, but an improvement.

I like that you can customize both the inside and outside, expand or shrink the campus building and it feels like it adds a lot more fun things to the game over it's predecessor.

Pros:

- Training can be chained up so that your rooms are always going.
- Higher prestige levels for your rooms so improving them on them more will have more payoff
- Classes give your students and teachers a more obvious and unique look from the others
- Levelling up classes gives the option for more students and higher teacher rankings for what they can teach

Just a fun game overall, I like the student and teachers looks. I like that the good features of Two Point Hospital carried over, and they improved on it with their latest game based on fan feedback and experience. I like the way you can customize the campus and building, grow or shrink it at will, that templates and copy were an option from the getgo. I like that it starts off easing you into the game, and then ups the difficulty quickly each level.

Cons:
- The filter option doesn't seem to save, nor does the free placement over snap to grid
- Better tracking of how many students for each course and the year, as well as how many teachers/classes you'd need would be a big help
- The 8 student limit for a class seems like a limitation that makes it so you don't want to make your classrooms bigger than necessary

Just little nitpicks, but I like to keep track of the pros and cons when reviewing a game, because no game is perfect, but I think this game is very well done, and really don't have much negative to say about this one. Mods might eventually fix the few cons I have, but they're so minor it's not really a pressing issue at all.

Good game, very enjoyable, re-playable and well worth a buy."

TPC is a fine game. As a teacher I love creating schools and this game scratches an itch. However, I never feel an overwhelming desire to play it though. I just launch it if I don't have any friends to play something else with.

What I think is missing for it to truly draw me in is some more variety and complexity. I've only 3-starred the first two campuses but it's only a matter of time, no challenge at all, and most of my time is spent waiting for the school year to be over. I wish I could make the time pass way faster, but then I'd have finished the entire game already.

I will probably play this game until I've 3-starred everything in the campaign, but it's mostly because I'm bored.

If you are wondering whether you should purchase this, love building schools and haven't played Academia: School Simulator, which costs 50% of the price of TPC, I recommend that instead as it's way cheaper, deeper and more satisfying."

Two Point Campus feels just like a reskin of Two Point Hospital and honestly, that's perfectly fine.

I feel like Hospital had a few too many DLCs, but when they were on sale, it was a good chunk of content for a reasonable price, so I have no problem with Campus following in Hospital's footsteps in that regard. Finish the base game, come back in a few years and buy a whole bunch of DLC for a few bucks and get basically as much new content as the base game had. Fine business model by me. Not too greedy and yet profitable for the developers. Win-Win. I prefer this approach to the constant early access titles that plague this genre, where you're playing unfinished games and getting essential and quality of life features drip-fed over months/years. Two Point Studios release fully featured very well polished games, which are only getting more content post-release. I bought Hospital on release and I don't think I have ever seen a single bug in it. I waited over a year to buy Campus and only played one map so far, but obviously I haven't seen any bugs there either. Kudosh to the devs!"

If you enjoyed TPH then you will enjoy this game as well. It is everything TPH was, but with higher education. It is so similar to TPH that if you just finished playing that game and are jumping right into campus you almost wouldn't notice the difference besides some menu changes and the obvious lack of medical care facilities.

However, if you playing a game that feels almost near identical to its predecessor sounds horrible, then this game will definitely fill you with sadness. Being about half way done with the game as of writing this review I have not found much that can differentiate itself from TPH besides the rooms you construct and the UI layout.

Overall, I love the style, humor, and gameplay loop that I would definitely recommend it to anyone that is looking for a relatively relaxing management type game. (Oh, no bugs or issues so far too.)"

I'm a long time fan of theme hospital. I bought Two Point Hospital on day one and loved it. I played every DLC and loved it. I Really *really* wanted to like this game, but I just.... don't... After beating the first two campuses I simply have no desire to start a third and my time with TPC is probably already at an end.

The style is very similar to TPH, with the same cute graphics, the same radio presenters and ( possibly unpopular opinion ) many of the same jokes forced into a slightly different context to sound more ""university'y"" Once I noticed this it bugged me more and more.

For some inexplicable reason they've also added a tonne of menu options and icons that add a never ending cascade of popups and panels for you to scroll through. The result was that I spent more time squinting at button tooltips than playing the game. Despite all the extra UI buttons I still can't find what I'm looking for most of the time (I'm looking at you events organiser screen)

What really lets this game down though is the core gameplay loop. Its just dull. You set up some rooms, click the ""start year"" button and survive a barrage of whiny requests for ""a new bench"" or ""a guitar poster"" (once you've filtered out the incessant monthly profit/loss mails - what was wrong with the TPH style popup!? ) which you dutifully plonk down (literally anywhere) to push a happiness bar up. The academic year ends, some more bars fill up. your progress to ""X/10 students passing whatever"" goes up and you rinse and repeat until you get your next star.

I was able to define a winning strategy for this game which was to start the year, leave it running in the background for 5 minutes whilst I did something else, return and fulfil all the requests, repeat the cycle until the end of the year and repeat. In my opinion, any game where you can spend half of your time not playing the game and still win is doing something wrong

You also spend an inordinate amount of time designing rooms to be nice looking. For people who enjoy the sims, that's great, but I've never wanted or cared about attractive rooms. I'm much more interested in playing the game and beating its management challenges. Two Point Hospital was great in that it gave you the choice - want to deck all your GP's offices out with posters? go for it! Want to completely ignore it and occasionally crank out a prestige 5 room to stop a staff member leaving? That's cool too! Being forced into becoming an interior decorator was really not what I wanted to spend my time doing.

After TPH's fast-paced, challenging and complex, but intuitive, overlapping game systems, TPC feels like a ""dumbed down for casual gamers"" clone that somehow manages to port across all of the individual parts of TPH whilst completely losing the heart of what made it great. What a shame"

Different but the same.
The mechanics are basically the same as Two Point Hospital, but it's much more relaxed. There's a lot more freedom in how you build with Campus, you can edit outside of the buildings and build your own entirely.
I've played for about 15 hours now and I'm onto the 5th campus (After making sure to get full stars) but it feels like there's a lot more to do even after you have achieved all 3 stars for a campus so I'll be playing it for a lot longer yet!

I do enjoy the management aspects and how much control this game gives you, plus the asthetic charm of two point is something I'm into, so overall i'd say I'm positive.

However, the game does have issues. Two major ones for me. First being its insanely easy. I almost don't have to interact with a lot of the intricate management aspects because the game throws money at you without you really needing to try. Second issue is locking sandbox behind main campaign progress. Really silly decision for a game like this, sandbox is the meat and potatoes for a game like this and locking it behind minimum 4 hours of main campaign progress seems a bit silly.

Overall though, because of the detail added to management and customization & the overall asthetic of the two point series, I would recommend it to people who like management. They really need to have a higher difficulty mode(maybe its in the sandbox, tbf i haven't unlocked it yet to try it). But overall, pretty fun management game."

Honestly? A bit of a let down after T.P Hospital. I was really excited for this title and it sure goes off with a bang to start!
I can see what they were going for here, truly, and that my friends, is variety. But it actually ended up hurting it in the end.
The continuity problem is glaring, presenting the ""illusion"" of choice. Campuses have finite building spaces, thus creating the challenges. BUT the game says, for example ""Like the Knight school? Getting bored of the Archeology level? Don't worry! Just introduce it into the levels curriculum!"" which you absolutely can't do if you hope to win.
Humour wasn't as good as T.P Hospital (a bit dry).
Game balancing has shifted dramatically from T.P Hospital (not for the better)
In hindsight, I think I'm only recommending this title out of respect for T.P Hospital. It's fun for awhile, but it quickly loses focus after 5-6 levels of gameplay. Doesn't keep you coming back like T.P Hospital."

I am a fan of Two Point Hospital (TPH) and I love this game even more. Let me count the ways:
1. The game's art and humour is similar to TPH which I love.
2. However, unlike TPH, Two Point Campus (TPC) comes with an expanded build mode. I love that I can now build and landscape my own lot, something that I wish I could do with TPH.
3. The theme is different: running a university instead of a hospital but the interface feels familiar and thus, easy to learn. There are lots of tabs and stats to monitor (which is a good thing).
4. Most importantly, this game manages to make me care for my students (which TPH does not. I only care for my patients as means to improve my cure rate). I cheer inwardly when my students make friends/fall in love. I want them to have the time of their life. I care whether or not they complete their assignments/ace their courses.

So yeah, love the game. I pre-ordered the game and didn't regret it at all."

Before I start I want to stress that Two Point Campus isn't a bad game but instead kind of meh. Once you've understood the basics I found that game is no longer engaging or presents any real challenge. Initially I thought this would be that I needed to play through the game to a higher map or play universities through to a 3 Star (harder) level but truth be told once you're financially comfortable the game will play itself. You just sort of sit there and watch the game play out meeting targets will little to no input.

It's a nice (and quirky) game and on sale I would say you could pass a few hours but do not expect longevity and I would certainly not recommend at full price"

What I think made Theme Hospital so great was how much you were forced to think on your feet and come up with creative solutions to often difficult problems that always threatened to catch you off guard. There was always the option to achieve just a passing result in that game with little effort, but to do it with flying colors required something extra. While it pushed you to succeed, Theme Hospital also gave you excellent feedback about exactly everything you were doing wrong and how you needed to improve, from the positioning of different rooms relative to each other and to the entrance, even down to the layout of your hallways and the placement of the furniture and equipment in the hospital's various rooms.

Two Point Campus, just like Two Point Hospital before it, doesn't do any of those things. It has the recognizable shell of screwball duncery (a better word than dunceishness) from Theme Hospital, but it doesn't seem to know why it's doing any of the things it's doing. Everything in the game comes easily, (except Kudosh, which is proof that hell exists) your students get A+ grades and in general live exemplary, overjoyed lives with little to no input from you. The game more or less plays itself. Make a new room for a new course, start at a new campus, it doesn't really matter what you do, none of it changes anything that happens and it will all go off without a hitch. You can, technically, be creative, if by creative you mean rotating a bench at 45º instead of 90º, but the game at no point will request you to perform the action of thinking. If you love playing games in order to be bored by them, then consider this an overwhelmingly favorable recommendation.

Instead of Two Point Campus, I recommend naming this game Kudosh purgatory."

Unfortunately I can't recommend Two Point campus because it doesn't really do anything well very well aside from having a lot of visual polish. It isn't an interesting or challenging management game, it doesn't use it's university theme effectively, and it doesn't really work as a relaxed building game if you're more interested in designing an attractive campus. All of this is made worse by the bad UI, which is fiddly and annoying. It's really not up to the standards you would expect for a relatively simple management game these days. Also the internal game clock runs way too slow for the pace at which the game happens, so a large amount of my playtime was pretty passive or even spent in tabbed out waiting for a in-game year to run down.

To expand on these points:

Management:
Two Point Campus is fairly simple, very repetitive, and doesn't have much challenge. Each level involves constructing a set of core structures (lecture rooms, dormitories, toilets, etc) which gradually expands as the game progresses. There is some thought that goes into placing them (e.g. make sure every building has at least a few toilets, make sure dormitories are placed somewhere relatively central) but you figure these out quickly. So each level plays very much like the last. Spend the first year placing enough of the essential buildings to make the campus function, then spend subsequent years expanding whatever elements the game wants you to expand to meet the completion goals. Repetitive game loops aren't uncommon in management games, but usually when that's the case they make up for it by using a combination of varied level goals and distinct level design and modifiers. Two Point Campus doesn't do that. Most objectives are very similar to each other, and since every aspect reinforces every other aspect a level that asks you to meet a certain level of student happiness, or campus attractiveness, or average grade all involve basically the same thing. Level design and modifiers also fail to make the repetitive loop feel fresh. Since you can modify the buildings that the individual rooms go into level design is very rarely something you need to give much thought to - just extend the main building's wall until you can fit what you need, no problem (and even deliberately not doing this to challenge myself on the later levels the variety that the pre-made structures introduced was pretty minor). The level modifiers are also too minor to provide much variety, and some of them are just tedious to deal with. The game is also extremely easy. I had maybe a dozen students fail their courses out of thousands over the course of the game, and the only student who dropped out did so because their AI broke and they stood in a hallway not bathing or eating for six months.

University theme:
I think that a good management game should have the theme incorporated into the mechanics, and doing this well can make up for a lot of other shortcomings. Two Point Campus doesn't do anything interesting with the university theme. For example the problem of balancing research and teaching is completely absent from the game, with research a pretty insignificant mechanic that unlocks upgrades instead of a key university activity. Other things that could have made for interesting mechanics like grants, alumni relations or student politics are also absent. I'm not saying they need to have the specific things I just mentioned, but some effort to make the mechanics match the theme would have gone a long way.

Relaxed builder:
This is more subjective, but I don't think Two Point Hospital does a very good job scratching the itch for light management games that let you build attractive things. Most of the items are unlocked with a secondary currency called kudosh, mostly earned by completing objectives. This means that if you want to decorate a place nicely you need to spend kudosh or use a very limited set of options. But kudosh is also used to unlock key items, so focusing on decorative options will cripple your progression in the game. The other problem is the game encourages you to place the maximum number and variety of items. Each item contributes to room quality and items that haven't already been placed contribute more. So the optimal way to play is to do things like cover the walls in posters, most of which will have absolutely no relation to what gets taught there, or to cram all of your students into one giant dormitory so they get the biggest exposure to item effects. Students will also periodically demand that you buy things and place them on campus, and if you don't buy them you can expect to be spammed with the same request repeatedly until you give in. Don't think a giant pink car-themed seat is a good fit for your grounds? Well to bad, because they'll never stop asking for one. Why you have to use specific items rather than item categories (like in the sims, which lets sims dynamically ask for things without forcing the player to give up their creative freedom) is beyond me."

I already own Two Point Hospital, so I was interested to see how Two Point Campus compares. Well: it's basically the same game. If you have one, there's no need to buy the other.

It was fun to play for a weekend, but paying $30 for what is basically the same game seems a bit ridiculous. No thanks, I'm all set. If you own neither of them and want a management sim: buy whichever's cheaper."

Here is the thing with this game. If you liked Two Point Hospital, you will more than likely enjoy this game. Does it offer something different that Two Point Hospital? Not really, but it's fun, it's a time killer and it's worth the buy if you get it on sale. Just don't expect it to be something completely different or new. If anything, I would kind of consider this game more like an addition to the first game."

I am enjoying Two Point Campus, it has bags of charm and witty dialogue in which I like the quirky nature of it, and I also greatly enjoy the academic theme; however, while I am enjoying playing the game, there is a limit to how much you can play before the inevitable repetition sets in. You complete different scenarios in varied university environments but essentially the gameplay loop stays the same; expand the campus, keep on top of student happiness and attainment, repeat ad nauseam. There isn't really a challenge and there are limited decorations and room extras so each campus you are placing the same things. I was hoping for a more endless play addictiveness but even with sandbox mode it will eventually run of steam until we get more content. I don't like being negative, however, I feel it is best being honest with where the game slightly falls down. I am still enjoying the game greatly I just wish it was a bit more addictive."

A borderline ""yes"".

What's great
- More variety, options and depth then Two Point Hospital
- Same great sense of humour
- Most levels have a somewhat challenging start

Concerns
- no mid or late game. For every level, as long as you don't do something stupid, you can make a profit and then just wait and grow to get 3 stars. The game needs some significant changes to make it a viable strategy game - forced escalation of courses would be a start, so that an increasing number of rooms is needed. Other balancing issues. Right now it is a very ""casual"" strategy game with a lot of potential."

It is a very cute game, It is fairly easy to play even for an older person.like me. It did take a while before I figured out what it wanted me to do. But afterwards I had an easier time playing it. It is very easy to maneuver the objects and the whole setup of the game is really easy to find thing. I like this Two Point Campus game much better than your other game, Two Point Hospital, which I can't really play that much, because it is harder to understand and harder to use and maneuver the objects, rooms and I wish Two Point Hospital could be mapped more like Two Point Campus, which is not only easy to play, to find what you need to build, but the whole Two Point Campus game set up is easy to find what you need. Every game is a learning curb, but I find this game a lot more easier for not only for older people but even for very young children to play. I would recommend for people to check it out. It is a relaxing game. An you can take your time in playing it and design your campus the way you would like. I like this game very much and I would recommend it for old and young people alike."

So. After fully beating the game, with a few two stars, and a few three stars in various places, I shall finally give this a review.

First of all, the game is genuinely quite fun, if you are relying on the humor, and gimmick's that made Two Point Hospital great. Otherwise, if you are buying this, expecting a fully different game, don't. It is indeed, exactly like the first game, without very much difference, except that you are building a college, instead of a hospital, and that comes with a few new quirks.

The game is a solid 8-12 hours, to complete, depending on if ya rush, though I'm sure someone could do it a lot quicker. I didn't encounter many bugs during that time, aside from students and rarely, a staff member, just walking around, both needing to take the biggest dump of their lives, and also smelling astoundingly bad, but apparently not having enough time to do that inbetween the entire school year. It's able to be worked around, but it certainly needs to be looked at by the Dev Team.

It's very easy to cheese this game, and admittedly, I most certainly did for the Archeology mission (Thanks SpiffingBrit!) but for the most part, no cheese is needed. You really don't feel inclined to add other courses during a mission either, cause you don't really need to unless the game specifies that you to. Just go at your own pace the entire game, as there isn't really anything time limited.

Overall I'd rate the game a low 8/10 for me personally. It needs a bit more character, and a fare bit more additions for it to go up in my book, If you didn't like Two Point Hospital, don't buy this. You won't enjoy it."

I love Two Point, honestly so many nostalgia buttons are hit with these games. Recently finally tried out Two Point Hospital, loved it because it was essentially the new and improved, albeit buggy, Theme Hospital from my childhood. Made a status about it and an acquaintance recommended this, which I had already added to my wishlist quickly after playing TP Hospital. Got this 30% on sale.

Here's the thing, I love this game because it's more Two Point feels with totally different systems and it's very engaging and fun. They added some really interesting ideas like being able to design building shapes. They made some really clever and intuitive upgrades from TPH gameplay into this.... However this is a double edge sword and imho a place where it stumbles. Due to some of the upgraded options to you as the manager, some of these upgrades I feel makes the UI streets behind where TPH was. The amount of times I haven't been able to place an object I really should be able to place and then having to pull and push the object around weirdly just to put it in the exact same position I was already in but this time allowed to place the thing. However, I have a tendency to really clutter my spaces and max out room levels while minimizing the space needed to do that, leaving very very tight spaces, in TPH this just made the pawns jumble while going about and kind of making traffic jams everywhere with folks animations going through each other... which I found entirely endearing. However with TPC, these jams seem to really obstruct some of the things, saw a couple of pawns get stuck in months long glitches of getting stuck in a table or something trying to get to a food place. It's way less endearing this time around with the UI wonkiness being compounded into all of it. This being said, if you have patience, loved TPH, and maaaayyybe consider spreading out a bit, this game is a lovely time, so far, tbh my time is skewed due to leaving the game on while I slept last night."

two+point+campus,Recommended,40.4,"Posted: August 16, 2022
Short story, to channel Sir Nigel Bickleworth, I give it three 'Meh's out of five. I suppose it's over half, so thumbs tentatively up.

The longer story is, although this is essentially Two Point Hospital with a college instead, that is exactly the problem. The hospital one was a continuous affair, where at any moment the composition of the patients could start to change, or you'd just get more of them, so it was a continuous action and reaction. The college format splits it into school years and vacations, with the courses (and thus number of students) only changing between years, and thus no real reason to build more classes or hire more teachers other than between the years. The game also tells you exactly what rooms and what teachers you'll need over the next year, so again, it's not a dynamic do this and react to that affair like in TPH. Just meet those requirements and then sit and watch for a year.

Worse yet, although the game doesn't force you to, it strongly rewards sitting on your butt during that vacation, dismissing employment candidates until a more qualified one shows up. I mean, you could hire the first teacher that pops up, and then spend a small fortune and two years training them to level 5 in whatever course they're teaching, or sit and wait until a level 5 on shows up. Which is very boring.

The gaining experience and levels from TPH is also gone, basically giving you one less thing to react to.

Add to that such tasks as ""make 5000$ a month profit"" to clear the last star of a level. Since one time stuff like research don't count, essentially you may find yourself just waiting for a month where the student experience bonus pushes you just over the threshold. Since xp is gained faster at low levels, AND you can only add more students for a new year, essentially that tends to be one of the very first months of a year. Then you'll twiddle your thumbs for the rest of the year, hoping you can do better the next one. Again, that's very boring, and I consider including such tasks to be simply bad game design.

Now add some more niggling details, like that the AI seems a bit... lobotomized. I've repeatedly watched such stuff as a janitor just running back and forth because it can't seem to decide between two tasks, and ending up doing neither until something else to do appears.

Now also add such... bizarre decisions as that you can't increase a lecture room's capacity by adding more chairs, nor does there seem to be any obvious way to increase the number of lecture rooms for a course and year. You can and will literally end up with stuff like 31 students for year 1 and the fixed 8 students capacity for the lecture room. I realize that they had to make other stuff like the private tuition and library and upgrading other rooms too useful SOMEHOW, but it seems bizarre that adding 8 more seats in the lecture room doesn't actually increase its capacity.

Etc.

On the whole, it's not the worst game, especially during the summer draught of new games, and you can get some enjoyment out of it. Hence the tentative thumbs up. But if you haven't played Two Point Hospital yet, I would recommend buying that one instead."

Two Point Campus (TPC) like Two Point Hospital (TPH) with a more streamlined (maybe too streamlined?) control scheme. Upgrades are better handled and staff management feels a bit easier. The change in flow from calendar year to academic year is an interesting change.

I enjoy the flow, and if you liked TPH, you'll definitely like this too. However, temper your expectations and don't expect anything transcendental. It also feels a bit ""bare"" although I'm still going through the maps and I'll update this as time goes forwards.

It's a good to excellent ""Space Management"" game.

Update: 8/11/22 - There are a total of 12 maps available in Sandbox mode (once Sandbox mode unlocked by finishing the 4th map or about 4-8 hours of game play or so. ) Sandbox mode, if I can recall correctly, was unlocked once you did a few maps in Two Point Hospital as well.

Update: 8/24/22 - Sandbox opens after finishing the first map with 1 star.

Given one of the achievements is for 36 stars, I would assume this would be the case in the campaign. However, because you are given maps drip-by-drip by finishing objectives, it does initially give the impression that it's fairly ""bare."" Again, it does open up as time goes on, and it does have further content potential, and thus coming from TPH to TPC does give it that ""less than"" initial feeling.

The controls do seem ""console-fied"" and the menus do seem a bit confusing coming from TPH, but you will eventually get used to it. I do miss the older TPH menus though.

Again, give it a chance! Most people won't regret it."

As someone who loved TwoPoint Hospital, I have to say, I'm glad I played this game during the 4 day 'play for free' period that is currently running before making a purchase. Unfortunately this game became stale and boring really quickly, which is a shame because it feels like a lot of work went into it.
The animation & the radio is as great as ever, but the gameplay is severely lacking. The management aspect has been dumbed down to a point where it's basically non-existent. I don't care as much about the staff and students as I did about my hospital patients and the scenarios are not challenging at all.

Where am I getting from
There are many out here, who played Two Point Hospital before. I am not one of them. I'm also not a frequent management game player. But the humour and the university theme itched a nerve for me and after the first trailers and then reviews I had to get it. So take this into consideration.

You're managing a University. But is it just one? No! The game has a story mode and a sandbox mode. To get to the sandbox mode you have to play through the first few levels though (I haven't unlocked it yet after finishing the first two levels, but I took my time and got three stars in both of them, you only need one per level, so you might unlock it a fair bit quicker).
So, about the ""story"" mode. You start with a small campus in England and have two establish two different courses. The game uses this to softly get you to learn the game's mechanics. For me - as a novice - this was very welcome. In each level you have to achieve certain goals to get a star. You do this over the course of a year, you have to build student facilities, class rooms, all these things. And you have to make sure, your students pass their classes. But that's not been to challenging so far.
Once you have the first star you can choose two tackle the next challenges to get up to three stars, or you move on to the next campus.
The different campuses (?) have varying themes. The second one is in an old Italian-like town for example and you focus on cooking courses with giant pizzas. Over the course of the game you can expect knights, wizards, sports, robots and all kind of stuff.
As I am still early on in the game I can't judge all of it, but to me it seems to be very diverse and fun! The game doesn't take itself to serious. On that note, there's also an in game radio with Bri'ish comments that are quiet funny.

Apart from managing and building rooms you also have to take care of your staff.

What you probably shouldn't expect is a hard game. It is very beginner friendly. In the second university I had to look a little more on the money at first, but that passed rather quickly. For me as a novice in this field this is nice and feels right.

In the Italian town, which might actually be French as well, now that I'm thinking about it, the rain contains frogs. Apart from that the only books I've met so far are book worms.

On a serious note:
- apparently the A button can't be mapped differently to move left. I didn't note this, as I use my mouse to move.
- One time I wanted to move a room and a bunch of other objects in other rooms would show they can't be placed like that anymore, which would have required quiet a bit of work. In the end I just didn't move the room and in other instances I didn't have the problem. But there might be some challenges to the placing system.

As I use my mouse to move and move the camera, I would prefer to be able to move the camera both up and down and turn left and right at the same time (like in The Sims for example). Like this I have to stop one movement and start the next. You get used to it and it might be very specific to me, but I would like it differently.

And when you place all the objects, some of them require to be accessible for the janitors to be serviced. This mechanic isn't bad. But getting it just rights can be a bit tricky. You can user Ctrl. To fine tune it, but it still is a bit icky.

In general the UI is very nice and works well. But you can toggle specific actions per person, like sending them to 1 on 1 tutoring and I couldn't really tell what was on and what was off, as for this there was no fly over as there is for other things, telling you what something does/is.

I think the game has a very nice flow. When you build new rooms it immediately shows you all the fitting and suitable furniture for example. Also it has a good pace for me so far. One year doesn't take to long. I'd say it's about an hour in real life. Then you have the summer break to prepare your campus for the next year, build new rooms for new or upgraded course. Here you can take as long as you like, before you start back into the school year. And then you still have the option to actually pause your game.
So far this all works very well for me with a good feeling of progression.

Yes, absolutely. I've had lots of fun so far and unlike other (micro)managing games this has an entrance that hooked me instead of spooking me. It's fool of humour and crazy ideas. Not your everyday university life.
It's not a hardcore game. This is for a relaxed evening and watching your fantastic university and all the life it contains. It's also fun to just watch that.
So give it a go!

I might update this further down the line, but for now that's it folks!

Has all the fun and charm of the Two Point Hospital game and it's highly addicting. Aside from one or two small issues, the game is wonderfully bug free....except....

I can not see more than a full building or so - all these photographs posted on the web showing the campus from high above, or shown that same way in numerous videos, are impossible for me to duplicate. Basically speaking, my ""zoom"" pulls back only so far and consequently makes it difficult to see anything but the building I'm working on - I need to scroll around the map to view which properties are available since I can't zoom out enough to see them or see how neighboring buildings might be doing without scrolling over to that side of the screen. It's quite frustrating, but a problem I can live with. So long as the game itself is playable, and it is."

didnt have faith in a campus sim after TPH but it's amazing. if you liked tph I doubt you won't like this too since it's basically a game-sized expansion with exactly the same mechanics.

only downside is the lack of workshop (for now)"

Great game. If you liked two point hospital then you'll enjoy this. I found it MUCH easier than Hospital though, its definitely a fun low stress way to tick away 40+ hours. Tons of quality of life improvements over Hospital. If you are new to the series I would suggest warming up with this game first before moving to the original game."

Putting the game aside for now. I've played sims like this since the early 1990's, but it didn't ""mesh"" with me. Basically stopped at lower levels as I got bored as hell and it wasn't improving. It's not like the many others over the years where you have to constantly react and ""build up"" to meet challenges. You get a grace period between years to do most of your major work and basically sit on your tush after that.

If you played hospital, it's basically the same theme with some improvements. Some of those improvements are for the better, some make you wonder what was going through the devs mind when they implemented it. You can reach higher levels on both workers and ""class levels,"" but they raised it to the point that it basically doesn't make sense. All you're doing is cutting and pasting the same rooms over and over especially with their ""dimishing returns"" where the classes basically handles 50% less. And that takes up a lot of room. And unless they have major league sized maps on the end, you're just basically following the same theme for one type of class throughout your building or you're doing low levels trying to create a mix of classes to make the game more interesting... It's as far away from hospital as you can get where you try to make enough money to max out personnel and equipment/rooms/treatment. I actually fell asleep playing a couple times which is not regular for me so about 3-4 hours you can deduct from gameplay time... Personnel is basically the same way, you got far higher levels you can reach, but you'll quickly end up bankrupt if you try to push the max as your income is limited to students tuition and ""bonus""
(more on this later.)

Buildings, you can actually build your own. No real challenge in that anymore except the issue of class level and what you're trying to accomplish. Pathing seems to have taken a hit in this game where you end up having students bouncing back and forth in front of classroom doors and you don't have the ability to pick them up to break the cycle. So they'll keep bouncing until things get screwed up like missing class or they graduate. It isn't common, but it isn't rare either. I've had at least 2 incidents per game/replay and I end up just saving game and reloading last save. Puts them back on track... Harder to ignore is the janitors becoming stupider then before. I tried to post on the Steam discussion forums, but it got deleted. Not because it was a rant or used foul language, but because they want people to create an account and post it on their website. Usually, I wouldn't have any issue with that, but I have too many games and I'm not going to create an account for every one of them where I have an issue. You sold on Steam, it's a common site for both consumer and devs, then make use of it... I posted to a drop box with video's showing the issues with the computer losing track of people and erroring as well as the DX error log, and it got deleted within 6 hours. I contacted Steam with a copy of what I posted and they said there was nothing wrong to get deleted by them, and they said they have no log of deleting it themselves. As the devs have access, they had to have done it (according to Steam so don't bite my head off as I'm going off of what I was told.) One video was showing the ricochet rabbit action of one of the students, the other videos showed full energy/happiness janitors walking up to the room and turning around and going elsewhere allowing the room to become trashed and nothing getting fixed. Had the error logs for the specific video as well. Oh well, not going to worry about it as the game as it stands right now isn't going to be started much.

You supposedly get more ""students"" then you got ""patients"" in hospital. It sounds good until you think it through. In hospital, you had 200 patients cycling through when you push for that level of care/gameplay. You get around 300 students one shot at the beginning of the year according to posts I've read making it seem like it can handle more when you build up to that level. But, due to how the gameplay is, it feels like you're dealing with far less. And with the dimishing return issue that I really can't see a point to (it may be somewhat realistic, but it's annoying as the game isn't a ""realism"" game,) it basically just eats up space with no real point having to create a bunch of unneeded classrooms that sit empty most of the time at the level I got bored with and exited out. If they allow scheduling classrooms/classes at far higher levels, just disregard this section as I allowed my boredom to get the better of me before I reached a more challenging stage that allows you to maximize usage.

Heating/cooling is basically the same as hospital meaning it can be more of an annoyance then a help at times. They fixed the gold certificate spam on university (good!!!!!!) so you can't just spam one item to get your room ratings up. I regularly took every room up to 14 except the bathroom and the shower room even without the ability to spam. Trying to get to 15 looks like it would be a bear to reach, but I didn't finish the game so I don't know what other things ""pop up"" later in the game to add for decorations that may make it easier..

In order to offset the continual income made in hospital, they basically pay you the tuition to you monthly as well as a bonus from students improving or liking space they're in. It levels up the university and can bring in funding as well. I can see why they did it with the limitations as you only have the same ""customers"" for the entire year, but it can be an annoyance especially if you're not throwing parties or bringing in live bands for them to give them an extra ""boost"" and shake the purse some more.

Like I said, I just can't get into it as my playstyle is for more ""interaction"" then this game has. If I comment on a game, I usually have hundreds of hours into it before I comment on it. But, maybe I'll jump into it at a later time and have a different opinion and give it another chance as I've still got about 8 games and DLC's for games I already own I purchased at the same time as this that I haven't played yet. I don't like to leave a game unfinished..."

UPDATE: I had a problem with the game crashing and deleting my progress. I contacted supported and they asked for my save, on just a few days they were able to send me the files restored to the exact moment right before the CTD. It´s a very uncommon bug, but if it hapens to you, don´t do nothing with the game, just contant support.

Two Point Campus is the second installement in the Two Point series after Hospital, but it´s a completely different beast. You are now tied to a 12 month period, your students won´t leave (hopefully) for the whole year, and it´s your job to provide them with the items and rooms that will help them improve their notes for tose 12 months. While a lot of the difficulty on Hospital was releated to placement of rooms, in here that´s less relevant and it´s money the biggest learning curve, you have to build your campus slowly or you are gonna end up asking for tons of loans, which is a feature I never used on Hospital.

There´s also more improvements in the system, now buildings are not fixxed and you can modify them as you please, and outdoor enviorements take a huge role. I particularly like the staff training improvements, you will no longer pay for a classroom, now you will have machinery and staff will go automatically when they are free, and they can come out of the machine without loosing progress on their leveling up.

If you enjoyed TPH, I´m sure you will do the same for TPC, although it´s true it´s a little bit easier, some of the new mechanics are very interesting and it´s great to see the team being able to translate the gameplay into different micromanagement styles. This game makes me excited about a third installement on the series and many many more."

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
I've played almost 20 hours and yeah, I enjoyed it. But after a certain point, there's nothing left to do. Yeah, it's buggy, but it is early access still. Just glad the saving bug appears to be fixed. I probably won't be playing it now until more stuff has been released.

Some of the achievements don't appear to be working either, which I have submitted as a bug. These include, buying your first car. I've bought many cars, and they are not triggering. I do hope that a lot more features will be added, perhaps making stuff a lot more difficult to unlock so it is something to build up and work towards. Once you start buying the expensive cars, its very fast to make money and unlock all you need.

I do wish the audio for the cars were better. Some of them sounded a bit trash and unpleasant. There's one car, I can't think of what it is now, no matter what colour you pick, it doesn't add the colour. Every other car does though. Going to the bar is fine, but there's nothing to do apart from Blackjack. Not sure the point of getting drunk either.

If there is a minimap in the game, it didn't appear for me, nor was there an option to turn it on. Not to worry though! Quite a small map.

I do hope that more neighbourhoods are added, more gas stations, etc. The day cycle is pretty short too, like, way too short. I wanted to have like 15 cars in my lot before opening but I couldn't buy, upgrade, paint and wash all cars before night time came. Unfortunately, after each night cycle, the cars are dirty again. I tried cleaning all the cars at the gas station before opening again, but, even doing that, the night time came too quickly and yet, once again, all cars were dirty again.

Like I say, its a good time-passer. I enjoyed it but, there's still a lot more to be fixed / added to make this game truly banging."

The game HAS SUCH A BIG POTENTIAL, specially if you include the developers ideas, which they shared on discord and of course, with the community's help, the game can go far.

As of now, on release, it does have plenty of bugs and it is quite ""empty"", requiring a few more features to feel playable for long hours, ALTHOUGH, it is entertaining enough for a game made by a team of independent developers who seem motivated and determined to go far."

In my opinion, the ""very positive"" review can't be real. The game is buggy like you won't believe it - my first car, the Citroën C4, sunk into the ground at the mechanics and I cant retrieve the car anywhere.

You're stuck regularly. The traffic AI is terrible. Although you can walk right trough it...

It's a VERY rinse and repeat game, to a point where the fun is ruined.

Hoping the devs will fix the bugs, but given the track records it doesn't seem likely. More activity needs to be added to the map. Mixing in a bit of mechanic sim would help greatly."

Let's be honest here, the game has potential, there's no denying that. With that being said, this game is not at all worth it in its current state and for its current price. It is extremely low quality and feels as though the devs just made a game for the sole purpose of extracting as much money as possible from the Steam community in the shortest amount of time with the promise of a full game before gapping to the Bahamas. Now is that true? I don't believe so but in the games current state, one would not be wrong for thinking so.

With both the graphics and the content of a free android/IOS game, I cannot recommend this in it's current state. It is a hell of a long way off the price tag. I would happily pay $4.99NZD for this game without complaint however $26NZD is daylight robbery."

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Needs a ton of work and improvements.

This game has potential and I want to really like it, since I am really into cars/vehicles. However, there is just too much in terms of bugs and lack of content to do much even with the recent drag race update. What you basically do in this game is run a car dealership, along with customizing the cars you buy and you can also customize the dealership site and your living areas. There are quite a few cars ranging from dodge chargers to BMWs and the like just without brand names/ licenses to approve for using their official names in game. You can sell the cars you buy off for profit and do it all over again or keep some cars for yourself.

Where the game falls short is the lack of customization for all of these features. There is a limited amount of customization options you can do for the cars and both the dealership/office area and for your living quarters as well. I feel as if there is just limited options and personality to make these how you want them to be.

The controls for this game are awful. I am using an xbox controller and while there is support for it, there is no rumble/force feedback... For a game with cars, you would think while driving around and taking cars from point A to B to get fueled, go racing or crashing there would be some type of feedback... but no this is not to be found whatsoever. If I play a car game, I expect no matter if I am using a wheel or controller to have feedback as I like that type of emersion. The button commands for xbox do show up on screen as guidance but are rather confusing to me as they remain as keyboard buttons rather than switching over to for instance, A,B,X,Y with circles. This did confuse me quite a bit and I mistakenly pressed the keyboard buttons on some inputs thinking the keyboard mode was still enabled. There is also a lack of a ""look around"" camera inside and outside the car specifically for the xbox/controllers that are not an actual mouse and there is no way from my knowledge that this can be fine tuned in settings to have it set to the left or right sticks. But this camera mode works fine on foot and walking with the xbox control stick normally as you would expect. There is also no way to adjust the cars sensitivity to your liking as well. You are stuck with however the cars handle by default.

I also know that there is a alcohol/gambling ""mini game"" I guess you would call it. Not sure what that has to do with running a car dealership. If you try buying alcohol and drinking a few beers and go out and drive a car, it just acts as if you didn't drink anything at all, there is no emersion to that, unless your at the bar playing blackjack or walking around on foot. The drag race is a good feature though beyond that as a mini game as well as the other open areas you can go via the tow truck down the road from your dealership premises.



Then on to the bugs in game, its just quite horrible and messy as of the drag race update. With the AI, Either there are some ai, or not enough on the map and roads. The ai in places randomly gets stuck or just randomly piles on top of each other or they just go real slow most of the time. No ai appears driving during the night as of the recent update in my experience. Then, when you take the cars in for repair at the repair shop and it goes up on the automated lift, the arms clip into the doors of most cars... There is also a ton of pop-in for the background scenery both at the day and night cycles, that is very annoying. I have everything on ultra settings but it looks everyday in game especially during the day it is either foggy or the horizon is too bright...

The photo mode also needs a little bit of fine tuning as I would like to see options to hide the UI and to be able to take custom photos and upload them directly to steam. Also, the day and night cycles are too fast and seemingly last only 10-15 mins to barely do anything. There should be an option to slow down or speed up the time in 1x-100x like in farming simulator for your preference.

Overall, there needs to be improvements on the controls, customization options and the bugs I mentioned. Hopefully these can be sorted out in the next update with the UI overhall and the office customization update that the devs announced already. For now in this games current state, I just cannot recommend."

I tried. I really tried to give this game a chance. Played over 100 hours...Endured the Developers disappearing act, where most people thought the game was DOA. Then the ""Big Update"" came...Drag racing. The game is called ""Car for Sale"". The developers didn't take 2 minute to search that there are SO MANY racing sims done better that the one they jammed into the game instead of focusing on their basic premise. In fact about 2 weeks after that release, the NHRA released their licensed version of their own drag racing sim. But the final straw for me wasn't the mess surrounding the customization of the lot. or the fact after all this time they still couldn't get characters to walk / look like humans. It was the ""new"" economic system they created. It was an unrealistic price for an assessment of a car, but then change the repair and paint costs based on the type of car? So by the time you're finished customizing the car, and getting it ready for sale, there is almost no profit left for it to sell (especially the high end ones). So buyer beware, this game was not ready for early release, is FAR from ever leaving early release. I would look for a more organized polished game with a competent staff and clear road map. I'm more disappointed than angry. The game concept had potential."

Seriously, has our expectation of games become so low that we pass this sort of rubbish on as ""Mostly Positive""? Standards need to be so much higher. If a game is Early Access, that's fine but price it as such. This game is similar in price to Car Mechanic Simulator 2021. That's how absurd the pricing is compared to the quality of what you get. Hell, the very first screen when you load the game shows ""Cars Purchased"" and ""Cars Selled""....

I'm not about to refund and blast a game because of a few typos. The game stutters on my fairly high end PC. Sensitivity and movement is beyond whack. I was pleasantly surprised to see that I could drive with my wheel until I found the brakes didn't work and I ended up bumping a pole. Oh well, i'll just drop into reverse. Oh wait, you can't reverse your car, at least not with any of the buttons I tried pressing (every button on wheel and keyboard).

There's some slight potential there. Maybe the gameplay makes up for some of the mess. But let's get serious. This isn't an Early Access game. Not unless it has an introductory price of $5 until they figure out the bugs and clean it all up. My 8 minutes of gameplay found more bugs than content. Anyway, i've refunded the game. I'll find another copy a different way a year from now and if it's at a reasonable level i'll buy again.

So dissapointing. Stop leaving positive reviews for games that don't deserve it."

There isn't much to do at present. The game is incredibly easy to get rich and in less than an hour I was at 500k. Bills sometimes come and sometimes don't. Cars crash into each other. A scrap yard serves no purpose at present.

I'm thumbing this up as there is fun to be had in this game. It is early access and there are updates regularly happening. It looks promising.

I Don't know why i am trying to earn money in this game. ""Cause There Is Nothing To Spend The Money on "".
except some alcohol and gambling .

i mean the game can have so much , there is literally 80% of the map which is empty . developers please get some building and increase the world size . and some extra activities.

i would like to suggest the developers not think of this game as a dumb simulator "" but think of it like an open world with loots of stuff to do . the game is overall fantastic if we just neglect some of the physics of the game ( Which is Negligible ). this game has potential and lot of people in the YouTube community is featuring this game . but still please improve the game ."

This is a great fun game that as loads of potential, However it is is fun to play right now but there is some issues that you may want t know before buying right now.

1. when saving you get a black screen quite often causing your game not to save so you can lose progress
2. it can be hard to make money to start with and you need pateince when selling cars as alot of the time customers dont offer you a price for what you paid for the car.
3. barguin skill level 1 and 2 dont really make a difference when trying to get best price for vehicle

There is a scrapyard place where you can get junk and sell, This though takes time and you do not get alot of money for it but can be useful in a pinch, but me personally dont see the need for in the current state
There is also a Bar which you can buy booze and do some gambling, Again unless you really need some cash this isnt really worth it in my opinion as it can be so easy to lose your money, That said some people have found this useful and been lucky and earned alot of money from it.

overall it is fun and seems to be recieving updates so should only get better, There are small other bugs with the game but apart from the black screen issue and not saving they are not game breaking"

Out of the 10 hours I have recorded, i probably had fun for about 5/6 hours. The rest I wish I could get back. Apart from it being very shallow, my biggest complaint is the map. Its like an oval. It doesn't have any intricate roads. Think of a roblox map but from years ago. For a game that is about cars, you would expect the map to be fun, but you basically just go around in a circle.

The game has good potential with the upgrade system and customization. But right now, I would wait until the game is more mature."

Great Game but needs a lot of polish

This game is a buggy mess. i mean the devs are super active and are fixing this game but it really could have used another month in the cooker.

Buyer beware , it is playable and is a fun game but know that it's a Early Access Indie game.

The other issue i have is the map is way to small. i really hope they extend this map because it feels like you're in a fish bowl.

But i will give this a thumbs up. the dev's are great and they're listing to ALL of us in making this game better and for that i respect them a lot.
Wait about a week or 2 , it'll be better then i know it.

Is it worth a buy ?? Yes. it is for only $18 usd , it's a fun game."

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Just bought this game and played this for over 5 hours at the time this review was done. Yes it is an early access game and the price reflects this. There are bug at times but the developers are working on fixes and we all need to help them by reporting these bugs. The bugs I have experienced is that the game doesn't always respond when I click the mouse and I have had to Alt+F4 to force close the game at times. Then it works okay when reloaded. That is the only major bugs I have experience so far.

Good bits I like about the game. I like the open free world map and its explorable. The improvements I would like to see here would to have a minimap like in GTA V in the bottom left corner with icons for the player and the locations of the car dealer, garage, bar, junkyard and so on.

Things I dislike. There is only one thing I do not like about this game. The time goes too fast and I would like it to be slowed down to half speed so we get longer to buy cars, fix them up and all the exciting stuff that this new game has to offer. Perhap add this as an option to use ""real time"" mode as well as 1.5x to 5x time speed that would give us players a choice.

Feedback to the developers.
I would like to see improvements to the handling of the cars and trucks because some of the cars have steering that is too light for a car and there is a lack of the ""feel"" when cornering. I would like to improvements to understeer and oversteering when driving. Something similar to how Gran Turismo would be like.

I would like to see more variety in the AI traffic with vehicles like garbage trucks, buses and emergency vehicles like fire trucks, ambulances and police cars driving about in the traffic. At night time. Police cars should patrol the neighborhood area and the player should be able to report scammer sellers to the Police in the game so if they sell a dodgy car to the player. The AI Police can and will arrest them.

I am sure this feedback will be helpful to the game developers and I am so happy to have the experience of playing this game. I look forward to supporting its progress!

Keep up the great work team!"

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
I got completely frustrated by it. It plays like a tech-demo and Im usually content with playing early access titles. What bothered me most is that even after investing in repairs, it was hard to even sell the car for more than 300$ profit.

IRL there are some pretty rude car dealers setting pretty rude prices and they exist for centuries. Why can't I make 2-3k Profit on a car?

Ontop of that, the damn cars accelerate like they're built in 1930s

There is some pretty RNG involved. Some residents sell their car but it's up to you to know if they overpriced it and some heavily try to rip you off with even 20k overpricing. The car brands are also anonymized but you know what kind of car it is. Worse of all, you know it's popular and much heavily priced than in game but you cant sell it for a decent price. This game lost all touch to reality."

I can't tell you what it is. This game just scratches the right part of my brain and makes the happy chemical.

It's a bit rough, a few bugs here and there in early access, nothing is a major issue.

Graphics aren't the best, but are pleasant enough to look at, better than a fair amount of games I've played.

BUT THE CARS, there's so much you can do with them already; clean, paint, polish, tune up, among some more customization. They look SOOO good, at least to me.

The only thing I would wish for is for the cars you sell to be driving around or possibly even show up again later for you to buy, this would give a lot more incentive to jazz up the vehicle if you could see it again later and profit off your hard work earlier.

ok, gotta go back to the lot"

Great idea and even in the very early days, it hooks you right in. I slept way too late last night because of this... However, this morning I relaunch the game only to see my save somehow was
completely gone! 100k+ cash grind I did all day is gone. I don't see how you can launch a game (even early access) without at least a few game save options (like Save1, Save2, etc.).

Such a shame, I was quite enjoying it and now I lost all the hype towards it. Be mindful that at any given moment all your grind might be gone without recovery... which is quite likely, as there is a consistent problem with ""sleeping"" as it often gets bugged so you have to save before sleeping, which I was doing ..."

A good game if it were $4.99

Pros:
The progression is well paced. The grind to get money at the beginning quickly turns into an addicting race to become a multi-millionaire.
The car interiors/exteriors are modeled well for the most part.

Cons:
The English in this game is atrocious.
The conversations with NPCs are repetitive, bland, drawn out, and only make the game worse.
The audio effects for vehicles are awful 90% of the time."

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
As a real life car seller I can recommend this game, the idea is great, however here are some flaws that I noticed and tips that would increase the audience for the game.
- On your tablet, there's no way of deleting old pictures of cars that you already sold, for new cars you have to repeatedly take pictures so they appear in the gallery.
- A lot of console errors (which is normal since it's early access, but would be great if there's an option to remove the notifications & errors) other than that 4 hours straight of playing 0 bugs with driving, drinking, etc.
- Would be really unique to have in the database history of sold cars.
- Some more technical stuff would be fun too, transmission failures, engine problems, instead you get other '' major '' problems like that your car is dirty and perhaps a cracked fender.
- Bigger world, options to travel to other states, import cars from a different country as an example.
- More fluent interactions when negotiating and a bigger variety of cars.
I can go on and on, but of course there's a lot to be mentioned, I have high hopes on this one, we'll see how it'll age.
UPDATE:
- Now there is a way to delete old pictures
- No console errors
- 0 crashes, I'm at day 65, no issues with saves, nearly 20 hours of gameplay.
With each hour, I'm enjoying this game more and more, still 2 things that need to be fixed :
- As shown in the trailer that you can buy totaled cars or use them for scrap, there is no such option available, I hope we get it soon.
- Still can't save the overall data of sold cars and points for the global ranking.
Go ahead and buy this game, it's getting better.
There are not many games out there with this price tag that would make you spend so many hours in them."

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
TLDR: Wait until the full game is released to purchase.
Okie dokie.
For those of you who have seen my reviews, I typically wait until I've had a good amount of time played before making a review; this is a change of form. I didn't play this game for long because, admittedly, I was rather disappointed.
+Pros:
+The game is exactly as advertised; you go to a car show or neighborhood and try to swindle customers for cars. There's a lot of diversity in the cars you can find while out hunting.
+Car customization: being able to change the color and sheen of the car is a nice touch.
+It's a relatively simple game with the loop of: buy car, fix it/customize it, sell it, sleep, repeat. Time progresses independently so there is a day night cycle.
-Cons:
-Unfinished*: The game is largely unfinished; human sprites are wonky, some of the interfaces don't work correctly, the driving can be described as buggy and overly sensitive. *Now, I understand that this is early access, so hopefully some of these things will be fixed in the full release.*
-Expectations aren't met: I came to this game after watching Markiplier play Gas Station Simulator and I wanted something more in depth. Now, these are not at all the same game, but this is definitely more of a dealership simulator (like I wanted), but for the price I paid for it, it didn't do it for me; I wasn't immersed in the game.
-Price: So, I bought this game when it was on sale for $10.79, but the normal retail is around 20 bucks usd! This game feels, to me, that it's still in its playtesting phase; that this should be a release to playtesters to work out bugs and improve the experience, but, instead, it is up to the public to purchase this game and find out for themselves.
*Conclusion*
*This game is exactly as advertised, with a simple game loop that may keep some entertained, but that did not do it for me. Developers, I encourage you to continue working on this project, it seems like a labor of love and will do well with some TLC. It's just, for me, this game isn't worth the money (as of the games current release)."

i get that this game is EARLY ACCESS. is it worth it at this stage? No. its got bugs and more then most games. Some of the text is not translated properly and when you try and sell a car the people act as if you are buying YOUR car from THEM. People that show up to buy the cars will sometimes vanish and it will tell you that there are customers waiting in the office. box trucks are super cheap to buy but you cant sell them for anything more then 1000 over what you bought them for. When you repair a car it lowers the value that the people will buy it for. IT ALSO HAS A CHANCE TO BECOME STUCK ON LOADING WHEN YOU SLEEP."

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
The name for the game is quite accurate, you buy and sell used cars and that's well.. Pretty much it.. It's sad to see that we don't have much of the same kind of games on steam that would be worth of buying, and this isn't one of them.
On Cars for sale the profit margin is too big in the endgame..
Why The.. do we have an drifting mechanic in the game?? doesn't make any sense..
Bugs.. Bad Ai.. get's booring after the first 2 hours..
I'd rather watch paint dry for few hours then ever launch the game again..
Definitely not worth anywhere near the asking price.
If you're here from videos on YT, Save your money and run as fast as you can..
Remember to use the refund policy on Steam if you do for some reason buy the game."

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
I get that it's still in EA and It has a lot of potentials. All the ideas they have shown are cool as hell.
Although the gameplay loop feel pretty grindy and the game is buggy, it is entertaining and enjoyable.
But I don't think It's worth buying at this stage.

I mean, the devs clearly know how to use AI when it comes to pictures for loading screen. Why can't they just use AI to have at least half decent translations for the text?

Aside from the translation errors, the car models' quality is all over the place.
Some of the model looks way better than others.
Some cars have the actual rolling wheels laying on top of the wheel model fixed onto the body itself.
Some even have their break calipers spinning with the wheels while driving.

I think I don't have to talk about the bugs since a lot of the reviews already mention them.

I do see the possibility of this game being good in the future. I will keep it in my wishlist.
Or I might buy it back when I'm bored.
But if you're looking for a smooth and extensive gameplay experience, it's not worth your money for now."

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
There lack of Content purchase car from market or auction or directly from seller, wash and repair it, and sell it for twice, drag race is pretty short, that's it and nothing, Developers should add content
Game is promoted by technical gamer so children want this and just get bored
Not worth for 449inr where Forza 4 and beam ng is 428inr
May developer add some weekly content"

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
This was a 5* review up until a few updates ago.

My game now takes half an hour to load in, and i continue to get 1 fps throughout. It never stabilises. Was really enjoying this until then. I can see from other review that this is a issue a few people are having. Emailed and tried to contact someone for an explanation or to give me some things to do, no one has got back to me.

If this is fixed i will update my review, but for now, i wouldn't recommend due to the issues myself and other are having, they are game breaking."

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
This game is likely abandonware. It is heavily incomplete yet the devs are working on a “Gym Simulator”? Really? The map is empty, the tutorial is nothing like the game. The instructions are written in broken English, the Lot customization makes little sense. You cant lay flooring inside your Dealership. Controller compatibility is partial. And X & Y axis sensitivity is too high. There is no clear way to unlock a tablet. The AI is very distracting and buggy. The paint isn’t what you pay for. The only thing good about this game is the grind loop.
I regret paying for this game.
Recommendations are likely paid for as this game is not ready for even Early Access."
