Fun and relaxing game. Always something to do and the updates keep it interesting. I am 72, have tried to play other games, but they cannot compete with Stardew, so I only play Stardew. Thank you, Concerned Ape."

This game got me through a really dark place in my life. I lost my job, spouse, and home in less than a year. I would chop wood and fish when I couldn't find the energy to do anything else and fall asleep on the couch listening to the background music. I've put thousands of hours into Stardew Valley. The little successes I had were the catalyst I needed to think maybe I could have little successes again in life, too. Highly recommend. Thank you for making this game."

Ok so far from my game this is what I got:
> farming for first week
> mayor tells me to socialize with the townfolk
> decide to talk to random people
> lots of talking
> finally think i met everyone
> try to interact with trashcan
> find a salad in trash, untouched
> girl sees me digging in trash
> girl gets grossed out from me digging in the trash
> get mad, decide to follow her
> catch her walking towards lake
> turns out shes pretty
> want to know how to marry her
> find out that i can gift people
> dont know what to gift
> remembered i had salad from the trash that she saw me grab
> give salad to her
> she loves it
> advance a year or two later
> me and girl are married

Is this how true love works?

One thing I never realized until I finished the game is that you shouldn't rush it. I got everything done 8 years in game, found all the secrets, got 100% completionist on the tracker, found all the secret cutscenes, collected every hats, accessories, rings and weapons that are available in the game and have completed all endgame content. But when the credit starts rolling, all I feel is emptiness and a void that I can no longer fill up. This is a wonderful game that's just so inviting and calming to play, whether it is by myself or with a friend and now it is all over.

If you have got the time to spare, take my advice and enjoy the slow ride. Don't rush it and try to get everything with a guide early on, because all there is at the end is the credits."

I remember buying this game for my brother a few years back. Didn't think much of it at the time, but I thought it would be a nice gift for him. I remember seeing him playing it from time to time, the message indicating that he'd started playing it popping up on the corner of my screen. There was always a certain small pride in seeing that, because to me it meant that he was enjoying my gift.
Last September he committed suicide.
After everything had more or less settled down from that, I sat down and booted up his computer. All that was on there was Chrome, Steam, Word, and a few games. One of them, of course, was Stardew Valley.
He had played this game to pieces, clocking over 170 hours and owning practically everything the game had to offer. He had used every square inch to its maximum potential, and was making ridiculous amounts of cash. It was only then did I see just how much he loved his present. No other game he played quite captured his affection as much as this one. None of his friends really knew about it, however; it seems like he preferred to keep it to himself. Like it was his own little bit of heaven he could turn to whenever he wanted.

And because of that, I can't help but smile whenever I play this game.

I cannot recommend it enough; every bit of hard work the developer put into this masterpiece shows in every single aspect. The music is catchy and memorable (i'll ofetn find myself humming certain tunes from it), the world feels lived-in and natural, and the gameplay is incredibly laid back and enjoyable. It's hard to stop once I get invested in the game; minutes can easily turn into several hours. And now, with the multiplayer beta, I play for even longer with my friends, each of us dedicated to our desired jobs. Most of all, however, we're all just happy to be together."

I grew up playing Harvest Moon with my mom and it is one of my fondest memories. She would always buy me the new one for Christmas, and we would play it all day, filling notebooks full of recipes and discussing which person we hoped to marry. Although Stardew Valley has unmistakable similarities to Harvest Moon, it is a masterpiece in it's own right, one that is very dear to my heart after all those years playing with my mum.

Stardew Valley is complex and simple, heartwarming and detailed. It's complicated enough that so many hours later I still haven't completed most of the achievements or befriended most of the townsfolk, but it's simple and easy enough that I play it almost every night on the couch after work.

Concerned Ape has programmed a masterpiece; his story is just as heartwarming as the story he created. I anticipate each new release and I can't wait to see how far he takes this wonderful game. I rarely give games a perfect score, but this certainly deserves a ten out of ten."

Thank you.
I really hope the developers are able to find this review somehow.

We all have difficult times in our lives.

I started playing Stardew Valley in April 2021, which was not an easy moment in my life. Apart from the COVID pandemic, i was struggling with high anxiety/depression, college was online and the pressure, both from the university and myself, never stopped. It was hard. I cried a lot. But somehow i got through this.
I never played this kind of game before, sort of ""Harvest Moon""-like i guess. But i wanted to try something that i could just... Relax. Enjoy. Take a deep breath and calm my mind. Relieve the tension. Chill.

Stardew Valley, for me, was kind of... a life saver.
I'm still playing it (100h and counting) and the game still do what it did in the beginning: it's an incredibly charming and relaxing game, it's fun and it has likable characters, so far it has been an experience that i am very happy i gave it a shot.
It's one of my favorite indie games ever now. Right beside Bastion, Hollow Knight and Shovel Knight, other favorites of mine.

Stardew Valley calmed me when i needed most. And i will not forget that.

There isn't much to be said that hasn't already been said for this amazing game if you enjoyed the classic harvest moon type games you will absolutely 100% enjoy this. The game play seems fresh and fun even after clocking in over 60 hours, You won't want to quit, “Just 1 more day” then you realize that turned into 5 days and it's 4am and you have to sleep sometime.

This game, takes the old harvest moon concepts and tosses in a bit of Rune factory and a sprinkle of animal crossing leaving you with a sensational experience. Each day brings something fresh, There is over 25 different Npc's to interact with each day and each one brings their own charm and dialogue options depending on if you take the time to build up your friendships.

Your farm can be whatever you make it, You design what it looks like, how it runs, what you plant and what animals you choose to raise. The fishing can be a bit difficult to begin with but very rewarding and relaxing once you get the hang of it. On days you want something a bit different you can hop into the mine and find some rare gems, ores and minerals, Some that you can donate to the game's huge museum or use to upgrade your tools!

I can't praise this game enough, if your on the fence about purchasing this game or you think you should wait for a sale, Don't wait! This game was made by a single developer who deserves every single penny for all the obvious hard work and dedication. So go and farm your butt off!!!!"

One thing I never realized until I finished the game is that you shouldn't rush it. I got everything done 8 years in game, found all the secrets, got 100% completionist on the tracker, found all the secret cutscenes, collected every hats, accessories, rings and weapons that are available in the game and have completed all endgame content. But when the credit starts rolling, all I feel is emptiness and a void that I can no longer fill up. This is a wonderful game that's just so inviting and calming to play, whether it is by myself or with a friend and now it is all over.

If you have got the time to spare, take my advice and enjoy the slow ride. Don't rush it and try to get everything with a guide early on, because all there is at the end is the credits."

I remember buying this game for my brother a few years back. Didn't think much of it at the time, but I thought it would be a nice gift for him. I remember seeing him playing it from time to time, the message indicating that he'd started playing it popping up on the corner of my screen. There was always a certain small pride in seeing that, because to me it meant that he was enjoying my gift.
Last September he committed suicide.
After everything had more or less settled down from that, I sat down and booted up his computer. All that was on there was Chrome, Steam, Word, and a few games. One of them, of course, was Stardew Valley.
He had played this game to pieces, clocking over 170 hours and owning practically everything the game had to offer. He had used every square inch to its maximum potential, and was making ridiculous amounts of cash. It was only then did I see just how much he loved his present. No other game he played quite captured his affection as much as this one. None of his friends really knew about it, however; it seems like he preferred to keep it to himself. Like it was his own little bit of heaven he could turn to whenever he wanted.

And because of that, I can't help but smile whenever I play this game.

I cannot recommend it enough; every bit of hard work the developer put into this masterpiece shows in every single aspect. The music is catchy and memorable (i'll ofetn find myself humming certain tunes from it), the world feels lived-in and natural, and the gameplay is incredibly laid back and enjoyable. It's hard to stop once I get invested in the game; minutes can easily turn into several hours. And now, with the multiplayer beta, I play for even longer with my friends, each of us dedicated to our desired jobs. Most of all, however, we're all just happy to be together."

I grew up playing Harvest Moon with my mom and it is one of my fondest memories. She would always buy me the new one for Christmas, and we would play it all day, filling notebooks full of recipes and discussing which person we hoped to marry. Although Stardew Valley has unmistakable similarities to Harvest Moon, it is a masterpiece in it's own right, one that is very dear to my heart after all those years playing with my mum.

Stardew Valley is complex and simple, heartwarming and detailed. It's complicated enough that so many hours later I still haven't completed most of the achievements or befriended most of the townsfolk, but it's simple and easy enough that I play it almost every night on the couch after work.

Concerned Ape has programmed a masterpiece; his story is just as heartwarming as the story he created. I anticipate each new release and I can't wait to see how far he takes this wonderful game. I rarely give games a perfect score, but this certainly deserves a ten out of ten."

Thank you.
I really hope the developers are able to find this review somehow.

We all have difficult times in our lives.

I started playing Stardew Valley in April 2021, which was not an easy moment in my life. Apart from the COVID pandemic, i was struggling with high anxiety/depression, college was online and the pressure, both from the university and myself, never stopped. It was hard. I cried a lot. But somehow i got through this.
I never played this kind of game before, sort of ""Harvest Moon""-like i guess. But i wanted to try something that i could just... Relax. Enjoy. Take a deep breath and calm my mind. Relieve the tension. Chill.

Stardew Valley, for me, was kind of... a life saver.
I'm still playing it (100h and counting) and the game still do what it did in the beginning: it's an incredibly charming and relaxing game, it's fun and it has likable characters, so far it has been an experience that i am very happy i gave it a shot.
It's one of my favorite indie games ever now. Right beside Bastion, Hollow Knight and Shovel Knight, other favorites of mine.

Stardew Valley calmed me when i needed most. And i will not forget that.

This is a game that I have been looking forward to for at least 2 and a half years. I have wanted to have a game on the PC that had the elements of harvest moon (for the little bit I played of it), Animal crossing (<3) and Rune factory. I was super excited when I was approached by Leth (publishing manager at Chucklefish) at the beginning of December to help him and ConcernedApe (developer of the game) with bug testing and QA. 400+ hours later (off steam and on steam), I still love the game.

Farming. The farming is fantastic. It is to me one of the main elements of the game, and it's just a joy. Being able to design your farm any way you want it... yes please. Planning out what to buy every season, where to plant them, on top of the thrill of when you can harvest and reap on the gold... it's so enjoyable and addictive.

Fishing. The fishing is outstanding. From playing WoW and Runescape.. or any game with fishing, the fishing in Stardew Valley is so much fun. At first, the fishing is challenging, but as you progress your skill, you become a pro in no time.

Mining and combat is incredible. Going deeper into the mines can be tough, but if you're prepared with your food and weapon in hand, you can fend off the creatures and get your sweet ore/minerals/gems that you want to bring back to your house and possibly hoard. (Hi, I'm Bexy, and i'm a hoarder.)

Social interactions are great. Being able to become friends with the people in the town, and eventually being able to get into relationships with people and having a family with them.. what's not to like about that? And what's great is that it gives great replayability because you can have different saves with different spouses! The backstory for each of the characters too is so in depth and well thought out, you will be silly if you don't shed a tear maybe once or twice.

The actual main story is well rewarding, and once you ""complete"" it, you can still continue on your adventures and farming life with no problems, hell you might even discover new things afterwards, I sure as hell did!

Yes, I was a tester for the game. Yes, I have played for ridiculous amounts of hours. It may feel like i'm being a bit overzealous with this. However you have to remember, I was a tester. I tested the crap out of every aspect with this game, even though there were massive game breaking bugs, errors, glitches, crashes. I still love this game. I reported many a bug, and ConcernedApe was quick to fix them.

And that's the thing, not only is the game amazing, the developer is too. ConcernedApe works around the clock to make sure that bugs are fixed in quick time in order for us to have an amazing experience with this game. And that's true. The experience that you have with this game IS amazing.

Minutes playing turn into hours. Hours turn into ""oh no it's time to sleep"".
You will forget about time. You will forget about sleep. You will forget that dinner was about 5 hours ago but you couldn't' remember because you were too busy trying to fight off 12 bats that were clobbering you inside the mines while trying to gather that 1 diamond waaaaay in the back.

So yes, I without a shadow of a doubt 150% recommend this game to anyone that wants to ""escape"" for days on end with what I am classifying as my #1 Game of 2016."

INTRODUCTION

Stardew Valley.

I've heard a lot of things about this game. A lot of extremely positive things.

And I was doubtful. Was Stardew Valley really that good? I was afraid that people were just giving it attention because they didn't actually know what a good game was. And as insulting as it may sound, in my defense, uhhm....

Before buying the game I hadn't really seen what it looked like, or knew what it was about. I just knew that it was published by the same company, Chucklefish, that had developed Starbound. I had loved Starbound.. So I was playing completely spoiler free. Haven't watched any videos, no tips & tricks, just the information of a billion recommended reviews stuffed into my head.

So I bought Stardew Valley, and had pretty high expectations. If a game received THAT much popularity, it should be seriously good, right?



Plop. Into the world of Stardew Valley.

You completely start from the bottom, trailing after a tragedy and responsibility that's struck. A farm, barely any money, and the mystery of a town left in your hands. Whew. That's really a lot when you think about it.


Boy, did I NOT know what I was getting myself into.


At first, I was mesmorized. Or maybe lost is a better word. The beginning's all new and immersive, and the middle... kind of leaves you stuck. But, this is because I was impatient with the game. I went in wanting to finish it asap. However, I realized this game is NOT simply for you to buy and finish. It's something else... entirely.

The thing with Stardew Valley, It's all about exploration and management. Discovering and figuring out secrets and a beautiful story was amazing. Creative mechanics and powerful creativity had combined to produce a fabulous well-formed game that leaves a sweet taste in your mouth, and I'm going to tell you right now... it's totally addicting.

I bought the game a few days ago, and literally have played it all day since. I've NEVER done that with a game before. I found myself as a kid in a candy shop, gaping at all the different flavors, and being able to savor them all. And now, in Year 3 of the game.. I still have a lot more to discover.



Compared to others, I've only played around 130 hours of the game thus far. Buy Stardew Valley. You really won't regret it. This game is beautiful. The music is whimsically lifting, and the soundtrack is wonderful. It's a work of art. You will find yourself falling in love with the characters, and the daily routine of being a farmer who restores the life around people, and who changes everyone for the better. It's so relaxing, so addicting, and so much fun. I have played games for years, played games with far more hours than I have with Stardew Valley- and yet, I always turn to Stardew Valley first. Why? It's amazing. It offers something to everyone.

The game rewards for the hard-working. Stardew Valley is a game where you really have to manage things, yet, it allows you to explore the whole art of it. Work hard as you play the game, and there are sweet rewards. And I'm talking about rewards sweeter than all the candy in that candy shop.

Here's the thing: you can take two routes with Stardew Valley. You can either take the money route and become rich and miss half the game, or you can immerse yourself in exploring the town and what the game has to offer, but with also missing the point that Stardew is a management farming game.

Or, you can successfully find the balance between both. But how?

Stardew Valley allows you to store multiple accounts, which is fantastic. I recommend exploring with your first account, and learning the ropes. You seriously won't know anything yet, and will be like ""OMFG"" when you figure out there's a way that makes things one hundred times easier. After that, create a second account, and start figuring out farm management and what the game has to offer. This is a game in which you learn from your mistakes.

And now... I'm left in a spot where I can successfully thrive, and only continue to grow.



- Enchanting music that sings as you play

- A simple yet fun art design that you can't help but fall in love with

- Characters whom capture your heart

- A shambled town that begins to thrive

- Hidden secrets that you can't help but want to keep discovering

- Amazing challenges that leave you wanting more

- Brilliant originality, which is incredibly difficult to find

- A storyline that changes your perspective beautifully

- Lots of fun, and I mean .

- Mods created by the community to make your game more fun and immersive- however, I play without mods.

- IT FINALLY HAS MULTIPLAYER!



- As I said, the game rewards you for hard work. But only for hard work. It can be a grueling process, but it is extremely profitable. Those who don't like putting effort into a game won't enjoy Stardew Valley as much as other games.

- Time. Stardew Valley takes a lot of time to play through. It's a game you thoroughly have to enjoy and adventure out on.

- Repetitive. The game can be grueling. To reach certain goals you have to go through processes that you will SERIOUSLY hate. But, in the end, it's definitely worth the labor.




- I wish there would be more characters. Once you go through the storyline with everyone, there's not much lore left.

- More secrets and new areas, of course!



Stardew Valley offers a lot of things, and has changed the lives of many people. Perhaps in peace, wonder, open-mindedness, the game gives a lot. But I have one thing that's been bothering me for a long time... How in the damn world did one single person spit out a freaking awesome game?

Even though it's a farming game, which is commonly found everywhere, it's original with its own spins. It's extremely difficult to find a game that has such a captivating message that's been developed so well. Stardew Valley is a lot of fun and awe, and it really draws a blank in your mind.

Buy Stardew Valley. At first, it might seem mediocre... but keep playing. Trust me, the candies are still sweet. And they really only get sweeter."

stardew valley is the best

relaxation at it's finest
a quiet life on the farm
baby animals bring smiles
a lovely garden adds some charm

if adventure is your thing
there are monsters in the mine
or travel to a far off land
either one is totally fine

for those who feel more social
the town is chatty and populated
pick up a cutie at the saloon
maybe a wedding will be fated

you should definitely check it out

either way you can't go wrong

If you look at the playtime above this review, you might be thinking to yourself... ""How on earth does one person invest 400 hours of their life into a game about farming?"" Well, it's a lot easier than you think.

Stardew Valley opens with our disillusioned protagonist slaving away at a corporate job, only to be reminded of a promise that they had made with their grandfather so many years ago. A promise of something to brighten the shadows when life becomes too dreary for them. Our stalwart protagonist waves goodbye to the grey walls of their office to board a train to Stardew Valley, an unknown paradise far away from the city. And it is here, where their life truly begins.

I can only wish that we all find our Stardew Valley someday. Yee-haw."

I convinced my brother to help me buy our mom a PS4 last Christmas so she could play Stardew Valley. She was playing the same Animal Crossing game on Wii for years, so getting her to try something new was risky.

After my brother showed her the TV apps, mom humored me and let me teach her how to play. She made a farm, and sort of caught on to using tools.

It’s August now. She’s logged over 500 hours into that farm. Her cellar is packed with kegs, the seashore is red with crab pots. She wields a flashy Return Scepter that I’ve never even gotten.

This game got me through a really dark place in my life. I lost my job, spouse, and home in less than a year. I would chop wood and fish when I couldn't find the energy to do anything else and fall asleep on the couch listening to the background music. I've put thousands of hours into Stardew Valley. The little successes I had were the catalyst I needed to think maybe I could have little successes again in life, too. Highly recommend. Thank you for making this game."

> lots of talking
> finally think i met everyone
> try to interact with trashcan

One thing I never realized until I finished the game is that you shouldn't rush it. I got everything done 8 years in game, found all the secrets, got 100% completionist on the tracker, found all the secret cutscenes, collected every hats, accessories, rings and weapons that are available in the game and have completed all endgame content. But when the credit starts rolling, all I feel is emptiness and a void that I can no longer fill up. This is a wonderful game that's just so inviting and calming to play, whether it is by myself or with a friend and now it is all over.

If you have got the time to spare, take my advice and enjoy the slow ride. Don't rush it and try to get everything with a guide early on, because all there is at the end is the credits."

I remember buying this game for my brother a few years back. Didn't think much of it at the time, but I thought it would be a nice gift for him. I remember seeing him playing it from time to time, the message indicating that he'd started playing it popping up on the corner of my screen. There was always a certain small pride in seeing that, because to me it meant that he was enjoying my gift.
Last September he committed suicide.
After everything had more or less settled down from that, I sat down and booted up his computer. All that was on there was Chrome, Steam, Word, and a few games. One of them, of course, was Stardew Valley.
He had played this game to pieces, clocking over 170 hours and owning practically everything the game had to offer. He had used every square inch to its maximum potential, and was making ridiculous amounts of cash. It was only then did I see just how much he loved his present. No other game he played quite captured his affection as much as this one. None of his friends really knew about it, however; it seems like he preferred to keep it to himself. Like it was his own little bit of heaven he could turn to whenever he wanted.

And because of that, I can't help but smile whenever I play this game.

I cannot recommend it enough; every bit of hard work the developer put into this masterpiece shows in every single aspect. The music is catchy and memorable (i'll ofetn find myself humming certain tunes from it), the world feels lived-in and natural, and the gameplay is incredibly laid back and enjoyable. It's hard to stop once I get invested in the game; minutes can easily turn into several hours. And now, with the multiplayer beta, I play for even longer with my friends, each of us dedicated to our desired jobs. Most of all, however, we're all just happy to be together."

I grew up playing Harvest Moon with my mom and it is one of my fondest memories. She would always buy me the new one for Christmas, and we would play it all day, filling notebooks full of recipes and discussing which person we hoped to marry. Although Stardew Valley has unmistakable similarities to Harvest Moon, it is a masterpiece in it's own right, one that is very dear to my heart after all those years playing with my mum.

Stardew Valley is complex and simple, heartwarming and detailed. It's complicated enough that so many hours later I still haven't completed most of the achievements or befriended most of the townsfolk, but it's simple and easy enough that I play it almost every night on the couch after work.

Concerned Ape has programmed a masterpiece; his story is just as heartwarming as the story he created. I anticipate each new release and I can't wait to see how far he takes this wonderful game. I rarely give games a perfect score, but this certainly deserves a ten out of ten."

Thank you.
I really hope the developers are able to find this review somehow.

We all have difficult times in our lives.

I started playing Stardew Valley in April 2021, which was not an easy moment in my life. Apart from the COVID pandemic, i was struggling with high anxiety/depression, college was online and the pressure, both from the university and myself, never stopped. It was hard. I cried a lot. But somehow i got through this.
I never played this kind of game before, sort of ""Harvest Moon""-like i guess. But i wanted to try something that i could just... Relax. Enjoy. Take a deep breath and calm my mind. Relieve the tension. Chill.

Stardew Valley, for me, was kind of... a life saver.
I'm still playing it (100h and counting) and the game still do what it did in the beginning: it's an incredibly charming and relaxing game, it's fun and it has likable characters, so far it has been an experience that i am very happy i gave it a shot.
It's one of my favorite indie games ever now. Right beside Bastion, Hollow Knight and Shovel Knight, other favorites of mine.

Stardew Valley calmed me when i needed most. And i will not forget that.

There isn't much to be said that hasn't already been said for this amazing game if you enjoyed the classic harvest moon type games you will absolutely 100% enjoy this. The game play seems fresh and fun even after clocking in over 60 hours, You won't want to quit, “Just 1 more day” then you realize that turned into 5 days and it's 4am and you have to sleep sometime.

This game, takes the old harvest moon concepts and tosses in a bit of Rune factory and a sprinkle of animal crossing leaving you with a sensational experience. Each day brings something fresh, There is over 25 different Npc's to interact with each day and each one brings their own charm and dialogue options depending on if you take the time to build up your friendships.

Your farm can be whatever you make it, You design what it looks like, how it runs, what you plant and what animals you choose to raise. The fishing can be a bit difficult to begin with but very rewarding and relaxing once you get the hang of it. On days you want something a bit different you can hop into the mine and find some rare gems, ores and minerals, Some that you can donate to the game's huge museum or use to upgrade your tools!

I can't praise this game enough, if your on the fence about purchasing this game or you think you should wait for a sale, Don't wait! This game was made by a single developer who deserves every single penny for all the obvious hard work and dedication. So go and farm your butt off!!!!"

This is a game that I have been looking forward to for at least 2 and a half years. I have wanted to have a game on the PC that had the elements of harvest moon (for the little bit I played of it), Animal crossing (<3) and Rune factory. I was super excited when I was approached by Leth (publishing manager at Chucklefish) at the beginning of December to help him and ConcernedApe (developer of the game) with bug testing and QA. 400+ hours later (off steam and on steam), I still love the game.

Farming. The farming is fantastic. It is to me one of the main elements of the game, and it's just a joy. Being able to design your farm any way you want it... yes please. Planning out what to buy every season, where to plant them, on top of the thrill of when you can harvest and reap on the gold... it's so enjoyable and addictive.

Fishing. The fishing is outstanding. From playing WoW and Runescape.. or any game with fishing, the fishing in Stardew Valley is so much fun. At first, the fishing is challenging, but as you progress your skill, you become a pro in no time.

Mining and combat is incredible. Going deeper into the mines can be tough, but if you're prepared with your food and weapon in hand, you can fend off the creatures and get your sweet ore/minerals/gems that you want to bring back to your house and possibly hoard. (Hi, I'm Bexy, and i'm a hoarder.)

Social interactions are great. Being able to become friends with the people in the town, and eventually being able to get into relationships with people and having a family with them.. what's not to like about that? And what's great is that it gives great replayability because you can have different saves with different spouses! The backstory for each of the characters too is so in depth and well thought out, you will be silly if you don't shed a tear maybe once or twice.

The actual main story is well rewarding, and once you ""complete"" it, you can still continue on your adventures and farming life with no problems, hell you might even discover new things afterwards, I sure as hell did!

Yes, I was a tester for the game. Yes, I have played for ridiculous amounts of hours. It may feel like i'm being a bit overzealous with this. However you have to remember, I was a tester. I tested the crap out of every aspect with this game, even though there were massive game breaking bugs, errors, glitches, crashes. I still love this game. I reported many a bug, and ConcernedApe was quick to fix them.

And that's the thing, not only is the game amazing, the developer is too. ConcernedApe works around the clock to make sure that bugs are fixed in quick time in order for us to have an amazing experience with this game. And that's true. The experience that you have with this game IS amazing.

Minutes playing turn into hours. Hours turn into ""oh no it's time to sleep"".
You will forget about time. You will forget about sleep. You will forget that dinner was about 5 hours ago but you couldn't' remember because you were too busy trying to fight off 12 bats that were clobbering you inside the mines while trying to gather that 1 diamond waaaaay in the back.

So yes, I without a shadow of a doubt 150% recommend this game to anyone that wants to ""escape"" for days on end with what I am classifying as my #1 Game of 2016."

INTRODUCTION

Stardew Valley.

I've heard a lot of things about this game. A lot of extremely positive things.

And I was doubtful. Was Stardew Valley really that good? I was afraid that people were just giving it attention because they didn't actually know what a good game was. And as insulting as it may sound, in my defense, uhhm....

Before buying the game I hadn't really seen what it looked like, or knew what it was about. I just knew that it was published by the same company, Chucklefish, that had developed Starbound. I had loved Starbound.. So I was playing completely spoiler free. Haven't watched any videos, no tips & tricks, just the information of a billion recommended reviews stuffed into my head.

So I bought Stardew Valley, and had pretty high expectations. If a game received THAT much popularity, it should be seriously good, right?



Plop. Into the world of Stardew Valley.

You completely start from the bottom, trailing after a tragedy and responsibility that's struck. A farm, barely any money, and the mystery of a town left in your hands. Whew. That's really a lot when you think about it.


Boy, did I NOT know what I was getting myself into.


At first, I was mesmorized. Or maybe lost is a better word. The beginning's all new and immersive, and the middle... kind of leaves you stuck. But, this is because I was impatient with the game. I went in wanting to finish it asap. However, I realized this game is NOT simply for you to buy and finish. It's something else... entirely.

The thing with Stardew Valley, It's all about exploration and management. Discovering and figuring out secrets and a beautiful story was amazing. Creative mechanics and powerful creativity had combined to produce a fabulous well-formed game that leaves a sweet taste in your mouth, and I'm going to tell you right now... it's totally addicting.

I bought the game a few days ago, and literally have played it all day since. I've NEVER done that with a game before. I found myself as a kid in a candy shop, gaping at all the different flavors, and being able to savor them all. And now, in Year 3 of the game.. I still have a lot more to discover.



Compared to others, I've only played around 130 hours of the game thus far. Buy Stardew Valley. You really won't regret it. This game is beautiful. The music is whimsically lifting, and the soundtrack is wonderful. It's a work of art. You will find yourself falling in love with the characters, and the daily routine of being a farmer who restores the life around people, and who changes everyone for the better. It's so relaxing, so addicting, and so much fun. I have played games for years, played games with far more hours than I have with Stardew Valley- and yet, I always turn to Stardew Valley first. Why? It's amazing. It offers something to everyone.

The game rewards for the hard-working. Stardew Valley is a game where you really have to manage things, yet, it allows you to explore the whole art of it. Work hard as you play the game, and there are sweet rewards. And I'm talking about rewards sweeter than all the candy in that candy shop.

Here's the thing: you can take two routes with Stardew Valley. You can either take the money route and become rich and miss half the game, or you can immerse yourself in exploring the town and what the game has to offer, but with also missing the point that Stardew is a management farming game.

Or, you can successfully find the balance between both. But how?

Stardew Valley allows you to store multiple accounts, which is fantastic. I recommend exploring with your first account, and learning the ropes. You seriously won't know anything yet, and will be like ""OMFG"" when you figure out there's a way that makes things one hundred times easier. After that, create a second account, and start figuring out farm management and what the game has to offer. This is a game in which you learn from your mistakes.

And now... I'm left in a spot where I can successfully thrive, and only continue to grow.



- Enchanting music that sings as you play

- A simple yet fun art design that you can't help but fall in love with

- Characters whom capture your heart

- A shambled town that begins to thrive

- Hidden secrets that you can't help but want to keep discovering

- Amazing challenges that leave you wanting more

- Brilliant originality, which is incredibly difficult to find

- A storyline that changes your perspective beautifully

- Lots of fun, and I mean .

- Mods created by the community to make your game more fun and immersive- however, I play without mods.

- IT FINALLY HAS MULTIPLAYER!



- As I said, the game rewards you for hard work. But only for hard work. It can be a grueling process, but it is extremely profitable. Those who don't like putting effort into a game won't enjoy Stardew Valley as much as other games.

- Time. Stardew Valley takes a lot of time to play through. It's a game you thoroughly have to enjoy and adventure out on.

- Repetitive. The game can be grueling. To reach certain goals you have to go through processes that you will SERIOUSLY hate. But, in the end, it's definitely worth the labor.




- I wish there would be more characters. Once you go through the storyline with everyone, there's not much lore left.

- More secrets and new areas, of course!



Stardew Valley offers a lot of things, and has changed the lives of many people. Perhaps in peace, wonder, open-mindedness, the game gives a lot. But I have one thing that's been bothering me for a long time... How in the damn world did one single person spit out a freaking awesome game?

Even though it's a farming game, which is commonly found everywhere, it's original with its own spins. It's extremely difficult to find a game that has such a captivating message that's been developed so well. Stardew Valley is a lot of fun and awe, and it really draws a blank in your mind.

Buy Stardew Valley. At first, it might seem mediocre... but keep playing. Trust me, the candies are still sweet. And they really only get sweeter."

baby animals bring smiles
a lovely garden adds some charm

if adventure is your thing
there are monsters in the mine
or travel to a far off land
either one is totally fine

the town is chatty and populated

If you look at the playtime above this review, you might be thinking to yourself... ""How on earth does one person invest 400 hours of their life into a game about farming?"" Well, it's a lot easier than you think.

Stardew Valley opens with our disillusioned protagonist slaving away at a corporate job, only to be reminded of a promise that they had made with their grandfather so many years ago. A promise of something to brighten the shadows when life becomes too dreary for them. Our stalwart protagonist waves goodbye to the grey walls of their office to board a train to Stardew Valley, an unknown paradise far away from the city. And it is here, where their life truly begins.

I can only wish that we all find our Stardew Valley someday. Yee-haw."

I convinced my brother to help me buy our mom a PS4 last Christmas so she could play Stardew Valley. She was playing the same Animal Crossing game on Wii for years, so getting her to try something new was risky.

After my brother showed her the TV apps, mom humored me and let me teach her how to play. She made a farm, and sort of caught on to using tools.

It’s August now. She’s logged over 500 hours into that farm. Her cellar is packed with kegs, the seashore is red with crab pots. She wields a flashy Return Scepter that I’ve never even gotten.

Spoiler free review, with a short and a longer version:

Buy this game if:

+ You're interested in farming, even though you're allowed to make that it isn't 100% of the core gameplay;
+ You were looking for a long, yet various and easy to be resumed game;
+ You're fond of pixelated indie games;
+ You can bear resource hunting and you have some patience, as there are some RPG and crafting gameplay;
+ You love games that are supported by modders and regularly updayed by the developer himself (Update 1.5 - see longer review part down below)

Don't buy the game if those above points aren't significant for you;






Longer version:
Let's see now the most important points, including the DLC, described in the 6th bullet point:

1-
Your grandpa, who lived the last part of his life is Stardew Valley has passed away and you as his nephew/niece have inherited a plot of land in Stardew Valley itself. Bored and saddened by the repetitive and dull life that you're spending working in a big firm (feel free to imagine it as Amazon/Nestlè)... you decide to accept the inheritance and embark in this new life and adventure.

2-
Even though clearing debris, pruning weeds, killing evil monsters and cutting trees is fun and necessary up to a certain point, you're not ""forced"" to keep farming 24/7, as the game is full of side activities who can be remunerative and of course fun, such as:
- tending to animals;
- mining;
- foraging;
- fishing:
- more...

3-
this means that besides customizing your own home, buildings and clothes there is a skill system, which can shape and improve the way on how you've decided to play the game;

4-
The NPCs are actually interesting and they're worth your time, socializing with them, helping them and confronting them on events, quests is always a good distraction and worth your time, as they'll be quite rewarding in terms of money, items and story progression in general, even though you're not forced to follow any particular path. Your actions have consequences that will also change the landscape and the city.

5-
I personally recommend Stardew Valley Expanded as a mod to be installed, feel free to check it on Nexusmods

6-
my biggest gripe with SV this free massive update from December 2020 was that there wasn't enough end-gameplay elements or goals to be reached. This update addressed completely these issues by adding a new whole area, distant from Stardew Valley, by adding new minerals, animals, crops, quests, weekly quests, npcs and much more, including many quality of life changes, which make the gameplay much smoother and fluid.

This game got me through a really dark place in my life. I lost my job, spouse, and home in less than a year. I would chop wood and fish when I couldn't find the energy to do anything else and fall asleep on the couch listening to the background music. I've put thousands of hours into Stardew Valley. The little successes I had were the catalyst I needed to think maybe I could have little successes again in life, too. Highly recommend. Thank you for making this game."

One thing I never realized until I finished the game is that you shouldn't rush it. I got everything done 8 years in game, found all the secrets, got 100% completionist on the tracker, found all the secret cutscenes, collected every hats, accessories, rings and weapons that are available in the game and have completed all endgame content. But when the credit starts rolling, all I feel is emptiness and a void that I can no longer fill up. This is a wonderful game that's just so inviting and calming to play, whether it is by myself or with a friend and now it is all over.

If you have got the time to spare, take my advice and enjoy the slow ride. Don't rush it and try to get everything with a guide early on, because all there is at the end is the credits."

I remember buying this game for my brother a few years back. Didn't think much of it at the time, but I thought it would be a nice gift for him. I remember seeing him playing it from time to time, the message indicating that he'd started playing it popping up on the corner of my screen. There was always a certain small pride in seeing that, because to me it meant that he was enjoying my gift.
Last September he committed suicide.
After everything had more or less settled down from that, I sat down and booted up his computer. All that was on there was Chrome, Steam, Word, and a few games. One of them, of course, was Stardew Valley.
He had played this game to pieces, clocking over 170 hours and owning practically everything the game had to offer. He had used every square inch to its maximum potential, and was making ridiculous amounts of cash. It was only then did I see just how much he loved his present. No other game he played quite captured his affection as much as this one. None of his friends really knew about it, however; it seems like he preferred to keep it to himself. Like it was his own little bit of heaven he could turn to whenever he wanted.

And because of that, I can't help but smile whenever I play this game.

I cannot recommend it enough; every bit of hard work the developer put into this masterpiece shows in every single aspect. The music is catchy and memorable (i'll ofetn find myself humming certain tunes from it), the world feels lived-in and natural, and the gameplay is incredibly laid back and enjoyable. It's hard to stop once I get invested in the game; minutes can easily turn into several hours. And now, with the multiplayer beta, I play for even longer with my friends, each of us dedicated to our desired jobs. Most of all, however, we're all just happy to be together."

I grew up playing Harvest Moon with my mom and it is one of my fondest memories. She would always buy me the new one for Christmas, and we would play it all day, filling notebooks full of recipes and discussing which person we hoped to marry. Although Stardew Valley has unmistakable similarities to Harvest Moon, it is a masterpiece in it's own right, one that is very dear to my heart after all those years playing with my mum.

Stardew Valley is complex and simple, heartwarming and detailed. It's complicated enough that so many hours later I still haven't completed most of the achievements or befriended most of the townsfolk, but it's simple and easy enough that I play it almost every night on the couch after work.

Concerned Ape has programmed a masterpiece; his story is just as heartwarming as the story he created. I anticipate each new release and I can't wait to see how far he takes this wonderful game. I rarely give games a perfect score, but this certainly deserves a ten out of ten."

Thank you.
I really hope the developers are able to find this review somehow.

We all have difficult times in our lives.

I started playing Stardew Valley in April 2021, which was not an easy moment in my life. Apart from the COVID pandemic, i was struggling with high anxiety/depression, college was online and the pressure, both from the university and myself, never stopped. It was hard. I cried a lot. But somehow i got through this.
I never played this kind of game before, sort of ""Harvest Moon""-like i guess. But i wanted to try something that i could just... Relax. Enjoy. Take a deep breath and calm my mind. Relieve the tension. Chill.

Stardew Valley, for me, was kind of... a life saver.
I'm still playing it (100h and counting) and the game still do what it did in the beginning: it's an incredibly charming and relaxing game, it's fun and it has likable characters, so far it has been an experience that i am very happy i gave it a shot.
It's one of my favorite indie games ever now. Right beside Bastion, Hollow Knight and Shovel Knight, other favorites of mine.

Stardew Valley calmed me when i needed most. And i will not forget that.

There isn't much to be said that hasn't already been said for this amazing game if you enjoyed the classic harvest moon type games you will absolutely 100% enjoy this. The game play seems fresh and fun even after clocking in over 60 hours, You won't want to quit, “Just 1 more day” then you realize that turned into 5 days and it's 4am and you have to sleep sometime.

This game, takes the old harvest moon concepts and tosses in a bit of Rune factory and a sprinkle of animal crossing leaving you with a sensational experience. Each day brings something fresh, There is over 25 different Npc's to interact with each day and each one brings their own charm and dialogue options depending on if you take the time to build up your friendships.

Your farm can be whatever you make it, You design what it looks like, how it runs, what you plant and what animals you choose to raise. The fishing can be a bit difficult to begin with but very rewarding and relaxing once you get the hang of it. On days you want something a bit different you can hop into the mine and find some rare gems, ores and minerals, Some that you can donate to the game's huge museum or use to upgrade your tools!

I can't praise this game enough, if your on the fence about purchasing this game or you think you should wait for a sale, Don't wait! This game was made by a single developer who deserves every single penny for all the obvious hard work and dedication. So go and farm your butt off!!!!"

This is a game that I have been looking forward to for at least 2 and a half years. I have wanted to have a game on the PC that had the elements of harvest moon (for the little bit I played of it), Animal crossing (<3) and Rune factory. I was super excited when I was approached by Leth (publishing manager at Chucklefish) at the beginning of December to help him and ConcernedApe (developer of the game) with bug testing and QA. 400+ hours later (off steam and on steam), I still love the game.

Farming. The farming is fantastic. It is to me one of the main elements of the game, and it's just a joy. Being able to design your farm any way you want it... yes please. Planning out what to buy every season, where to plant them, on top of the thrill of when you can harvest and reap on the gold... it's so enjoyable and addictive.

Fishing. The fishing is outstanding. From playing WoW and Runescape.. or any game with fishing, the fishing in Stardew Valley is so much fun. At first, the fishing is challenging, but as you progress your skill, you become a pro in no time.

Mining and combat is incredible. Going deeper into the mines can be tough, but if you're prepared with your food and weapon in hand, you can fend off the creatures and get your sweet ore/minerals/gems that you want to bring back to your house and possibly hoard. (Hi, I'm Bexy, and i'm a hoarder.)

Social interactions are great. Being able to become friends with the people in the town, and eventually being able to get into relationships with people and having a family with them.. what's not to like about that? And what's great is that it gives great replayability because you can have different saves with different spouses! The backstory for each of the characters too is so in depth and well thought out, you will be silly if you don't shed a tear maybe once or twice.

The actual main story is well rewarding, and once you ""complete"" it, you can still continue on your adventures and farming life with no problems, hell you might even discover new things afterwards, I sure as hell did!

Yes, I was a tester for the game. Yes, I have played for ridiculous amounts of hours. It may feel like i'm being a bit overzealous with this. However you have to remember, I was a tester. I tested the crap out of every aspect with this game, even though there were massive game breaking bugs, errors, glitches, crashes. I still love this game. I reported many a bug, and ConcernedApe was quick to fix them.

And that's the thing, not only is the game amazing, the developer is too. ConcernedApe works around the clock to make sure that bugs are fixed in quick time in order for us to have an amazing experience with this game. And that's true. The experience that you have with this game IS amazing.

Minutes playing turn into hours. Hours turn into ""oh no it's time to sleep"".
You will forget about time. You will forget about sleep. You will forget that dinner was about 5 hours ago but you couldn't' remember because you were too busy trying to fight off 12 bats that were clobbering you inside the mines while trying to gather that 1 diamond waaaaay in the back.

So yes, I without a shadow of a doubt 150% recommend this game to anyone that wants to ""escape"" for days on end with what I am classifying as my #1 Game of 2016."

INTRODUCTION

Stardew Valley.

I've heard a lot of things about this game. A lot of extremely positive things.

And I was doubtful. Was Stardew Valley really that good? I was afraid that people were just giving it attention because they didn't actually know what a good game was. And as insulting as it may sound, in my defense, uhhm....

Before buying the game I hadn't really seen what it looked like, or knew what it was about. I just knew that it was published by the same company, Chucklefish, that had developed Starbound. I had loved Starbound.. So I was playing completely spoiler free. Haven't watched any videos, no tips & tricks, just the information of a billion recommended reviews stuffed into my head.

So I bought Stardew Valley, and had pretty high expectations. If a game received THAT much popularity, it should be seriously good, right?



Plop. Into the world of Stardew Valley.

You completely start from the bottom, trailing after a tragedy and responsibility that's struck. A farm, barely any money, and the mystery of a town left in your hands. Whew. That's really a lot when you think about it.


Boy, did I NOT know what I was getting myself into.


At first, I was mesmorized. Or maybe lost is a better word. The beginning's all new and immersive, and the middle... kind of leaves you stuck. But, this is because I was impatient with the game. I went in wanting to finish it asap. However, I realized this game is NOT simply for you to buy and finish. It's something else... entirely.

The thing with Stardew Valley, It's all about exploration and management. Discovering and figuring out secrets and a beautiful story was amazing. Creative mechanics and powerful creativity had combined to produce a fabulous well-formed game that leaves a sweet taste in your mouth, and I'm going to tell you right now... it's totally addicting.

I bought the game a few days ago, and literally have played it all day since. I've NEVER done that with a game before. I found myself as a kid in a candy shop, gaping at all the different flavors, and being able to savor them all. And now, in Year 3 of the game.. I still have a lot more to discover.



Compared to others, I've only played around 130 hours of the game thus far. Buy Stardew Valley. You really won't regret it. This game is beautiful. The music is whimsically lifting, and the soundtrack is wonderful. It's a work of art. You will find yourself falling in love with the characters, and the daily routine of being a farmer who restores the life around people, and who changes everyone for the better. It's so relaxing, so addicting, and so much fun. I have played games for years, played games with far more hours than I have with Stardew Valley- and yet, I always turn to Stardew Valley first. Why? It's amazing. It offers something to everyone.

The game rewards for the hard-working. Stardew Valley is a game where you really have to manage things, yet, it allows you to explore the whole art of it. Work hard as you play the game, and there are sweet rewards. And I'm talking about rewards sweeter than all the candy in that candy shop.

Here's the thing: you can take two routes with Stardew Valley. You can either take the money route and become rich and miss half the game, or you can immerse yourself in exploring the town and what the game has to offer, but with also missing the point that Stardew is a management farming game.

Or, you can successfully find the balance between both. But how?

Stardew Valley allows you to store multiple accounts, which is fantastic. I recommend exploring with your first account, and learning the ropes. You seriously won't know anything yet, and will be like ""OMFG"" when you figure out there's a way that makes things one hundred times easier. After that, create a second account, and start figuring out farm management and what the game has to offer. This is a game in which you learn from your mistakes.

And now... I'm left in a spot where I can successfully thrive, and only continue to grow.



- Enchanting music that sings as you play

- A simple yet fun art design that you can't help but fall in love with

- Characters whom capture your heart

- A shambled town that begins to thrive

- Hidden secrets that you can't help but want to keep discovering

- Amazing challenges that leave you wanting more

- Brilliant originality, which is incredibly difficult to find

- A storyline that changes your perspective beautifully

- Lots of fun, and I mean .

- Mods created by the community to make your game more fun and immersive- however, I play without mods.

- IT FINALLY HAS MULTIPLAYER!



- As I said, the game rewards you for hard work. But only for hard work. It can be a grueling process, but it is extremely profitable. Those who don't like putting effort into a game won't enjoy Stardew Valley as much as other games.

- Time. Stardew Valley takes a lot of time to play through. It's a game you thoroughly have to enjoy and adventure out on.

- Repetitive. The game can be grueling. To reach certain goals you have to go through processes that you will SERIOUSLY hate. But, in the end, it's definitely worth the labor.




- I wish there would be more characters. Once you go through the storyline with everyone, there's not much lore left.

- More secrets and new areas, of course!



Stardew Valley offers a lot of things, and has changed the lives of many people. Perhaps in peace, wonder, open-mindedness, the game gives a lot. But I have one thing that's been bothering me for a long time... How in the damn world did one single person spit out a freaking awesome game?

Even though it's a farming game, which is commonly found everywhere, it's original with its own spins. It's extremely difficult to find a game that has such a captivating message that's been developed so well. Stardew Valley is a lot of fun and awe, and it really draws a blank in your mind.

Buy Stardew Valley. At first, it might seem mediocre... but keep playing. Trust me, the candies are still sweet. And they really only get sweeter."

baby animals bring smiles
a lovely garden adds some charm

if adventure is your thing
there are monsters in the mine

the town is chatty and populated

If you look at the playtime above this review, you might be thinking to yourself... ""How on earth does one person invest 400 hours of their life into a game about farming?"" Well, it's a lot easier than you think.

Stardew Valley opens with our disillusioned protagonist slaving away at a corporate job, only to be reminded of a promise that they had made with their grandfather so many years ago. A promise of something to brighten the shadows when life becomes too dreary for them. Our stalwart protagonist waves goodbye to the grey walls of their office to board a train to Stardew Valley, an unknown paradise far away from the city. And it is here, where their life truly begins.

I can only wish that we all find our Stardew Valley someday. Yee-haw."

I convinced my brother to help me buy our mom a PS4 last Christmas so she could play Stardew Valley. She was playing the same Animal Crossing game on Wii for years, so getting her to try something new was risky.

After my brother showed her the TV apps, mom humored me and let me teach her how to play. She made a farm, and sort of caught on to using tools.

It’s August now. She’s logged over 500 hours into that farm. Her cellar is packed with kegs, the seashore is red with crab pots. She wields a flashy Return Scepter that I’ve never even gotten.

Spoiler free review, with a short and a longer version:

Buy this game if:

+ You're interested in farming, even though you're allowed to make that it isn't 100% of the core gameplay;
+ You were looking for a long, yet various and easy to be resumed game;
+ You're fond of pixelated indie games;
+ You can bear resource hunting and you have some patience, as there are some RPG and crafting gameplay;
+ You love games that are supported by modders and regularly updayed by the developer himself (Update 1.5 - see longer review part down below)

Don't buy the game if those above points aren't significant for you;






Longer version:
Let's see now the most important points, including the DLC, described in the 6th bullet point:

1-
Your grandpa, who lived the last part of his life is Stardew Valley has passed away and you as his nephew/niece have inherited a plot of land in Stardew Valley itself. Bored and saddened by the repetitive and dull life that you're spending working in a big firm (feel free to imagine it as Amazon/Nestlè)... you decide to accept the inheritance and embark in this new life and adventure.

2-
Even though clearing debris, pruning weeds, killing evil monsters and cutting trees is fun and necessary up to a certain point, you're not ""forced"" to keep farming 24/7, as the game is full of side activities who can be remunerative and of course fun, such as:
- tending to animals;
- mining;
- foraging;
- fishing:
- more...

3-
this means that besides customizing your own home, buildings and clothes there is a skill system, which can shape and improve the way on how you've decided to play the game;

4-
The NPCs are actually interesting and they're worth your time, socializing with them, helping them and confronting them on events, quests is always a good distraction and worth your time, as they'll be quite rewarding in terms of money, items and story progression in general, even though you're not forced to follow any particular path. Your actions have consequences that will also change the landscape and the city.

5-
I personally recommend Stardew Valley Expanded as a mod to be installed, feel free to check it on Nexusmods

6-
my biggest gripe with SV this free massive update from December 2020 was that there wasn't enough end-gameplay elements or goals to be reached. This update addressed completely these issues by adding a new whole area, distant from Stardew Valley, by adding new minerals, animals, crops, quests, weekly quests, npcs and much more, including many quality of life changes, which make the gameplay much smoother and fluid.

Thanks for reading and for bearing up with me, leave a comment below if you have any questions or observations, have an amazing day/night, feel free to follow my other reviews at:"

It captures all the same things that made those games great, and it's the perfect game to play either casually or seriously. There are so many different ways to earn money and they're all developed and fun, the hardest part is choosing which one to spend your time doing.

The progression curve in the game is fantastic too. Every day you'll feel like you're making progress but there's still always something to work towards and you won't 'beat it' after a couple of hours earning as much money as possible, as there's always something to spend your money on. Even after 20 hours of playing, I feel like I'm nowhere near the endgame, and I could easily see myself playing through again and doing things differently. I'm even doing a playthrough on YouTube and the progress feels dramatically different even in its early stages.

I'm easily disappointed by games, so you can imagine my surprise when I was so impressed by a game made by one person. Congratulations, ConcernedApe, you've made one of the best games I've ever played."

Overview

Stardew Valley is a game that borrows heavily from similar titles in the Harvest Moon series. You start out in a rural town with nothing but a dilapidated house and crop fields that are more akin to the wilderness than a place to grow vegetables. The game is simple in its understanding: build a farm, make profits, live your life. What the game allows you to do makes it so much more layered. You're left with the freedom to explore the town, its residence, mold your farm into whatever you want it to be and on your own time. Sure, there are events to attend, festivals to see, men/women to romance and marry, kids to have, buildings to construct, fish to catch and weird little slimes to slay (Dragon Warrior, anyone?), but how and when you do those things is up to you.

In essence, the game offers you very similar things to do as a Harvest Moon game does: Build and upgrade your farm, plant crops, upgrade tools, mine in the never-ending dungeon for precious ore, go fishing, romance and get married...etc. While some of your old favorites are back, new aspects have been introduced as well, but I won't spoil those in this review. Let's just say there's a nice story that evolves over time.

The freedom to do as you please is what makes this game, and Harvest Moon in general, so enjoyable. It's a chance to mellow out, play at your own pace and still enjoy everything the game has to offer. What Stardew Valley does, it does right. It's charming, cute and feels rewarding, even when all you're doing is cuttings weeds. It doesn't pull any punches or try to be something its not; the developer had a goal in mind and Stardew Valley is a reflection of just that. You can feel the effort, the time and the devotion that went into this game over the years. Stardew Valley is a gem and worth looking at. If you loved Harvest Moon, you'll love Stardew Valley.

To date, Stardew Valley is a single player game, though the developer as mentioned some form of co-op or multiplayer availability in the future.











Overall, Stardew Valley is a pleasure. I haven't put a ton of time into it (yet), but I easily see that happening. It's fun, lighthearted and addictive. As I said earlier in this review, if you've ever played Harvest Moon, you'll enjoy Stardew Valley. It's worth checking out and I highly recommend it. This will easily become one of my most played games on my list. You won't be disappointed, so check it out!"

I was never interested in farming games. I’ve never played a Harvest Moon game or an Animal Crossing game, and never had any interest in them. The closest thing to a farming game I’ve ever played was Minecraft. I definitely would have never tried Stardew Valley if I wasn’t an achievement hunter and it didn’t have achievements.

But now I see what all the hype was about.

Stardew Valley is a game that is very easy to lose oneself into. There are many elements of the game that feel intimately relatable to real life, especially the game’s premise: you’re stuck at a soul-crushing corporate office job when your grandfather dies, leaving you an envelope telling you to open it only when you’ve reached your absolute limit and need something new. After a particularly bad day at work, you finally decide to open the envelope and find a deed to your grandfather’s farm on a far-off island, so you take the plunge and decide to move there. It is a very strong analogy to the game itself, where you, the player, are seeking escapism from your daily life and decide to take the plunge into this game, not knowing what else to expect.

In Stardew Valley, you will find your new home upon a sizable but absolutely trashed plot of land. As the days go by, you can clean up the land and discover hundreds of ways to make a profit with what you’ve been given, from buying seeds and planting crops, to raising animals, to fishing (by means of a surprisingly pleasant and addictive quicktime event), to foraging for wild food, and even to exploring a few combat-centric Zelda-style dungeons. But you’re not making money for its own sake – there are dozens of mysterious secrets scattered about the land, each with significant and game-changing rewards at the end, and you need to raise the money and resources to investigate them all. The game experience is going to be totally different for everybody depending on what game elements you are inspired to pursue first. Although you’ll assuredly be looking at a wiki in due time, it is deeply satisfying to go in blind and piece things together yourself for as long as you can.

Years consist of four months, each month being 28-day season. Some gameplay mechanics change with the seasons, particularly that certain crops only grow in certain seasons, and (almost) no crops grow in winter, so you’ll have to carefully consider what seeds to plant and when. Each day lasts about five minutes, and you’ve got to make sure you’re back in your house by 2AM, or else you’ll pass out and lose some money. The biggest way the game hooks you is the fact that your progress is only saved at the of a day – so if you’re eager to wake up in the morning and harvest your crops, it won’t mean anything unless you play the whole day through. A vicious cycle! I clocked 120 hours of this game in the first 2 weeks of playing. That’s how bad it is.

Another one of the game’s strengths is the cozy little community you live beside, with a population of about 25 people. The game does a wonderful job of making each character feel like their own entity, with their own daily routines and backstories and motivations. You’ll really get to know and love them. You can give gifts to characters to increase friendship level with them, unlocking character development cutscenes and important rewards. You can even date some of them (you can have 6 boyfriends and 6 girlfriends at once if you want, no joke; relationships are gender-indiscriminate) and then marry the character of your choice. The social aspect is sometimes a bit too real – you’ll feel the pain of rejection all too often – but that makes the successful relationships all the more heartwarming.

As for complaints: surprisingly, the game has some strange and baffling bugs, most of which are visual (like ice-skating horses), but some which affect gameplay, and a few known save-corruption bugs. I also felt consistently uncomfortable with the controls. If you're using the mouse, your cursor needs to always be in proximity of your character, or else you'll only aim at the tile in front of you, making it very easy to abruptly turn the wrong direction while working. And if you accidentally click the wrong tile, your character will turn to face it, changing the default direction you aim, compounding the problem. It can be infuriating, especially if it causes you to accidentally destroy crops. Also, I don't like how you can only talk to NPCs if you have a tool selected, and how you'll use a consumable item at the same time as opening a door if you have one selected. The controls could definitely use some additional polish.

Then there are the inventory controls. If you click on an inventory item, you pick it up and you can drop it in a different inventory slot. If you click on an inventory item with a storage box open, you will immediately transfer the item into (or out of) the box. Thus, it is impossible to organize the inventory with a storage box open. If you click on an inventory item while in a shop, . I can't tell you the amount of times I purchased 200 seeds, then immediately sold them again just because I tried to pick them up and put them in a different slot.

Also, I can’t help but feel the game should have even more content than it already does – perhaps more dungeons, a bigger map, and the ability to run more than one farm. But (as of this writing) the game is still in active development, including a co-op multiplayer patch in the works, and a lively modding community.

I give this game an 8/10. A wonderful example of what all those crappy Farmville mobile games would be like if they were actually balanced around gameplay and not milking the player with microtansactions and daily login bonuses. Despite some stupidly distracting bugs and annoying controls, it’s some simply wonderful escapism, and made me finally see the appeal in a farming game. It does get stale in time, but not before offering a huge amount of joy. For achievement hunting, it’ll easily take about 200 hours, especially blind… but if you’re like me, you’ll have it over with in a month or two. A huge thumbs-up."

One thing I never realized until I finished the game is that you shouldn't rush it. I got everything done 8 years in game, found all the secrets, got 100% completionist on the tracker, found all the secret cutscenes, collected every hats, accessories, rings and weapons that are available in the game and have completed all endgame content. But when the credit starts rolling, all I feel is emptiness and a void that I can no longer fill up. This is a wonderful game that's just so inviting and calming to play, whether it is by myself or with a friend and now it is all over.

If you have got the time to spare, take my advice and enjoy the slow ride. Don't rush it and try to get everything with a guide early on, because all there is at the end is the credits."

I remember buying this game for my brother a few years back. Didn't think much of it at the time, but I thought it would be a nice gift for him. I remember seeing him playing it from time to time, the message indicating that he'd started playing it popping up on the corner of my screen. There was always a certain small pride in seeing that, because to me it meant that he was enjoying my gift.
Last September he committed suicide.
After everything had more or less settled down from that, I sat down and booted up his computer. All that was on there was Chrome, Steam, Word, and a few games. One of them, of course, was Stardew Valley.
He had played this game to pieces, clocking over 170 hours and owning practically everything the game had to offer. He had used every square inch to its maximum potential, and was making ridiculous amounts of cash. It was only then did I see just how much he loved his present. No other game he played quite captured his affection as much as this one. None of his friends really knew about it, however; it seems like he preferred to keep it to himself. Like it was his own little bit of heaven he could turn to whenever he wanted.

And because of that, I can't help but smile whenever I play this game.

I cannot recommend it enough; every bit of hard work the developer put into this masterpiece shows in every single aspect. The music is catchy and memorable (i'll ofetn find myself humming certain tunes from it), the world feels lived-in and natural, and the gameplay is incredibly laid back and enjoyable. It's hard to stop once I get invested in the game; minutes can easily turn into several hours. And now, with the multiplayer beta, I play for even longer with my friends, each of us dedicated to our desired jobs. Most of all, however, we're all just happy to be together."

I grew up playing Harvest Moon with my mom and it is one of my fondest memories. She would always buy me the new one for Christmas, and we would play it all day, filling notebooks full of recipes and discussing which person we hoped to marry. Although Stardew Valley has unmistakable similarities to Harvest Moon, it is a masterpiece in it's own right, one that is very dear to my heart after all those years playing with my mum.

Stardew Valley is complex and simple, heartwarming and detailed. It's complicated enough that so many hours later I still haven't completed most of the achievements or befriended most of the townsfolk, but it's simple and easy enough that I play it almost every night on the couch after work.

Concerned Ape has programmed a masterpiece; his story is just as heartwarming as the story he created. I anticipate each new release and I can't wait to see how far he takes this wonderful game. I rarely give games a perfect score, but this certainly deserves a ten out of ten."

Thank you.
I really hope the developers are able to find this review somehow.

We all have difficult times in our lives.

I started playing Stardew Valley in April 2021, which was not an easy moment in my life. Apart from the COVID pandemic, i was struggling with high anxiety/depression, college was online and the pressure, both from the university and myself, never stopped. It was hard. I cried a lot. But somehow i got through this.
I never played this kind of game before, sort of ""Harvest Moon""-like i guess. But i wanted to try something that i could just... Relax. Enjoy. Take a deep breath and calm my mind. Relieve the tension. Chill.

Stardew Valley, for me, was kind of... a life saver.
I'm still playing it (100h and counting) and the game still do what it did in the beginning: it's an incredibly charming and relaxing game, it's fun and it has likable characters, so far it has been an experience that i am very happy i gave it a shot.
It's one of my favorite indie games ever now. Right beside Bastion, Hollow Knight and Shovel Knight, other favorites of mine.

Stardew Valley calmed me when i needed most. And i will not forget that.

There isn't much to be said that hasn't already been said for this amazing game if you enjoyed the classic harvest moon type games you will absolutely 100% enjoy this. The game play seems fresh and fun even after clocking in over 60 hours, You won't want to quit, “Just 1 more day” then you realize that turned into 5 days and it's 4am and you have to sleep sometime.

This game, takes the old harvest moon concepts and tosses in a bit of Rune factory and a sprinkle of animal crossing leaving you with a sensational experience. Each day brings something fresh, There is over 25 different Npc's to interact with each day and each one brings their own charm and dialogue options depending on if you take the time to build up your friendships.

Your farm can be whatever you make it, You design what it looks like, how it runs, what you plant and what animals you choose to raise. The fishing can be a bit difficult to begin with but very rewarding and relaxing once you get the hang of it. On days you want something a bit different you can hop into the mine and find some rare gems, ores and minerals, Some that you can donate to the game's huge museum or use to upgrade your tools!

I can't praise this game enough, if your on the fence about purchasing this game or you think you should wait for a sale, Don't wait! This game was made by a single developer who deserves every single penny for all the obvious hard work and dedication. So go and farm your butt off!!!!"

This is a game that I have been looking forward to for at least 2 and a half years. I have wanted to have a game on the PC that had the elements of harvest moon (for the little bit I played of it), Animal crossing (<3) and Rune factory. I was super excited when I was approached by Leth (publishing manager at Chucklefish) at the beginning of December to help him and ConcernedApe (developer of the game) with bug testing and QA. 400+ hours later (off steam and on steam), I still love the game.

Farming. The farming is fantastic. It is to me one of the main elements of the game, and it's just a joy. Being able to design your farm any way you want it... yes please. Planning out what to buy every season, where to plant them, on top of the thrill of when you can harvest and reap on the gold... it's so enjoyable and addictive.

Fishing. The fishing is outstanding. From playing WoW and Runescape.. or any game with fishing, the fishing in Stardew Valley is so much fun. At first, the fishing is challenging, but as you progress your skill, you become a pro in no time.

Mining and combat is incredible. Going deeper into the mines can be tough, but if you're prepared with your food and weapon in hand, you can fend off the creatures and get your sweet ore/minerals/gems that you want to bring back to your house and possibly hoard. (Hi, I'm Bexy, and i'm a hoarder.)

Social interactions are great. Being able to become friends with the people in the town, and eventually being able to get into relationships with people and having a family with them.. what's not to like about that? And what's great is that it gives great replayability because you can have different saves with different spouses! The backstory for each of the characters too is so in depth and well thought out, you will be silly if you don't shed a tear maybe once or twice.

The actual main story is well rewarding, and once you ""complete"" it, you can still continue on your adventures and farming life with no problems, hell you might even discover new things afterwards, I sure as hell did!

Yes, I was a tester for the game. Yes, I have played for ridiculous amounts of hours. It may feel like i'm being a bit overzealous with this. However you have to remember, I was a tester. I tested the crap out of every aspect with this game, even though there were massive game breaking bugs, errors, glitches, crashes. I still love this game. I reported many a bug, and ConcernedApe was quick to fix them.

And that's the thing, not only is the game amazing, the developer is too. ConcernedApe works around the clock to make sure that bugs are fixed in quick time in order for us to have an amazing experience with this game. And that's true. The experience that you have with this game IS amazing.

Minutes playing turn into hours. Hours turn into ""oh no it's time to sleep"".
You will forget about time. You will forget about sleep. You will forget that dinner was about 5 hours ago but you couldn't' remember because you were too busy trying to fight off 12 bats that were clobbering you inside the mines while trying to gather that 1 diamond waaaaay in the back.

So yes, I without a shadow of a doubt 150% recommend this game to anyone that wants to ""escape"" for days on end with what I am classifying as my #1 Game of 2016."

INTRODUCTION

Stardew Valley.

I've heard a lot of things about this game. A lot of extremely positive things.

And I was doubtful. Was Stardew Valley really that good? I was afraid that people were just giving it attention because they didn't actually know what a good game was. And as insulting as it may sound, in my defense, uhhm....

Before buying the game I hadn't really seen what it looked like, or knew what it was about. I just knew that it was published by the same company, Chucklefish, that had developed Starbound. I had loved Starbound.. So I was playing completely spoiler free. Haven't watched any videos, no tips & tricks, just the information of a billion recommended reviews stuffed into my head.

So I bought Stardew Valley, and had pretty high expectations. If a game received THAT much popularity, it should be seriously good, right?



Plop. Into the world of Stardew Valley.

You completely start from the bottom, trailing after a tragedy and responsibility that's struck. A farm, barely any money, and the mystery of a town left in your hands. Whew. That's really a lot when you think about it.


Boy, did I NOT know what I was getting myself into.


At first, I was mesmorized. Or maybe lost is a better word. The beginning's all new and immersive, and the middle... kind of leaves you stuck. But, this is because I was impatient with the game. I went in wanting to finish it asap. However, I realized this game is NOT simply for you to buy and finish. It's something else... entirely.

The thing with Stardew Valley, It's all about exploration and management. Discovering and figuring out secrets and a beautiful story was amazing. Creative mechanics and powerful creativity had combined to produce a fabulous well-formed game that leaves a sweet taste in your mouth, and I'm going to tell you right now... it's totally addicting.

I bought the game a few days ago, and literally have played it all day since. I've NEVER done that with a game before. I found myself as a kid in a candy shop, gaping at all the different flavors, and being able to savor them all. And now, in Year 3 of the game.. I still have a lot more to discover.



Compared to others, I've only played around 130 hours of the game thus far. Buy Stardew Valley. You really won't regret it. This game is beautiful. The music is whimsically lifting, and the soundtrack is wonderful. It's a work of art. You will find yourself falling in love with the characters, and the daily routine of being a farmer who restores the life around people, and who changes everyone for the better. It's so relaxing, so addicting, and so much fun. I have played games for years, played games with far more hours than I have with Stardew Valley- and yet, I always turn to Stardew Valley first. Why? It's amazing. It offers something to everyone.

The game rewards for the hard-working. Stardew Valley is a game where you really have to manage things, yet, it allows you to explore the whole art of it. Work hard as you play the game, and there are sweet rewards. And I'm talking about rewards sweeter than all the candy in that candy shop.

Here's the thing: you can take two routes with Stardew Valley. You can either take the money route and become rich and miss half the game, or you can immerse yourself in exploring the town and what the game has to offer, but with also missing the point that Stardew is a management farming game.

Or, you can successfully find the balance between both. But how?

Stardew Valley allows you to store multiple accounts, which is fantastic. I recommend exploring with your first account, and learning the ropes. You seriously won't know anything yet, and will be like ""OMFG"" when you figure out there's a way that makes things one hundred times easier. After that, create a second account, and start figuring out farm management and what the game has to offer. This is a game in which you learn from your mistakes.

And now... I'm left in a spot where I can successfully thrive, and only continue to grow.



- Enchanting music that sings as you play

- A simple yet fun art design that you can't help but fall in love with

- Characters whom capture your heart

- A shambled town that begins to thrive

- Hidden secrets that you can't help but want to keep discovering

- Amazing challenges that leave you wanting more

- Brilliant originality, which is incredibly difficult to find

- A storyline that changes your perspective beautifully

- Lots of fun, and I mean .

- Mods created by the community to make your game more fun and immersive- however, I play without mods.

- IT FINALLY HAS MULTIPLAYER!



- As I said, the game rewards you for hard work. But only for hard work. It can be a grueling process, but it is extremely profitable. Those who don't like putting effort into a game won't enjoy Stardew Valley as much as other games.

- Time. Stardew Valley takes a lot of time to play through. It's a game you thoroughly have to enjoy and adventure out on.

- Repetitive. The game can be grueling. To reach certain goals you have to go through processes that you will SERIOUSLY hate. But, in the end, it's definitely worth the labor.




- I wish there would be more characters. Once you go through the storyline with everyone, there's not much lore left.

- More secrets and new areas, of course!



Stardew Valley offers a lot of things, and has changed the lives of many people. Perhaps in peace, wonder, open-mindedness, the game gives a lot. But I have one thing that's been bothering me for a long time... How in the damn world did one single person spit out a freaking awesome game?

Even though it's a farming game, which is commonly found everywhere, it's original with its own spins. It's extremely difficult to find a game that has such a captivating message that's been developed so well. Stardew Valley is a lot of fun and awe, and it really draws a blank in your mind.

Buy Stardew Valley. At first, it might seem mediocre... but keep playing. Trust me, the candies are still sweet. And they really only get sweeter."

If you look at the playtime above this review, you might be thinking to yourself... ""How on earth does one person invest 400 hours of their life into a game about farming?"" Well, it's a lot easier than you think.

Stardew Valley opens with our disillusioned protagonist slaving away at a corporate job, only to be reminded of a promise that they had made with their grandfather so many years ago. A promise of something to brighten the shadows when life becomes too dreary for them. Our stalwart protagonist waves goodbye to the grey walls of their office to board a train to Stardew Valley, an unknown paradise far away from the city. And it is here, where their life truly begins.

I can only wish that we all find our Stardew Valley someday. Yee-haw."

I convinced my brother to help me buy our mom a PS4 last Christmas so she could play Stardew Valley. She was playing the same Animal Crossing game on Wii for years, so getting her to try something new was risky.

After my brother showed her the TV apps, mom humored me and let me teach her how to play. She made a farm, and sort of caught on to using tools.

It’s August now. She’s logged over 500 hours into that farm. Her cellar is packed with kegs, the seashore is red with crab pots. She wields a flashy Return Scepter that I’ve never even gotten.

Spoiler free review, with a short and a longer version:

Buy this game if:

+ You're interested in farming, even though you're allowed to make that it isn't 100% of the core gameplay;
+ You were looking for a long, yet various and easy to be resumed game;
+ You're fond of pixelated indie games;
+ You can bear resource hunting and you have some patience, as there are some RPG and crafting gameplay;
+ You love games that are supported by modders and regularly updayed by the developer himself (Update 1.5 - see longer review part down below)

Don't buy the game if those above points aren't significant for you;






Longer version:
Let's see now the most important points, including the DLC, described in the 6th bullet point:

1-
Your grandpa, who lived the last part of his life is Stardew Valley has passed away and you as his nephew/niece have inherited a plot of land in Stardew Valley itself. Bored and saddened by the repetitive and dull life that you're spending working in a big firm (feel free to imagine it as Amazon/Nestlè)... you decide to accept the inheritance and embark in this new life and adventure.

2-
Even though clearing debris, pruning weeds, killing evil monsters and cutting trees is fun and necessary up to a certain point, you're not ""forced"" to keep farming 24/7, as the game is full of side activities who can be remunerative and of course fun, such as:
- tending to animals;
- mining;
- foraging;
- fishing:
- more...

3-
this means that besides customizing your own home, buildings and clothes there is a skill system, which can shape and improve the way on how you've decided to play the game;

4-
The NPCs are actually interesting and they're worth your time, socializing with them, helping them and confronting them on events, quests is always a good distraction and worth your time, as they'll be quite rewarding in terms of money, items and story progression in general, even though you're not forced to follow any particular path. Your actions have consequences that will also change the landscape and the city.

5-
I personally recommend Stardew Valley Expanded as a mod to be installed, feel free to check it on Nexusmods

6-
my biggest gripe with SV this free massive update from December 2020 was that there wasn't enough end-gameplay elements or goals to be reached. This update addressed completely these issues by adding a new whole area, distant from Stardew Valley, by adding new minerals, animals, crops, quests, weekly quests, npcs and much more, including many quality of life changes, which make the gameplay much smoother and fluid.

I spent three years building up hype, and I was still blown away.

If you enjoyed Harvest Moon, Rune Factory or Animal Crossing - then get this. It captures all the same things that made those games great, and it's the perfect game to play either casually or seriously. There are so many different ways to earn money and they're all developed and fun, the hardest part is choosing which one to spend your time doing.

The progression curve in the game is fantastic too. Every day you'll feel like you're making progress but there's still always something to work towards and you won't 'beat it' after a couple of hours earning as much money as possible, as there's always something to spend your money on. Even after 20 hours of playing, I feel like I'm nowhere near the endgame, and I could easily see myself playing through again and doing things differently. I'm even doing a playthrough on YouTube and the progress feels dramatically different even in its early stages.

I'm easily disappointed by games, so you can imagine my surprise when I was so impressed by a game made by one person. Congratulations, ConcernedApe, you've made one of the best games I've ever played."

Overview

Stardew Valley is a game that borrows heavily from similar titles in the Harvest Moon series. You start out in a rural town with nothing but a dilapidated house and crop fields that are more akin to the wilderness than a place to grow vegetables. The game is simple in its understanding: build a farm, make profits, live your life. What the game allows you to do makes it so much more layered. You're left with the freedom to explore the town, its residence, mold your farm into whatever you want it to be and on your own time. Sure, there are events to attend, festivals to see, men/women to romance and marry, kids to have, buildings to construct, fish to catch and weird little slimes to slay (Dragon Warrior, anyone?), but how and when you do those things is up to you.

In essence, the game offers you very similar things to do as a Harvest Moon game does: Build and upgrade your farm, plant crops, upgrade tools, mine in the never-ending dungeon for precious ore, go fishing, romance and get married...etc. While some of your old favorites are back, new aspects have been introduced as well, but I won't spoil those in this review. Let's just say there's a nice story that evolves over time.

The freedom to do as you please is what makes this game, and Harvest Moon in general, so enjoyable. It's a chance to mellow out, play at your own pace and still enjoy everything the game has to offer. What Stardew Valley does, it does right. It's charming, cute and feels rewarding, even when all you're doing is cuttings weeds. It doesn't pull any punches or try to be something its not; the developer had a goal in mind and Stardew Valley is a reflection of just that. You can feel the effort, the time and the devotion that went into this game over the years. Stardew Valley is a gem and worth looking at. If you loved Harvest Moon, you'll love Stardew Valley.

To date, Stardew Valley is a single player game, though the developer as mentioned some form of co-op or multiplayer availability in the future.











Overall, Stardew Valley is a pleasure. I haven't put a ton of time into it (yet), but I easily see that happening. It's fun, lighthearted and addictive. As I said earlier in this review, if you've ever played Harvest Moon, you'll enjoy Stardew Valley. It's worth checking out and I highly recommend it. This will easily become one of my most played games on my list. You won't be disappointed, so check it out!"

I was never interested in farming games. I’ve never played a Harvest Moon game or an Animal Crossing game, and never had any interest in them. The closest thing to a farming game I’ve ever played was Minecraft. I definitely would have never tried Stardew Valley if I wasn’t an achievement hunter and it didn’t have achievements.

But now I see what all the hype was about.

Stardew Valley is a game that is very easy to lose oneself into. There are many elements of the game that feel intimately relatable to real life, especially the game’s premise: you’re stuck at a soul-crushing corporate office job when your grandfather dies, leaving you an envelope telling you to open it only when you’ve reached your absolute limit and need something new. After a particularly bad day at work, you finally decide to open the envelope and find a deed to your grandfather’s farm on a far-off island, so you take the plunge and decide to move there. It is a very strong analogy to the game itself, where you, the player, are seeking escapism from your daily life and decide to take the plunge into this game, not knowing what else to expect.

In Stardew Valley, you will find your new home upon a sizable but absolutely trashed plot of land. As the days go by, you can clean up the land and discover hundreds of ways to make a profit with what you’ve been given, from buying seeds and planting crops, to raising animals, to fishing (by means of a surprisingly pleasant and addictive quicktime event), to foraging for wild food, and even to exploring a few combat-centric Zelda-style dungeons. But you’re not making money for its own sake – there are dozens of mysterious secrets scattered about the land, each with significant and game-changing rewards at the end, and you need to raise the money and resources to investigate them all. The game experience is going to be totally different for everybody depending on what game elements you are inspired to pursue first. Although you’ll assuredly be looking at a wiki in due time, it is deeply satisfying to go in blind and piece things together yourself for as long as you can.

Years consist of four months, each month being 28-day season. Some gameplay mechanics change with the seasons, particularly that certain crops only grow in certain seasons, and (almost) no crops grow in winter, so you’ll have to carefully consider what seeds to plant and when. Each day lasts about five minutes, and you’ve got to make sure you’re back in your house by 2AM, or else you’ll pass out and lose some money. The biggest way the game hooks you is the fact that your progress is only saved at the of a day – so if you’re eager to wake up in the morning and harvest your crops, it won’t mean anything unless you play the whole day through. A vicious cycle! I clocked 120 hours of this game in the first 2 weeks of playing. That’s how bad it is.

Another one of the game’s strengths is the cozy little community you live beside, with a population of about 25 people. The game does a wonderful job of making each character feel like their own entity, with their own daily routines and backstories and motivations. You’ll really get to know and love them. You can give gifts to characters to increase friendship level with them, unlocking character development cutscenes and important rewards. You can even date some of them (you can have 6 boyfriends and 6 girlfriends at once if you want, no joke; relationships are gender-indiscriminate) and then marry the character of your choice. The social aspect is sometimes a bit too real – you’ll feel the pain of rejection all too often – but that makes the successful relationships all the more heartwarming.

As for complaints: surprisingly, the game has some strange and baffling bugs, most of which are visual (like ice-skating horses), but some which affect gameplay, and a few known save-corruption bugs. I also felt consistently uncomfortable with the controls. If you're using the mouse, your cursor needs to always be in proximity of your character, or else you'll only aim at the tile in front of you, making it very easy to abruptly turn the wrong direction while working. And if you accidentally click the wrong tile, your character will turn to face it, changing the default direction you aim, compounding the problem. It can be infuriating, especially if it causes you to accidentally destroy crops. Also, I don't like how you can only talk to NPCs if you have a tool selected, and how you'll use a consumable item at the same time as opening a door if you have one selected. The controls could definitely use some additional polish.

Then there are the inventory controls. If you click on an inventory item, you pick it up and you can drop it in a different inventory slot. If you click on an inventory item with a storage box open, you will immediately transfer the item into (or out of) the box. Thus, it is impossible to organize the inventory with a storage box open. If you click on an inventory item while in a shop, . I can't tell you the amount of times I purchased 200 seeds, then immediately sold them again just because I tried to pick them up and put them in a different slot.

Also, I can’t help but feel the game should have even more content than it already does – perhaps more dungeons, a bigger map, and the ability to run more than one farm. But (as of this writing) the game is still in active development, including a co-op multiplayer patch in the works, and a lively modding community.

I give this game an 8/10. A wonderful example of what all those crappy Farmville mobile games would be like if they were actually balanced around gameplay and not milking the player with microtansactions and daily login bonuses. Despite some stupidly distracting bugs and annoying controls, it’s some simply wonderful escapism, and made me finally see the appeal in a farming game. It does get stale in time, but not before offering a huge amount of joy. For achievement hunting, it’ll easily take about 200 hours, especially blind… but if you’re like me, you’ll have it over with in a month or two. A huge thumbs-up."

Originally, when I was younger and inconsiderate, I pirated this game and sunk in at least 100 hours. Once I had my own money, I bought this game on Steam when the multiplayer update came out. I played a lot with my girlfriend at the time, and when we broke up, I stopped playing for a while and deleted the save. A few months later I was in a low place, so I bought this game on Switch and completed the story and got married, and had kids (so I sunk in a fair amount of hours ~200) It was the only thing motivating me to look after myself as I wanted to keep playing. As I recovered from that dark part of my life, I played less and less until a friend mentioned they wanted to play with me. So now I've been chilling on a farm with my friend through lockdown. This game as a whole has helped me through a lot, and has given me a bunch of great memories. I recommend Stardew Valley to anyone that likes Harvest Moon, farming sims in general, or just having a great time. The music is stellar and the art style is nice and fits with the game. Generally a great experience!!"

One thing I never realized until I finished the game is that you shouldn't rush it. I got everything done 8 years in game, found all the secrets, got 100% completionist on the tracker, found all the secret cutscenes, collected every hats, accessories, rings and weapons that are available in the game and have completed all endgame content. But when the credit starts rolling, all I feel is emptiness and a void that I can no longer fill up. This is a wonderful game that's just so inviting and calming to play, whether it is by myself or with a friend and now it is all over.

If you have got the time to spare, take my advice and enjoy the slow ride. Don't rush it and try to get everything with a guide early on, because all there is at the end is the credits."

I remember buying this game for my brother a few years back. Didn't think much of it at the time, but I thought it would be a nice gift for him. I remember seeing him playing it from time to time, the message indicating that he'd started playing it popping up on the corner of my screen. There was always a certain small pride in seeing that, because to me it meant that he was enjoying my gift.
Last September he committed suicide.
After everything had more or less settled down from that, I sat down and booted up his computer. All that was on there was Chrome, Steam, Word, and a few games. One of them, of course, was Stardew Valley.
He had played this game to pieces, clocking over 170 hours and owning practically everything the game had to offer. He had used every square inch to its maximum potential, and was making ridiculous amounts of cash. It was only then did I see just how much he loved his present. No other game he played quite captured his affection as much as this one. None of his friends really knew about it, however; it seems like he preferred to keep it to himself. Like it was his own little bit of heaven he could turn to whenever he wanted.

And because of that, I can't help but smile whenever I play this game.

I cannot recommend it enough; every bit of hard work the developer put into this masterpiece shows in every single aspect. The music is catchy and memorable (i'll ofetn find myself humming certain tunes from it), the world feels lived-in and natural, and the gameplay is incredibly laid back and enjoyable. It's hard to stop once I get invested in the game; minutes can easily turn into several hours. And now, with the multiplayer beta, I play for even longer with my friends, each of us dedicated to our desired jobs. Most of all, however, we're all just happy to be together."

I grew up playing Harvest Moon with my mom and it is one of my fondest memories. She would always buy me the new one for Christmas, and we would play it all day, filling notebooks full of recipes and discussing which person we hoped to marry. Although Stardew Valley has unmistakable similarities to Harvest Moon, it is a masterpiece in it's own right, one that is very dear to my heart after all those years playing with my mum.

Stardew Valley is complex and simple, heartwarming and detailed. It's complicated enough that so many hours later I still haven't completed most of the achievements or befriended most of the townsfolk, but it's simple and easy enough that I play it almost every night on the couch after work.

Concerned Ape has programmed a masterpiece; his story is just as heartwarming as the story he created. I anticipate each new release and I can't wait to see how far he takes this wonderful game. I rarely give games a perfect score, but this certainly deserves a ten out of ten."

Thank you.
I really hope the developers are able to find this review somehow.

We all have difficult times in our lives.

I started playing Stardew Valley in April 2021, which was not an easy moment in my life. Apart from the COVID pandemic, i was struggling with high anxiety/depression, college was online and the pressure, both from the university and myself, never stopped. It was hard. I cried a lot. But somehow i got through this.
I never played this kind of game before, sort of ""Harvest Moon""-like i guess. But i wanted to try something that i could just... Relax. Enjoy. Take a deep breath and calm my mind. Relieve the tension. Chill.

Stardew Valley, for me, was kind of... a life saver.
I'm still playing it (100h and counting) and the game still do what it did in the beginning: it's an incredibly charming and relaxing game, it's fun and it has likable characters, so far it has been an experience that i am very happy i gave it a shot.
It's one of my favorite indie games ever now. Right beside Bastion, Hollow Knight and Shovel Knight, other favorites of mine.

Stardew Valley calmed me when i needed most. And i will not forget that.

There isn't much to be said that hasn't already been said for this amazing game if you enjoyed the classic harvest moon type games you will absolutely 100% enjoy this. The game play seems fresh and fun even after clocking in over 60 hours, You won't want to quit, “Just 1 more day” then you realize that turned into 5 days and it's 4am and you have to sleep sometime.

This game, takes the old harvest moon concepts and tosses in a bit of Rune factory and a sprinkle of animal crossing leaving you with a sensational experience. Each day brings something fresh, There is over 25 different Npc's to interact with each day and each one brings their own charm and dialogue options depending on if you take the time to build up your friendships.

Your farm can be whatever you make it, You design what it looks like, how it runs, what you plant and what animals you choose to raise. The fishing can be a bit difficult to begin with but very rewarding and relaxing once you get the hang of it. On days you want something a bit different you can hop into the mine and find some rare gems, ores and minerals, Some that you can donate to the game's huge museum or use to upgrade your tools!

I can't praise this game enough, if your on the fence about purchasing this game or you think you should wait for a sale, Don't wait! This game was made by a single developer who deserves every single penny for all the obvious hard work and dedication. So go and farm your butt off!!!!"

This is a game that I have been looking forward to for at least 2 and a half years. I have wanted to have a game on the PC that had the elements of harvest moon (for the little bit I played of it), Animal crossing (<3) and Rune factory. I was super excited when I was approached by Leth (publishing manager at Chucklefish) at the beginning of December to help him and ConcernedApe (developer of the game) with bug testing and QA. 400+ hours later (off steam and on steam), I still love the game.

Farming. The farming is fantastic. It is to me one of the main elements of the game, and it's just a joy. Being able to design your farm any way you want it... yes please. Planning out what to buy every season, where to plant them, on top of the thrill of when you can harvest and reap on the gold... it's so enjoyable and addictive.

Fishing. The fishing is outstanding. From playing WoW and Runescape.. or any game with fishing, the fishing in Stardew Valley is so much fun. At first, the fishing is challenging, but as you progress your skill, you become a pro in no time.

Mining and combat is incredible. Going deeper into the mines can be tough, but if you're prepared with your food and weapon in hand, you can fend off the creatures and get your sweet ore/minerals/gems that you want to bring back to your house and possibly hoard. (Hi, I'm Bexy, and i'm a hoarder.)

Social interactions are great. Being able to become friends with the people in the town, and eventually being able to get into relationships with people and having a family with them.. what's not to like about that? And what's great is that it gives great replayability because you can have different saves with different spouses! The backstory for each of the characters too is so in depth and well thought out, you will be silly if you don't shed a tear maybe once or twice.

The actual main story is well rewarding, and once you ""complete"" it, you can still continue on your adventures and farming life with no problems, hell you might even discover new things afterwards, I sure as hell did!

Yes, I was a tester for the game. Yes, I have played for ridiculous amounts of hours. It may feel like i'm being a bit overzealous with this. However you have to remember, I was a tester. I tested the crap out of every aspect with this game, even though there were massive game breaking bugs, errors, glitches, crashes. I still love this game. I reported many a bug, and ConcernedApe was quick to fix them.

And that's the thing, not only is the game amazing, the developer is too. ConcernedApe works around the clock to make sure that bugs are fixed in quick time in order for us to have an amazing experience with this game. And that's true. The experience that you have with this game IS amazing.

Minutes playing turn into hours. Hours turn into ""oh no it's time to sleep"".
You will forget about time. You will forget about sleep. You will forget that dinner was about 5 hours ago but you couldn't' remember because you were too busy trying to fight off 12 bats that were clobbering you inside the mines while trying to gather that 1 diamond waaaaay in the back.

So yes, I without a shadow of a doubt 150% recommend this game to anyone that wants to ""escape"" for days on end with what I am classifying as my #1 Game of 2016."

INTRODUCTION

Stardew Valley.

I've heard a lot of things about this game. A lot of extremely positive things.

And I was doubtful. Was Stardew Valley really that good? I was afraid that people were just giving it attention because they didn't actually know what a good game was. And as insulting as it may sound, in my defense, uhhm....

Before buying the game I hadn't really seen what it looked like, or knew what it was about. I just knew that it was published by the same company, Chucklefish, that had developed Starbound. I had loved Starbound.. So I was playing completely spoiler free. Haven't watched any videos, no tips & tricks, just the information of a billion recommended reviews stuffed into my head.

So I bought Stardew Valley, and had pretty high expectations. If a game received THAT much popularity, it should be seriously good, right?



Plop. Into the world of Stardew Valley.

You completely start from the bottom, trailing after a tragedy and responsibility that's struck. A farm, barely any money, and the mystery of a town left in your hands. Whew. That's really a lot when you think about it.


Boy, did I NOT know what I was getting myself into.


At first, I was mesmorized. Or maybe lost is a better word. The beginning's all new and immersive, and the middle... kind of leaves you stuck. But, this is because I was impatient with the game. I went in wanting to finish it asap. However, I realized this game is NOT simply for you to buy and finish. It's something else... entirely.

The thing with Stardew Valley, It's all about exploration and management. Discovering and figuring out secrets and a beautiful story was amazing. Creative mechanics and powerful creativity had combined to produce a fabulous well-formed game that leaves a sweet taste in your mouth, and I'm going to tell you right now... it's totally addicting.

I bought the game a few days ago, and literally have played it all day since. I've NEVER done that with a game before. I found myself as a kid in a candy shop, gaping at all the different flavors, and being able to savor them all. And now, in Year 3 of the game.. I still have a lot more to discover.



Compared to others, I've only played around 130 hours of the game thus far. Buy Stardew Valley. You really won't regret it. This game is beautiful. The music is whimsically lifting, and the soundtrack is wonderful. It's a work of art. You will find yourself falling in love with the characters, and the daily routine of being a farmer who restores the life around people, and who changes everyone for the better. It's so relaxing, so addicting, and so much fun. I have played games for years, played games with far more hours than I have with Stardew Valley- and yet, I always turn to Stardew Valley first. Why? It's amazing. It offers something to everyone.

The game rewards for the hard-working. Stardew Valley is a game where you really have to manage things, yet, it allows you to explore the whole art of it. Work hard as you play the game, and there are sweet rewards. And I'm talking about rewards sweeter than all the candy in that candy shop.

Here's the thing: you can take two routes with Stardew Valley. You can either take the money route and become rich and miss half the game, or you can immerse yourself in exploring the town and what the game has to offer, but with also missing the point that Stardew is a management farming game.

Or, you can successfully find the balance between both. But how?

Stardew Valley allows you to store multiple accounts, which is fantastic. I recommend exploring with your first account, and learning the ropes. You seriously won't know anything yet, and will be like ""OMFG"" when you figure out there's a way that makes things one hundred times easier. After that, create a second account, and start figuring out farm management and what the game has to offer. This is a game in which you learn from your mistakes.

And now... I'm left in a spot where I can successfully thrive, and only continue to grow.



- Enchanting music that sings as you play

- A simple yet fun art design that you can't help but fall in love with

- Characters whom capture your heart

- A shambled town that begins to thrive

- Hidden secrets that you can't help but want to keep discovering

- Amazing challenges that leave you wanting more

- Brilliant originality, which is incredibly difficult to find

- A storyline that changes your perspective beautifully

- Lots of fun, and I mean .

- Mods created by the community to make your game more fun and immersive- however, I play without mods.

- IT FINALLY HAS MULTIPLAYER!



- As I said, the game rewards you for hard work. But only for hard work. It can be a grueling process, but it is extremely profitable. Those who don't like putting effort into a game won't enjoy Stardew Valley as much as other games.

- Time. Stardew Valley takes a lot of time to play through. It's a game you thoroughly have to enjoy and adventure out on.

- Repetitive. The game can be grueling. To reach certain goals you have to go through processes that you will SERIOUSLY hate. But, in the end, it's definitely worth the labor.




- I wish there would be more characters. Once you go through the storyline with everyone, there's not much lore left.

- More secrets and new areas, of course!



Stardew Valley offers a lot of things, and has changed the lives of many people. Perhaps in peace, wonder, open-mindedness, the game gives a lot. But I have one thing that's been bothering me for a long time... How in the damn world did one single person spit out a freaking awesome game?

Even though it's a farming game, which is commonly found everywhere, it's original with its own spins. It's extremely difficult to find a game that has such a captivating message that's been developed so well. Stardew Valley is a lot of fun and awe, and it really draws a blank in your mind.

Buy Stardew Valley. At first, it might seem mediocre... but keep playing. Trust me, the candies are still sweet. And they really only get sweeter."

baby animals bring smiles
a lovely garden adds some charm

if adventure is your thing
there are monsters in the mine

the town is chatty and populated

If you look at the playtime above this review, you might be thinking to yourself... ""How on earth does one person invest 400 hours of their life into a game about farming?"" Well, it's a lot easier than you think.

Stardew Valley opens with our disillusioned protagonist slaving away at a corporate job, only to be reminded of a promise that they had made with their grandfather so many years ago. A promise of something to brighten the shadows when life becomes too dreary for them. Our stalwart protagonist waves goodbye to the grey walls of their office to board a train to Stardew Valley, an unknown paradise far away from the city. And it is here, where their life truly begins.

I can only wish that we all find our Stardew Valley someday. Yee-haw."

I convinced my brother to help me buy our mom a PS4 last Christmas so she could play Stardew Valley. She was playing the same Animal Crossing game on Wii for years, so getting her to try something new was risky.

After my brother showed her the TV apps, mom humored me and let me teach her how to play. She made a farm, and sort of caught on to using tools.

It’s August now. She’s logged over 500 hours into that farm. Her cellar is packed with kegs, the seashore is red with crab pots. She wields a flashy Return Scepter that I’ve never even gotten.

Spoiler free review, with a short and a longer version:

Buy this game if:

+ You're interested in farming, even though you're allowed to make that it isn't 100% of the core gameplay;
+ You were looking for a long, yet various and easy to be resumed game;
+ You're fond of pixelated indie games;
+ You can bear resource hunting and you have some patience, as there are some RPG and crafting gameplay;
+ You love games that are supported by modders and regularly updayed by the developer himself (Update 1.5 - see longer review part down below)

Don't buy the game if those above points aren't significant for you;






Longer version:
Let's see now the most important points, including the DLC, described in the 6th bullet point:

1-
Your grandpa, who lived the last part of his life is Stardew Valley has passed away and you as his nephew/niece have inherited a plot of land in Stardew Valley itself. Bored and saddened by the repetitive and dull life that you're spending working in a big firm (feel free to imagine it as Amazon/Nestlè)... you decide to accept the inheritance and embark in this new life and adventure.

2-
Even though clearing debris, pruning weeds, killing evil monsters and cutting trees is fun and necessary up to a certain point, you're not ""forced"" to keep farming 24/7, as the game is full of side activities who can be remunerative and of course fun, such as:
- tending to animals;
- mining;
- foraging;
- fishing:

this means that besides customizing your own home, buildings and clothes there is a skill system, which can shape and improve the way on how you've decided to play the game;

The NPCs are actually interesting and they're worth your time, socializing with them, helping them and confronting them on events, quests is always a good distraction and worth your time, as they'll be quite rewarding in terms of money, items and story progression in general, even though you're not forced to follow any particular path. Your actions have consequences that will also change the landscape and the city.

I personally recommend Stardew Valley Expanded as a mod to be installed, feel free to check it on Nexusmods

my biggest gripe with SV this free massive update from December 2020 was that there wasn't enough end-gameplay elements or goals to be reached. This update addressed completely these issues by adding a new whole area, distant from Stardew Valley, by adding new minerals, animals, crops, quests, weekly quests, npcs and much more, including many quality of life changes, which make the gameplay much smoother and fluid.

I spent three years building up hype, and I was still blown away.

If you enjoyed Harvest Moon, Rune Factory or Animal Crossing - then get this. It captures all the same things that made those games great, and it's the perfect game to play either casually or seriously. There are so many different ways to earn money and they're all developed and fun, the hardest part is choosing which one to spend your time doing.

The progression curve in the game is fantastic too. Every day you'll feel like you're making progress but there's still always something to work towards and you won't 'beat it' after a couple of hours earning as much money as possible, as there's always something to spend your money on. Even after 20 hours of playing, I feel like I'm nowhere near the endgame, and I could easily see myself playing through again and doing things differently. I'm even doing a playthrough on YouTube and the progress feels dramatically different even in its early stages.

I'm easily disappointed by games, so you can imagine my surprise when I was so impressed by a game made by one person. Congratulations, ConcernedApe, you've made one of the best games I've ever played."

Overview

Stardew Valley is a game that borrows heavily from similar titles in the Harvest Moon series. You start out in a rural town with nothing but a dilapidated house and crop fields that are more akin to the wilderness than a place to grow vegetables. The game is simple in its understanding: build a farm, make profits, live your life. What the game allows you to do makes it so much more layered. You're left with the freedom to explore the town, its residence, mold your farm into whatever you want it to be and on your own time. Sure, there are events to attend, festivals to see, men/women to romance and marry, kids to have, buildings to construct, fish to catch and weird little slimes to slay (Dragon Warrior, anyone?), but how and when you do those things is up to you.

In essence, the game offers you very similar things to do as a Harvest Moon game does: Build and upgrade your farm, plant crops, upgrade tools, mine in the never-ending dungeon for precious ore, go fishing, romance and get married...etc. While some of your old favorites are back, new aspects have been introduced as well, but I won't spoil those in this review. Let's just say there's a nice story that evolves over time.

The freedom to do as you please is what makes this game, and Harvest Moon in general, so enjoyable. It's a chance to mellow out, play at your own pace and still enjoy everything the game has to offer. What Stardew Valley does, it does right. It's charming, cute and feels rewarding, even when all you're doing is cuttings weeds. It doesn't pull any punches or try to be something its not; the developer had a goal in mind and Stardew Valley is a reflection of just that. You can feel the effort, the time and the devotion that went into this game over the years. Stardew Valley is a gem and worth looking at. If you loved Harvest Moon, you'll love Stardew Valley.

To date, Stardew Valley is a single player game, though the developer as mentioned some form of co-op or multiplayer availability in the future.











Overall, Stardew Valley is a pleasure. I haven't put a ton of time into it (yet), but I easily see that happening. It's fun, lighthearted and addictive. As I said earlier in this review, if you've ever played Harvest Moon, you'll enjoy Stardew Valley. It's worth checking out and I highly recommend it. This will easily become one of my most played games on my list. You won't be disappointed, so check it out!"

I was never interested in farming games. I’ve never played a Harvest Moon game or an Animal Crossing game, and never had any interest in them. The closest thing to a farming game I’ve ever played was Minecraft. I definitely would have never tried Stardew Valley if I wasn’t an achievement hunter and it didn’t have achievements.

But now I see what all the hype was about.

Stardew Valley is a game that is very easy to lose oneself into. There are many elements of the game that feel intimately relatable to real life, especially the game’s premise: you’re stuck at a soul-crushing corporate office job when your grandfather dies, leaving you an envelope telling you to open it only when you’ve reached your absolute limit and need something new. After a particularly bad day at work, you finally decide to open the envelope and find a deed to your grandfather’s farm on a far-off island, so you take the plunge and decide to move there. It is a very strong analogy to the game itself, where you, the player, are seeking escapism from your daily life and decide to take the plunge into this game, not knowing what else to expect.

In Stardew Valley, you will find your new home upon a sizable but absolutely trashed plot of land. As the days go by, you can clean up the land and discover hundreds of ways to make a profit with what you’ve been given, from buying seeds and planting crops, to raising animals, to fishing (by means of a surprisingly pleasant and addictive quicktime event), to foraging for wild food, and even to exploring a few combat-centric Zelda-style dungeons. But you’re not making money for its own sake – there are dozens of mysterious secrets scattered about the land, each with significant and game-changing rewards at the end, and you need to raise the money and resources to investigate them all. The game experience is going to be totally different for everybody depending on what game elements you are inspired to pursue first. Although you’ll assuredly be looking at a wiki in due time, it is deeply satisfying to go in blind and piece things together yourself for as long as you can.

Years consist of four months, each month being 28-day season. Some gameplay mechanics change with the seasons, particularly that certain crops only grow in certain seasons, and (almost) no crops grow in winter, so you’ll have to carefully consider what seeds to plant and when. Each day lasts about five minutes, and you’ve got to make sure you’re back in your house by 2AM, or else you’ll pass out and lose some money. The biggest way the game hooks you is the fact that your progress is only saved at the of a day – so if you’re eager to wake up in the morning and harvest your crops, it won’t mean anything unless you play the whole day through. A vicious cycle! I clocked 120 hours of this game in the first 2 weeks of playing. That’s how bad it is.

Another one of the game’s strengths is the cozy little community you live beside, with a population of about 25 people. The game does a wonderful job of making each character feel like their own entity, with their own daily routines and backstories and motivations. You’ll really get to know and love them. You can give gifts to characters to increase friendship level with them, unlocking character development cutscenes and important rewards. You can even date some of them (you can have 6 boyfriends and 6 girlfriends at once if you want, no joke; relationships are gender-indiscriminate) and then marry the character of your choice. The social aspect is sometimes a bit too real – you’ll feel the pain of rejection all too often – but that makes the successful relationships all the more heartwarming.

As for complaints: surprisingly, the game has some strange and baffling bugs, most of which are visual (like ice-skating horses), but some which affect gameplay, and a few known save-corruption bugs. I also felt consistently uncomfortable with the controls. If you're using the mouse, your cursor needs to always be in proximity of your character, or else you'll only aim at the tile in front of you, making it very easy to abruptly turn the wrong direction while working. And if you accidentally click the wrong tile, your character will turn to face it, changing the default direction you aim, compounding the problem. It can be infuriating, especially if it causes you to accidentally destroy crops. Also, I don't like how you can only talk to NPCs if you have a tool selected, and how you'll use a consumable item at the same time as opening a door if you have one selected. The controls could definitely use some additional polish.

Then there are the inventory controls. If you click on an inventory item, you pick it up and you can drop it in a different inventory slot. If you click on an inventory item with a storage box open, you will immediately transfer the item into (or out of) the box. Thus, it is impossible to organize the inventory with a storage box open. If you click on an inventory item while in a shop, . I can't tell you the amount of times I purchased 200 seeds, then immediately sold them again just because I tried to pick them up and put them in a different slot.

Also, I can’t help but feel the game should have even more content than it already does – perhaps more dungeons, a bigger map, and the ability to run more than one farm. But (as of this writing) the game is still in active development, including a co-op multiplayer patch in the works, and a lively modding community.

I give this game an 8/10. A wonderful example of what all those crappy Farmville mobile games would be like if they were actually balanced around gameplay and not milking the player with microtansactions and daily login bonuses. Despite some stupidly distracting bugs and annoying controls, it’s some simply wonderful escapism, and made me finally see the appeal in a farming game. It does get stale in time, but not before offering a huge amount of joy. For achievement hunting, it’ll easily take about 200 hours, especially blind… but if you’re like me, you’ll have it over with in a month or two. A huge thumbs-up."

Originally, when I was younger and inconsiderate, I pirated this game and sunk in at least 100 hours. Once I had my own money, I bought this game on Steam when the multiplayer update came out. I played a lot with my girlfriend at the time, and when we broke up, I stopped playing for a while and deleted the save. A few months later I was in a low place, so I bought this game on Switch and completed the story and got married, and had kids (so I sunk in a fair amount of hours ~200) It was the only thing motivating me to look after myself as I wanted to keep playing. As I recovered from that dark part of my life, I played less and less until a friend mentioned they wanted to play with me. So now I've been chilling on a farm with my friend through lockdown. This game as a whole has helped me through a lot, and has given me a bunch of great memories. I recommend Stardew Valley to anyone that likes Harvest Moon, farming sims in general, or just having a great time. The music is stellar and the art style is nice and fits with the game. Generally a great experience!!"

I grew up playing Harvest Moon on the SNES. My parents probably rented the game a dozen+ times before putting up the money to just buy the damn game. My brother and I dumped hours, and hours, and hours into that game. Beating it multiple times to see some of the different endings.


A few years ago, for the first time, a game was released that bested the original Harvest Moon. That game is obviously Fortnite. JK


Stardew Valley is such a good spiritual successor, that it beats the original hand over fist. It's entirely it's own game, while nodding its head to what I assume is its source inspiration. It exceeded my expectations by a lot, and it continues to be improved on again and again.


This game has a lot of replayability (just ask my wife who has nearly 1000 hours logged by now). Between different relationships, different focuses, different game altering choices, and different property layouts and designs. There's enough content to keep you entertained and coming back for a very long time.


It might seem minor, but the games soundtrack is probably one of the best, if not THE best out there. Chrono Cross was my former favorite, but only Stardew Valley has led to me purchasing the soundtrack on digital and two different vinyl releases (okay, one of those was a gift). It keeps the game from getting as monotonous as it MIGHT otherwise get sometimes. Its similar to the Tetris song. After enough playing, the music is ingrained in my soul. Lmao


Gorgeous pixel graphics. Amazing variety and loads of charm. The creator clearly has a deep passion for this game and it shows in nearly every way.


This game deserves so much more money and appreciation than it gets.


11/10 - stop ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ around and buy the game already. I dont care if you find farming boring.

One thing I never realized until I finished the game is that you shouldn't rush it. I got everything done 8 years in game, found all the secrets, got 100% completionist on the tracker, found all the secret cutscenes, collected every hats, accessories, rings and weapons that are available in the game and have completed all endgame content. But when the credit starts rolling, all I feel is emptiness and a void that I can no longer fill up. This is a wonderful game that's just so inviting and calming to play, whether it is by myself or with a friend and now it is all over.

If you have got the time to spare, take my advice and enjoy the slow ride. Don't rush it and try to get everything with a guide early on, because all there is at the end is the credits."

I remember buying this game for my brother a few years back. Didn't think much of it at the time, but I thought it would be a nice gift for him. I remember seeing him playing it from time to time, the message indicating that he'd started playing it popping up on the corner of my screen. There was always a certain small pride in seeing that, because to me it meant that he was enjoying my gift.
Last September he committed suicide.
After everything had more or less settled down from that, I sat down and booted up his computer. All that was on there was Chrome, Steam, Word, and a few games. One of them, of course, was Stardew Valley.
He had played this game to pieces, clocking over 170 hours and owning practically everything the game had to offer. He had used every square inch to its maximum potential, and was making ridiculous amounts of cash. It was only then did I see just how much he loved his present. No other game he played quite captured his affection as much as this one. None of his friends really knew about it, however; it seems like he preferred to keep it to himself. Like it was his own little bit of heaven he could turn to whenever he wanted.

And because of that, I can't help but smile whenever I play this game.

I cannot recommend it enough; every bit of hard work the developer put into this masterpiece shows in every single aspect. The music is catchy and memorable (i'll ofetn find myself humming certain tunes from it), the world feels lived-in and natural, and the gameplay is incredibly laid back and enjoyable. It's hard to stop once I get invested in the game; minutes can easily turn into several hours. And now, with the multiplayer beta, I play for even longer with my friends, each of us dedicated to our desired jobs. Most of all, however, we're all just happy to be together."

Although Stardew Valley has unmistakable similarities to Harvest Moon, it is a masterpiece in it's own right, one that is very dear to my heart after all those years playing with my mum.

Stardew Valley is complex and simple, heartwarming and detailed. It's complicated enough that so many hours later I still haven't completed most of the achievements or befriended most of the townsfolk, but it's simple and easy enough that I play it almost every night on the couch after work.

Concerned Ape has programmed a masterpiece; his story is just as heartwarming as the story he created. I anticipate each new release and I can't wait to see how far he takes this wonderful game. I rarely give games a perfect score, but this certainly deserves a ten out of ten."

Thank you.
I really hope the developers are able to find this review somehow.

We all have difficult times in our lives.

I started playing Stardew Valley in April 2021, which was not an easy moment in my life. Apart from the COVID pandemic, i was struggling with high anxiety/depression, college was online and the pressure, both from the university and myself, never stopped. It was hard. I cried a lot. But somehow i got through this.
I never played this kind of game before, sort of ""Harvest Moon""-like i guess. But i wanted to try something that i could just... Relax. Enjoy. Take a deep breath and calm my mind. Relieve the tension. Chill.

Stardew Valley, for me, was kind of... a life saver.
I'm still playing it (100h and counting) and the game still do what it did in the beginning: it's an incredibly charming and relaxing game, it's fun and it has likable characters, so far it has been an experience that i am very happy i gave it a shot.
It's one of my favorite indie games ever now. Right beside Bastion, Hollow Knight and Shovel Knight, other favorites of mine.

Stardew Valley calmed me when i needed most. And i will not forget that.

There isn't much to be said that hasn't already been said for this amazing game if you enjoyed the classic harvest moon type games you will absolutely 100% enjoy this. The game play seems fresh and fun even after clocking in over 60 hours, You won't want to quit, “Just 1 more day” then you realize that turned into 5 days and it's 4am and you have to sleep sometime.

This game, takes the old harvest moon concepts and tosses in a bit of Rune factory and a sprinkle of animal crossing leaving you with a sensational experience. Each day brings something fresh, There is over 25 different Npc's to interact with each day and each one brings their own charm and dialogue options depending on if you take the time to build up your friendships.

Your farm can be whatever you make it, You design what it looks like, how it runs, what you plant and what animals you choose to raise. The fishing can be a bit difficult to begin with but very rewarding and relaxing once you get the hang of it. On days you want something a bit different you can hop into the mine and find some rare gems, ores and minerals, Some that you can donate to the game's huge museum or use to upgrade your tools!

I can't praise this game enough, if your on the fence about purchasing this game or you think you should wait for a sale, Don't wait! This game was made by a single developer who deserves every single penny for all the obvious hard work and dedication. So go and farm your butt off!!!!"

This is a game that I have been looking forward to for at least 2 and a half years. I have wanted to have a game on the PC that had the elements of harvest moon (for the little bit I played of it), Animal crossing (<3) and Rune factory. I was super excited when I was approached by Leth (publishing manager at Chucklefish) at the beginning of December to help him and ConcernedApe (developer of the game) with bug testing and QA. 400+ hours later (off steam and on steam), I still love the game.

Farming. The farming is fantastic. It is to me one of the main elements of the game, and it's just a joy. Being able to design your farm any way you want it... yes please. Planning out what to buy every season, where to plant them, on top of the thrill of when you can harvest and reap on the gold... it's so enjoyable and addictive.

Fishing. The fishing is outstanding. From playing WoW and Runescape.. or any game with fishing, the fishing in Stardew Valley is so much fun. At first, the fishing is challenging, but as you progress your skill, you become a pro in no time.

Mining and combat is incredible. Going deeper into the mines can be tough, but if you're prepared with your food and weapon in hand, you can fend off the creatures and get your sweet ore/minerals/gems that you want to bring back to your house and possibly hoard. (Hi, I'm Bexy, and i'm a hoarder.)

Social interactions are great. Being able to become friends with the people in the town, and eventually being able to get into relationships with people and having a family with them.. what's not to like about that? And what's great is that it gives great replayability because you can have different saves with different spouses! The backstory for each of the characters too is so in depth and well thought out, you will be silly if you don't shed a tear maybe once or twice.

The actual main story is well rewarding, and once you ""complete"" it, you can still continue on your adventures and farming life with no problems, hell you might even discover new things afterwards, I sure as hell did!

Yes, I was a tester for the game. Yes, I have played for ridiculous amounts of hours. It may feel like i'm being a bit overzealous with this. However you have to remember, I was a tester. I tested the crap out of every aspect with this game, even though there were massive game breaking bugs, errors, glitches, crashes. I still love this game. I reported many a bug, and ConcernedApe was quick to fix them.

And that's the thing, not only is the game amazing, the developer is too. ConcernedApe works around the clock to make sure that bugs are fixed in quick time in order for us to have an amazing experience with this game. And that's true. The experience that you have with this game IS amazing.

Minutes playing turn into hours. Hours turn into ""oh no it's time to sleep"".
You will forget about time. You will forget about sleep. You will forget that dinner was about 5 hours ago but you couldn't' remember because you were too busy trying to fight off 12 bats that were clobbering you inside the mines while trying to gather that 1 diamond waaaaay in the back.

So yes, I without a shadow of a doubt 150% recommend this game to anyone that wants to ""escape"" for days on end with what I am classifying as my #1 Game of 2016."

INTRODUCTION

Stardew Valley.

I've heard a lot of things about this game. A lot of extremely positive things.

And I was doubtful. Was Stardew Valley really that good? I was afraid that people were just giving it attention because they didn't actually know what a good game was. And as insulting as it may sound, in my defense, uhhm....

Before buying the game I hadn't really seen what it looked like, or knew what it was about. I just knew that it was published by the same company, Chucklefish, that had developed Starbound. I had loved Starbound.. So I was playing completely spoiler free. Haven't watched any videos, no tips & tricks, just the information of a billion recommended reviews stuffed into my head.

So I bought Stardew Valley, and had pretty high expectations. If a game received THAT much popularity, it should be seriously good, right?



Plop. Into the world of Stardew Valley.

You completely start from the bottom, trailing after a tragedy and responsibility that's struck. A farm, barely any money, and the mystery of a town left in your hands. Whew. That's really a lot when you think about it.


Boy, did I NOT know what I was getting myself into.


At first, I was mesmorized. Or maybe lost is a better word. The beginning's all new and immersive, and the middle... kind of leaves you stuck. But, this is because I was impatient with the game. I went in wanting to finish it asap. However, I realized this game is NOT simply for you to buy and finish. It's something else... entirely.

The thing with Stardew Valley, It's all about exploration and management. Discovering and figuring out secrets and a beautiful story was amazing. Creative mechanics and powerful creativity had combined to produce a fabulous well-formed game that leaves a sweet taste in your mouth, and I'm going to tell you right now... it's totally addicting.

I bought the game a few days ago, and literally have played it all day since. I've NEVER done that with a game before. I found myself as a kid in a candy shop, gaping at all the different flavors, and being able to savor them all. And now, in Year 3 of the game.. I still have a lot more to discover.



Compared to others, I've only played around 130 hours of the game thus far. Buy Stardew Valley. You really won't regret it. This game is beautiful. The music is whimsically lifting, and the soundtrack is wonderful. It's a work of art. You will find yourself falling in love with the characters, and the daily routine of being a farmer who restores the life around people, and who changes everyone for the better. It's so relaxing, so addicting, and so much fun. I have played games for years, played games with far more hours than I have with Stardew Valley- and yet, I always turn to Stardew Valley first. Why? It's amazing. It offers something to everyone.

The game rewards for the hard-working. Stardew Valley is a game where you really have to manage things, yet, it allows you to explore the whole art of it. Work hard as you play the game, and there are sweet rewards. And I'm talking about rewards sweeter than all the candy in that candy shop.

Here's the thing: you can take two routes with Stardew Valley. You can either take the money route and become rich and miss half the game, or you can immerse yourself in exploring the town and what the game has to offer, but with also missing the point that Stardew is a management farming game.

Or, you can successfully find the balance between both. But how?

Stardew Valley allows you to store multiple accounts, which is fantastic. I recommend exploring with your first account, and learning the ropes. You seriously won't know anything yet, and will be like ""OMFG"" when you figure out there's a way that makes things one hundred times easier. After that, create a second account, and start figuring out farm management and what the game has to offer. This is a game in which you learn from your mistakes.

And now... I'm left in a spot where I can successfully thrive, and only continue to grow.



- Enchanting music that sings as you play

- A simple yet fun art design that you can't help but fall in love with

- Characters whom capture your heart

- A shambled town that begins to thrive

- Hidden secrets that you can't help but want to keep discovering

- Amazing challenges that leave you wanting more

- Brilliant originality, which is incredibly difficult to find

- A storyline that changes your perspective beautifully

- Lots of fun, and I mean .

- Mods created by the community to make your game more fun and immersive- however, I play without mods.

- IT FINALLY HAS MULTIPLAYER!



- As I said, the game rewards you for hard work. But only for hard work. It can be a grueling process, but it is extremely profitable. Those who don't like putting effort into a game won't enjoy Stardew Valley as much as other games.

- Time. Stardew Valley takes a lot of time to play through. It's a game you thoroughly have to enjoy and adventure out on.

- Repetitive. The game can be grueling. To reach certain goals you have to go through processes that you will SERIOUSLY hate. But, in the end, it's definitely worth the labor.




- I wish there would be more characters. Once you go through the storyline with everyone, there's not much lore left.

- More secrets and new areas, of course!



Stardew Valley offers a lot of things, and has changed the lives of many people. Perhaps in peace, wonder, open-mindedness, the game gives a lot. But I have one thing that's been bothering me for a long time... How in the damn world did one single person spit out a freaking awesome game?

Even though it's a farming game, which is commonly found everywhere, it's original with its own spins. It's extremely difficult to find a game that has such a captivating message that's been developed so well. Stardew Valley is a lot of fun and awe, and it really draws a blank in your mind.

Buy Stardew Valley. At first, it might seem mediocre... but keep playing. Trust me, the candies are still sweet. And they really only get sweeter."

baby animals bring smiles
a lovely garden adds some charm

if adventure is your thing
there are monsters in the mine
or travel to a far off land
either one is totally fine

the town is chatty and populated

maybe a wedding will be fated

If you look at the playtime above this review, you might be thinking to yourself... ""How on earth does one person invest 400 hours of their life into a game about farming?"" Well, it's a lot easier than you think.

Stardew Valley opens with our disillusioned protagonist slaving away at a corporate job, only to be reminded of a promise that they had made with their grandfather so many years ago. A promise of something to brighten the shadows when life becomes too dreary for them. Our stalwart protagonist waves goodbye to the grey walls of their office to board a train to Stardew Valley, an unknown paradise far away from the city. And it is here, where their life truly begins.

I can only wish that we all find our Stardew Valley someday. Yee-haw."

I convinced my brother to help me buy our mom a PS4 last Christmas so she could play Stardew Valley. She was playing the same Animal Crossing game on Wii for years, so getting her to try something new was risky.

After my brother showed her the TV apps, mom humored me and let me teach her how to play. She made a farm, and sort of caught on to using tools.

It’s August now. She’s logged over 500 hours into that farm. Her cellar is packed with kegs, the seashore is red with crab pots. She wields a flashy Return Scepter that I’ve never even gotten.

Spoiler free review, with a short and a longer version:

Buy this game if:

+ You're interested in farming, even though you're allowed to make that it isn't 100% of the core gameplay;
+ You were looking for a long, yet various and easy to be resumed game;
+ You're fond of pixelated indie games;
+ You can bear resource hunting and you have some patience, as there are some RPG and crafting gameplay;
+ You love games that are supported by modders and regularly updayed by the developer himself (Update 1.5 - see longer review part down below)

Don't buy the game if those above points aren't significant for you;






Longer version:
Let's see now the most important points, including the DLC, described in the 6th bullet point:

1-
Your grandpa, who lived the last part of his life is Stardew Valley has passed away and you as his nephew/niece have inherited a plot of land in Stardew Valley itself. Bored and saddened by the repetitive and dull life that you're spending working in a big firm (feel free to imagine it as Amazon/Nestlè)... you decide to accept the inheritance and embark in this new life and adventure.

2-
Even though clearing debris, pruning weeds, killing evil monsters and cutting trees is fun and necessary up to a certain point, you're not ""forced"" to keep farming 24/7, as the game is full of side activities who can be remunerative and of course fun, such as:
- tending to animals;
- mining;
- foraging;
- fishing:
- more...

3-
this means that besides customizing your own home, buildings and clothes there is a skill system, which can shape and improve the way on how you've decided to play the game;

4-
The NPCs are actually interesting and they're worth your time, socializing with them, helping them and confronting them on events, quests is always a good distraction and worth your time, as they'll be quite rewarding in terms of money, items and story progression in general, even though you're not forced to follow any particular path. Your actions have consequences that will also change the landscape and the city.

5-
I personally recommend Stardew Valley Expanded as a mod to be installed, feel free to check it on Nexusmods

6-
my biggest gripe with SV this free massive update from December 2020 was that there wasn't enough end-gameplay elements or goals to be reached. This update addressed completely these issues by adding a new whole area, distant from Stardew Valley, by adding new minerals, animals, crops, quests, weekly quests, npcs and much more, including many quality of life changes, which make the gameplay much smoother and fluid.

Thanks for reading and for bearing up with me, leave a comment below if you have any questions or observations, have an amazing day/night, feel free to follow my other reviews at:"

I spent three years building up hype, and I was still blown away.

If you enjoyed Harvest Moon, Rune Factory or Animal Crossing - then get this. It captures all the same things that made those games great, and it's the perfect game to play either casually or seriously. There are so many different ways to earn money and they're all developed and fun, the hardest part is choosing which one to spend your time doing.

The progression curve in the game is fantastic too. Every day you'll feel like you're making progress but there's still always something to work towards and you won't 'beat it' after a couple of hours earning as much money as possible, as there's always something to spend your money on. Even after 20 hours of playing, I feel like I'm nowhere near the endgame, and I could easily see myself playing through again and doing things differently. I'm even doing a playthrough on YouTube and the progress feels dramatically different even in its early stages.

I'm easily disappointed by games, so you can imagine my surprise when I was so impressed by a game made by one person. Congratulations, ConcernedApe, you've made one of the best games I've ever played."

Overview

Stardew Valley is a game that borrows heavily from similar titles in the Harvest Moon series. You start out in a rural town with nothing but a dilapidated house and crop fields that are more akin to the wilderness than a place to grow vegetables. The game is simple in its understanding: build a farm, make profits, live your life. What the game allows you to do makes it so much more layered. You're left with the freedom to explore the town, its residence, mold your farm into whatever you want it to be and on your own time. Sure, there are events to attend, festivals to see, men/women to romance and marry, kids to have, buildings to construct, fish to catch and weird little slimes to slay (Dragon Warrior, anyone?), but how and when you do those things is up to you.

In essence, the game offers you very similar things to do as a Harvest Moon game does: Build and upgrade your farm, plant crops, upgrade tools, mine in the never-ending dungeon for precious ore, go fishing, romance and get married...etc. While some of your old favorites are back, new aspects have been introduced as well, but I won't spoil those in this review. Let's just say there's a nice story that evolves over time.

The freedom to do as you please is what makes this game, and Harvest Moon in general, so enjoyable. It's a chance to mellow out, play at your own pace and still enjoy everything the game has to offer. What Stardew Valley does, it does right. It's charming, cute and feels rewarding, even when all you're doing is cuttings weeds. It doesn't pull any punches or try to be something its not; the developer had a goal in mind and Stardew Valley is a reflection of just that. You can feel the effort, the time and the devotion that went into this game over the years. Stardew Valley is a gem and worth looking at. If you loved Harvest Moon, you'll love Stardew Valley.

To date, Stardew Valley is a single player game, though the developer as mentioned some form of co-op or multiplayer availability in the future.











Overall, Stardew Valley is a pleasure. I haven't put a ton of time into it (yet), but I easily see that happening. It's fun, lighthearted and addictive. As I said earlier in this review, if you've ever played Harvest Moon, you'll enjoy Stardew Valley. It's worth checking out and I highly recommend it. This will easily become one of my most played games on my list. You won't be disappointed, so check it out!"

It's winter, you have a weekend and you don't need to go anywhere. It's so peacefully quiet outside. You brewed yourself hot tea along with fragrant pastries. You make yourself comfortable by the warm fireplace wrapped in a blanket and play Stardew Valley. Your farm is wonderful. You are the happiest person."

I was never interested in farming games. I’ve never played a Harvest Moon game or an Animal Crossing game, and never had any interest in them. The closest thing to a farming game I’ve ever played was Minecraft. I definitely would have never tried Stardew Valley if I wasn’t an achievement hunter and it didn’t have achievements.

But now I see what all the hype was about.

Stardew Valley is a game that is very easy to lose oneself into. There are many elements of the game that feel intimately relatable to real life, especially the game’s premise: you’re stuck at a soul-crushing corporate office job when your grandfather dies, leaving you an envelope telling you to open it only when you’ve reached your absolute limit and need something new. After a particularly bad day at work, you finally decide to open the envelope and find a deed to your grandfather’s farm on a far-off island, so you take the plunge and decide to move there. It is a very strong analogy to the game itself, where you, the player, are seeking escapism from your daily life and decide to take the plunge into this game, not knowing what else to expect.

In Stardew Valley, you will find your new home upon a sizable but absolutely trashed plot of land. As the days go by, you can clean up the land and discover hundreds of ways to make a profit with what you’ve been given, from buying seeds and planting crops, to raising animals, to fishing (by means of a surprisingly pleasant and addictive quicktime event), to foraging for wild food, and even to exploring a few combat-centric Zelda-style dungeons. But you’re not making money for its own sake – there are dozens of mysterious secrets scattered about the land, each with significant and game-changing rewards at the end, and you need to raise the money and resources to investigate them all. The game experience is going to be totally different for everybody depending on what game elements you are inspired to pursue first. Although you’ll assuredly be looking at a wiki in due time, it is deeply satisfying to go in blind and piece things together yourself for as long as you can.

Years consist of four months, each month being 28-day season. Some gameplay mechanics change with the seasons, particularly that certain crops only grow in certain seasons, and (almost) no crops grow in winter, so you’ll have to carefully consider what seeds to plant and when. Each day lasts about five minutes, and you’ve got to make sure you’re back in your house by 2AM, or else you’ll pass out and lose some money. The biggest way the game hooks you is the fact that your progress is only saved at the of a day – so if you’re eager to wake up in the morning and harvest your crops, it won’t mean anything unless you play the whole day through. A vicious cycle! I clocked 120 hours of this game in the first 2 weeks of playing. That’s how bad it is.

Another one of the game’s strengths is the cozy little community you live beside, with a population of about 25 people. The game does a wonderful job of making each character feel like their own entity, with their own daily routines and backstories and motivations. You’ll really get to know and love them. You can give gifts to characters to increase friendship level with them, unlocking character development cutscenes and important rewards. You can even date some of them (you can have 6 boyfriends and 6 girlfriends at once if you want, no joke; relationships are gender-indiscriminate) and then marry the character of your choice. The social aspect is sometimes a bit too real – you’ll feel the pain of rejection all too often – but that makes the successful relationships all the more heartwarming.

As for complaints: surprisingly, the game has some strange and baffling bugs, most of which are visual (like ice-skating horses), but some which affect gameplay, and a few known save-corruption bugs. I also felt consistently uncomfortable with the controls. If you're using the mouse, your cursor needs to always be in proximity of your character, or else you'll only aim at the tile in front of you, making it very easy to abruptly turn the wrong direction while working. And if you accidentally click the wrong tile, your character will turn to face it, changing the default direction you aim, compounding the problem. It can be infuriating, especially if it causes you to accidentally destroy crops. Also, I don't like how you can only talk to NPCs if you have a tool selected, and how you'll use a consumable item at the same time as opening a door if you have one selected. The controls could definitely use some additional polish.

Then there are the inventory controls. If you click on an inventory item, you pick it up and you can drop it in a different inventory slot. If you click on an inventory item with a storage box open, you will immediately transfer the item into (or out of) the box. Thus, it is impossible to organize the inventory with a storage box open. If you click on an inventory item while in a shop, . I can't tell you the amount of times I purchased 200 seeds, then immediately sold them again just because I tried to pick them up and put them in a different slot.

Also, I can’t help but feel the game should have even more content than it already does – perhaps more dungeons, a bigger map, and the ability to run more than one farm. But (as of this writing) the game is still in active development, including a co-op multiplayer patch in the works, and a lively modding community.

I give this game an 8/10. A wonderful example of what all those crappy Farmville mobile games would be like if they were actually balanced around gameplay and not milking the player with microtansactions and daily login bonuses. Despite some stupidly distracting bugs and annoying controls, it’s some simply wonderful escapism, and made me finally see the appeal in a farming game. It does get stale in time, but not before offering a huge amount of joy. For achievement hunting, it’ll easily take about 200 hours, especially blind… but if you’re like me, you’ll have it over with in a month or two. A huge thumbs-up."

Originally, when I was younger and inconsiderate, I pirated this game and sunk in at least 100 hours. Once I had my own money, I bought this game on Steam when the multiplayer update came out. I played a lot with my girlfriend at the time, and when we broke up, I stopped playing for a while and deleted the save. A few months later I was in a low place, so I bought this game on Switch and completed the story and got married, and had kids (so I sunk in a fair amount of hours ~200) It was the only thing motivating me to look after myself as I wanted to keep playing. As I recovered from that dark part of my life, I played less and less until a friend mentioned they wanted to play with me. So now I've been chilling on a farm with my friend through lockdown. This game as a whole has helped me through a lot, and has given me a bunch of great memories. I recommend Stardew Valley to anyone that likes Harvest Moon, farming sims in general, or just having a great time. The music is stellar and the art style is nice and fits with the game. Generally a great experience!!"

I grew up playing Harvest Moon on the SNES. My parents probably rented the game a dozen+ times before putting up the money to just buy the damn game. My brother and I dumped hours, and hours, and hours into that game. Beating it multiple times to see some of the different endings.


A few years ago, for the first time, a game was released that bested the original Harvest Moon. That game is obviously Fortnite. JK


Stardew Valley is such a good spiritual successor, that it beats the original hand over fist. It's entirely it's own game, while nodding its head to what I assume is its source inspiration. It exceeded my expectations by a lot, and it continues to be improved on again and again.


This game has a lot of replayability (just ask my wife who has nearly 1000 hours logged by now). Between different relationships, different focuses, different game altering choices, and different property layouts and designs. There's enough content to keep you entertained and coming back for a very long time.


It might seem minor, but the games soundtrack is probably one of the best, if not THE best out there. Chrono Cross was my former favorite, but only Stardew Valley has led to me purchasing the soundtrack on digital and two different vinyl releases (okay, one of those was a gift). It keeps the game from getting as monotonous as it MIGHT otherwise get sometimes. Its similar to the Tetris song. After enough playing, the music is ingrained in my soul. Lmao


Gorgeous pixel graphics. Amazing variety and loads of charm. The creator clearly has a deep passion for this game and it shows in nearly every way.


This game deserves so much more money and appreciation than it gets.


11/10 - stop ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ around and buy the game already. I dont care if you find farming boring.

PS - shout out to my brother. He never got to experience this masterpiece, but at least we had good times on Harvest Moon. He would have loved it. RIP 1987-2007"

This game is dangerous.

When I first started playing I was like, ""It's cool, farming is fun but I don't really see the hype around it.""

Then I kept playing.

It's gotten so bad that I have 10 tabs open just to look up stuff on the wiki for this game. I open the game and blink and two hours have passed, and while I feel sad that I just lost so much time, I look at the progress I made on my farm and think, ""Worth.""

This is one of the most fun games I've ever played.

It's designed in such a way that it allows both casual players and competitive / optimization-oriented players to have a blast with this game. There is so much to do in this game, and there's so much to offer. You can spend your days farming, fishing, mining, foraging, talking to the villagers, etc. The game is made in a way in which you don't have to hyper-optimize every little detail like min-maxing profit, time management, etc, because there's no time limit for things (unless you count seasons, but there's always another year) and there's no stakes. But if you want to, you definitely can.

Talking to the villagers is fun as well, they're well-designed, and you can even find patterns in their daily schedules. There's a lot of details in this game.

I haven't tried the multiplayer, but from what I've seen it can definitely be a lot more fun with friends. But playing solo is extremely fun as well.

My only gripe with the game is that it's a huge time sink. I waited until my semester was over to get into it because I heard about the time sink beforehand, and I was glad I waited, because all I can think about now is, ""What crops am I going to plant next season? Where I should place them? How much money am I making from these? Should I fish or mine? Did I feed my animals today? DID I TALK TO ROBIN TODAY?""

And of course, Robin is best girl, no discussion there."

This game is nothing short of straight BEAUTY. I have never played a farming sim before this, and honestly I thought I wouldn't like it because it was so different from the games I usually played at the time (FPS). As soon as I cracked it open, I felt the joy of 100 perfect headshots of a PvP match light up my cerebral cortex as my brain was melted by the gracious and time-taking beauty of Stardew Valley. The amazing 16-bit design of the character portraits, freshly tilled ground, and don't get me started on the fishing. Without any guides, I made 15,000 Gold before Winter, and even with watching guides, you never feel like you're cheating yourself, because there's just so much joy to it that it is impossible to ruin the game with watching videos about (spoiler) and (spoiler). I was amazed to learn that this was created by ONE GUY, Mr. Eric Barone. May whatever God he believe in bless his soul, as he has blessed mine with this amazing game.

One thing I never realized until I finished the game is that you shouldn't rush it. I got everything done 8 years in game, found all the secrets, got 100% completionist on the tracker, found all the secret cutscenes, collected every hats, accessories, rings and weapons that are available in the game and have completed all endgame content. But when the credit starts rolling, all I feel is emptiness and a void that I can no longer fill up. This is a wonderful game that's just so inviting and calming to play, whether it is by myself or with a friend and now it is all over.

If you have got the time to spare, take my advice and enjoy the slow ride. Don't rush it and try to get everything with a guide early on, because all there is at the end is the credits."

I remember buying this game for my brother a few years back. Didn't think much of it at the time, but I thought it would be a nice gift for him. I remember seeing him playing it from time to time, the message indicating that he'd started playing it popping up on the corner of my screen. There was always a certain small pride in seeing that, because to me it meant that he was enjoying my gift.
Last September he committed suicide.
After everything had more or less settled down from that, I sat down and booted up his computer. All that was on there was Chrome, Steam, Word, and a few games. One of them, of course, was Stardew Valley.
He had played this game to pieces, clocking over 170 hours and owning practically everything the game had to offer. He had used every square inch to its maximum potential, and was making ridiculous amounts of cash. It was only then did I see just how much he loved his present. No other game he played quite captured his affection as much as this one. None of his friends really knew about it, however; it seems like he preferred to keep it to himself. Like it was his own little bit of heaven he could turn to whenever he wanted.

And because of that, I can't help but smile whenever I play this game.

I cannot recommend it enough; every bit of hard work the developer put into this masterpiece shows in every single aspect. The music is catchy and memorable (i'll ofetn find myself humming certain tunes from it), the world feels lived-in and natural, and the gameplay is incredibly laid back and enjoyable. It's hard to stop once I get invested in the game; minutes can easily turn into several hours. And now, with the multiplayer beta, I play for even longer with my friends, each of us dedicated to our desired jobs. Most of all, however, we're all just happy to be together."

I grew up playing Harvest Moon with my mom and it is one of my fondest memories. She would always buy me the new one for Christmas, and we would play it all day, filling notebooks full of recipes and discussing which person we hoped to marry. Although Stardew Valley has unmistakable similarities to Harvest Moon, it is a masterpiece in it's own right, one that is very dear to my heart after all those years playing with my mum.

Stardew Valley is complex and simple, heartwarming and detailed. It's complicated enough that so many hours later I still haven't completed most of the achievements or befriended most of the townsfolk, but it's simple and easy enough that I play it almost every night on the couch after work.

Concerned Ape has programmed a masterpiece; his story is just as heartwarming as the story he created. I anticipate each new release and I can't wait to see how far he takes this wonderful game. I rarely give games a perfect score, but this certainly deserves a ten out of ten."

This game has been a great distraction since I lost my ability to walk. Sustained a work injury in January that leaves me permanently bedridden. It's so calming to build a farm and watch it thrive! I love the interactions with all the townfolk, and there's so many cool secrets in this game I can't even begin. Wish my wife could've played this game with me :)"

Thank you.
I really hope the developers are able to find this review somehow.

We all have difficult times in our lives.

I started playing Stardew Valley in April 2021, which was not an easy moment in my life. Apart from the COVID pandemic, i was struggling with high anxiety/depression, college was online and the pressure, both from the university and myself, never stopped. It was hard. I cried a lot. But somehow i got through this.
I never played this kind of game before, sort of ""Harvest Moon""-like i guess. But i wanted to try something that i could just... Relax. Enjoy. Take a deep breath and calm my mind. Relieve the tension. Chill.

Stardew Valley, for me, was kind of... a life saver.
I'm still playing it (100h and counting) and the game still do what it did in the beginning: it's an incredibly charming and relaxing game, it's fun and it has likable characters, so far it has been an experience that i am very happy i gave it a shot.
It's one of my favorite indie games ever now. Right beside Bastion, Hollow Knight and Shovel Knight, other favorites of mine.

Stardew Valley calmed me when i needed most. And i will not forget that.

There isn't much to be said that hasn't already been said for this amazing game if you enjoyed the classic harvest moon type games you will absolutely 100% enjoy this. The game play seems fresh and fun even after clocking in over 60 hours, You won't want to quit, “Just 1 more day” then you realize that turned into 5 days and it's 4am and you have to sleep sometime.

This game, takes the old harvest moon concepts and tosses in a bit of Rune factory and a sprinkle of animal crossing leaving you with a sensational experience. Each day brings something fresh, There is over 25 different Npc's to interact with each day and each one brings their own charm and dialogue options depending on if you take the time to build up your friendships.

Your farm can be whatever you make it, You design what it looks like, how it runs, what you plant and what animals you choose to raise. The fishing can be a bit difficult to begin with but very rewarding and relaxing once you get the hang of it. On days you want something a bit different you can hop into the mine and find some rare gems, ores and minerals, Some that you can donate to the game's huge museum or use to upgrade your tools!

I can't praise this game enough, if your on the fence about purchasing this game or you think you should wait for a sale, Don't wait! This game was made by a single developer who deserves every single penny for all the obvious hard work and dedication. So go and farm your butt off!!!!"

This is a game that I have been looking forward to for at least 2 and a half years. I have wanted to have a game on the PC that had the elements of harvest moon (for the little bit I played of it), Animal crossing (<3) and Rune factory. I was super excited when I was approached by Leth (publishing manager at Chucklefish) at the beginning of December to help him and ConcernedApe (developer of the game) with bug testing and QA. 400+ hours later (off steam and on steam), I still love the game.

Farming. The farming is fantastic. It is to me one of the main elements of the game, and it's just a joy. Being able to design your farm any way you want it... yes please. Planning out what to buy every season, where to plant them, on top of the thrill of when you can harvest and reap on the gold... it's so enjoyable and addictive.

Fishing. The fishing is outstanding. From playing WoW and Runescape.. or any game with fishing, the fishing in Stardew Valley is so much fun. At first, the fishing is challenging, but as you progress your skill, you become a pro in no time.

Mining and combat is incredible. Going deeper into the mines can be tough, but if you're prepared with your food and weapon in hand, you can fend off the creatures and get your sweet ore/minerals/gems that you want to bring back to your house and possibly hoard. (Hi, I'm Bexy, and i'm a hoarder.)

Social interactions are great. Being able to become friends with the people in the town, and eventually being able to get into relationships with people and having a family with them.. what's not to like about that? And what's great is that it gives great replayability because you can have different saves with different spouses! The backstory for each of the characters too is so in depth and well thought out, you will be silly if you don't shed a tear maybe once or twice.

The actual main story is well rewarding, and once you ""complete"" it, you can still continue on your adventures and farming life with no problems, hell you might even discover new things afterwards, I sure as hell did!

Yes, I was a tester for the game. Yes, I have played for ridiculous amounts of hours. It may feel like i'm being a bit overzealous with this. However you have to remember, I was a tester. I tested the crap out of every aspect with this game, even though there were massive game breaking bugs, errors, glitches, crashes. I still love this game. I reported many a bug, and ConcernedApe was quick to fix them.

And that's the thing, not only is the game amazing, the developer is too. ConcernedApe works around the clock to make sure that bugs are fixed in quick time in order for us to have an amazing experience with this game. And that's true. The experience that you have with this game IS amazing.

Minutes playing turn into hours. Hours turn into ""oh no it's time to sleep"".
You will forget about time. You will forget about sleep. You will forget that dinner was about 5 hours ago but you couldn't' remember because you were too busy trying to fight off 12 bats that were clobbering you inside the mines while trying to gather that 1 diamond waaaaay in the back.

So yes, I without a shadow of a doubt 150% recommend this game to anyone that wants to ""escape"" for days on end with what I am classifying as my #1 Game of 2016."

INTRODUCTION

Stardew Valley.

I've heard a lot of things about this game. A lot of extremely positive things.

And I was doubtful. Was Stardew Valley really that good? I was afraid that people were just giving it attention because they didn't actually know what a good game was. And as insulting as it may sound, in my defense, uhhm....

Before buying the game I hadn't really seen what it looked like, or knew what it was about. I just knew that it was published by the same company, Chucklefish, that had developed Starbound. I had loved Starbound.. So I was playing completely spoiler free. Haven't watched any videos, no tips & tricks, just the information of a billion recommended reviews stuffed into my head.

So I bought Stardew Valley, and had pretty high expectations. If a game received THAT much popularity, it should be seriously good, right?



Plop. Into the world of Stardew Valley.

You completely start from the bottom, trailing after a tragedy and responsibility that's struck. A farm, barely any money, and the mystery of a town left in your hands. Whew. That's really a lot when you think about it.


Boy, did I NOT know what I was getting myself into.


At first, I was mesmorized. Or maybe lost is a better word. The beginning's all new and immersive, and the middle... kind of leaves you stuck. But, this is because I was impatient with the game. I went in wanting to finish it asap. However, I realized this game is NOT simply for you to buy and finish. It's something else... entirely.

The thing with Stardew Valley, It's all about exploration and management. Discovering and figuring out secrets and a beautiful story was amazing. Creative mechanics and powerful creativity had combined to produce a fabulous well-formed game that leaves a sweet taste in your mouth, and I'm going to tell you right now... it's totally addicting.

I bought the game a few days ago, and literally have played it all day since. I've NEVER done that with a game before. I found myself as a kid in a candy shop, gaping at all the different flavors, and being able to savor them all. And now, in Year 3 of the game.. I still have a lot more to discover.



Compared to others, I've only played around 130 hours of the game thus far. Buy Stardew Valley. You really won't regret it. This game is beautiful. The music is whimsically lifting, and the soundtrack is wonderful. It's a work of art. You will find yourself falling in love with the characters, and the daily routine of being a farmer who restores the life around people, and who changes everyone for the better. It's so relaxing, so addicting, and so much fun. I have played games for years, played games with far more hours than I have with Stardew Valley- and yet, I always turn to Stardew Valley first. Why? It's amazing. It offers something to everyone.

The game rewards for the hard-working. Stardew Valley is a game where you really have to manage things, yet, it allows you to explore the whole art of it. Work hard as you play the game, and there are sweet rewards. And I'm talking about rewards sweeter than all the candy in that candy shop.

Here's the thing: you can take two routes with Stardew Valley. You can either take the money route and become rich and miss half the game, or you can immerse yourself in exploring the town and what the game has to offer, but with also missing the point that Stardew is a management farming game.

Or, you can successfully find the balance between both. But how?

Stardew Valley allows you to store multiple accounts, which is fantastic. I recommend exploring with your first account, and learning the ropes. You seriously won't know anything yet, and will be like ""OMFG"" when you figure out there's a way that makes things one hundred times easier. After that, create a second account, and start figuring out farm management and what the game has to offer. This is a game in which you learn from your mistakes.

And now... I'm left in a spot where I can successfully thrive, and only continue to grow.



- Enchanting music that sings as you play

- A simple yet fun art design that you can't help but fall in love with

- Characters whom capture your heart

- A shambled town that begins to thrive

- Hidden secrets that you can't help but want to keep discovering

- Amazing challenges that leave you wanting more

- Brilliant originality, which is incredibly difficult to find

- A storyline that changes your perspective beautifully

- Lots of fun, and I mean .

- Mods created by the community to make your game more fun and immersive- however, I play without mods.

- IT FINALLY HAS MULTIPLAYER!



- As I said, the game rewards you for hard work. But only for hard work. It can be a grueling process, but it is extremely profitable. Those who don't like putting effort into a game won't enjoy Stardew Valley as much as other games.

- Time. Stardew Valley takes a lot of time to play through. It's a game you thoroughly have to enjoy and adventure out on.

- Repetitive. The game can be grueling. To reach certain goals you have to go through processes that you will SERIOUSLY hate. But, in the end, it's definitely worth the labor.




- I wish there would be more characters. Once you go through the storyline with everyone, there's not much lore left.

- More secrets and new areas, of course!



Stardew Valley offers a lot of things, and has changed the lives of many people. Perhaps in peace, wonder, open-mindedness, the game gives a lot. But I have one thing that's been bothering me for a long time... How in the damn world did one single person spit out a freaking awesome game?

Even though it's a farming game, which is commonly found everywhere, it's original with its own spins. It's extremely difficult to find a game that has such a captivating message that's been developed so well. Stardew Valley is a lot of fun and awe, and it really draws a blank in your mind.

Buy Stardew Valley. At first, it might seem mediocre... but keep playing. Trust me, the candies are still sweet. And they really only get sweeter."

If you look at the playtime above this review, you might be thinking to yourself... ""How on earth does one person invest 400 hours of their life into a game about farming?"" Well, it's a lot easier than you think.

Stardew Valley opens with our disillusioned protagonist slaving away at a corporate job, only to be reminded of a promise that they had made with their grandfather so many years ago. A promise of something to brighten the shadows when life becomes too dreary for them. Our stalwart protagonist waves goodbye to the grey walls of their office to board a train to Stardew Valley, an unknown paradise far away from the city. And it is here, where their life truly begins.

I can only wish that we all find our Stardew Valley someday. Yee-haw."

I convinced my brother to help me buy our mom a PS4 last Christmas so she could play Stardew Valley. She was playing the same Animal Crossing game on Wii for years, so getting her to try something new was risky.

After my brother showed her the TV apps, mom humored me and let me teach her how to play. She made a farm, and sort of caught on to using tools.

It’s August now. She’s logged over 500 hours into that farm. Her cellar is packed with kegs, the seashore is red with crab pots. She wields a flashy Return Scepter that I’ve never even gotten.

Spoiler free review, with a short and a longer version:

Buy this game if:

+ You're interested in farming, even though you're allowed to make that it isn't 100% of the core gameplay;
+ You were looking for a long, yet various and easy to be resumed game;
+ You're fond of pixelated indie games;
+ You can bear resource hunting and you have some patience, as there are some RPG and crafting gameplay;
+ You love games that are supported by modders and regularly updayed by the developer himself (Update 1.5 - see longer review part down below)

Don't buy the game if those above points aren't significant for you;






Longer version:
Let's see now the most important points, including the DLC, described in the 6th bullet point:

1-
Your grandpa, who lived the last part of his life is Stardew Valley has passed away and you as his nephew/niece have inherited a plot of land in Stardew Valley itself. Bored and saddened by the repetitive and dull life that you're spending working in a big firm (feel free to imagine it as Amazon/Nestlè)... you decide to accept the inheritance and embark in this new life and adventure.

2-
Even though clearing debris, pruning weeds, killing evil monsters and cutting trees is fun and necessary up to a certain point, you're not ""forced"" to keep farming 24/7, as the game is full of side activities who can be remunerative and of course fun, such as:
- tending to animals;
- mining;
- foraging;
- fishing:
- more...

3-
this means that besides customizing your own home, buildings and clothes there is a skill system, which can shape and improve the way on how you've decided to play the game;

4-
The NPCs are actually interesting and they're worth your time, socializing with them, helping them and confronting them on events, quests is always a good distraction and worth your time, as they'll be quite rewarding in terms of money, items and story progression in general, even though you're not forced to follow any particular path. Your actions have consequences that will also change the landscape and the city.

5-
I personally recommend Stardew Valley Expanded as a mod to be installed, feel free to check it on Nexusmods

6-
my biggest gripe with SV this free massive update from December 2020 was that there wasn't enough end-gameplay elements or goals to be reached. This update addressed completely these issues by adding a new whole area, distant from Stardew Valley, by adding new minerals, animals, crops, quests, weekly quests, npcs and much more, including many quality of life changes, which make the gameplay much smoother and fluid.

I spent three years building up hype, and I was still blown away.

If you enjoyed Harvest Moon, Rune Factory or Animal Crossing - then get this. It captures all the same things that made those games great, and it's the perfect game to play either casually or seriously. There are so many different ways to earn money and they're all developed and fun, the hardest part is choosing which one to spend your time doing.

The progression curve in the game is fantastic too. Every day you'll feel like you're making progress but there's still always something to work towards and you won't 'beat it' after a couple of hours earning as much money as possible, as there's always something to spend your money on. Even after 20 hours of playing, I feel like I'm nowhere near the endgame, and I could easily see myself playing through again and doing things differently. I'm even doing a playthrough on YouTube and the progress feels dramatically different even in its early stages.

I'm easily disappointed by games, so you can imagine my surprise when I was so impressed by a game made by one person. Congratulations, ConcernedApe, you've made one of the best games I've ever played."

Overview

Stardew Valley is a game that borrows heavily from similar titles in the Harvest Moon series. You start out in a rural town with nothing but a dilapidated house and crop fields that are more akin to the wilderness than a place to grow vegetables. The game is simple in its understanding: build a farm, make profits, live your life. What the game allows you to do makes it so much more layered. You're left with the freedom to explore the town, its residence, mold your farm into whatever you want it to be and on your own time. Sure, there are events to attend, festivals to see, men/women to romance and marry, kids to have, buildings to construct, fish to catch and weird little slimes to slay (Dragon Warrior, anyone?), but how and when you do those things is up to you.

In essence, the game offers you very similar things to do as a Harvest Moon game does: Build and upgrade your farm, plant crops, upgrade tools, mine in the never-ending dungeon for precious ore, go fishing, romance and get married...etc. While some of your old favorites are back, new aspects have been introduced as well, but I won't spoil those in this review. Let's just say there's a nice story that evolves over time.

The freedom to do as you please is what makes this game, and Harvest Moon in general, so enjoyable. It's a chance to mellow out, play at your own pace and still enjoy everything the game has to offer. What Stardew Valley does, it does right. It's charming, cute and feels rewarding, even when all you're doing is cuttings weeds. It doesn't pull any punches or try to be something its not; the developer had a goal in mind and Stardew Valley is a reflection of just that. You can feel the effort, the time and the devotion that went into this game over the years. Stardew Valley is a gem and worth looking at. If you loved Harvest Moon, you'll love Stardew Valley.

To date, Stardew Valley is a single player game, though the developer as mentioned some form of co-op or multiplayer availability in the future.











Overall, Stardew Valley is a pleasure. I haven't put a ton of time into it (yet), but I easily see that happening. It's fun, lighthearted and addictive. As I said earlier in this review, if you've ever played Harvest Moon, you'll enjoy Stardew Valley. It's worth checking out and I highly recommend it. This will easily become one of my most played games on my list. You won't be disappointed, so check it out!"

I was never interested in farming games. I’ve never played a Harvest Moon game or an Animal Crossing game, and never had any interest in them. The closest thing to a farming game I’ve ever played was Minecraft. I definitely would have never tried Stardew Valley if I wasn’t an achievement hunter and it didn’t have achievements.

But now I see what all the hype was about.

Stardew Valley is a game that is very easy to lose oneself into. There are many elements of the game that feel intimately relatable to real life, especially the game’s premise: you’re stuck at a soul-crushing corporate office job when your grandfather dies, leaving you an envelope telling you to open it only when you’ve reached your absolute limit and need something new. After a particularly bad day at work, you finally decide to open the envelope and find a deed to your grandfather’s farm on a far-off island, so you take the plunge and decide to move there. It is a very strong analogy to the game itself, where you, the player, are seeking escapism from your daily life and decide to take the plunge into this game, not knowing what else to expect.

In Stardew Valley, you will find your new home upon a sizable but absolutely trashed plot of land. As the days go by, you can clean up the land and discover hundreds of ways to make a profit with what you’ve been given, from buying seeds and planting crops, to raising animals, to fishing (by means of a surprisingly pleasant and addictive quicktime event), to foraging for wild food, and even to exploring a few combat-centric Zelda-style dungeons. But you’re not making money for its own sake – there are dozens of mysterious secrets scattered about the land, each with significant and game-changing rewards at the end, and you need to raise the money and resources to investigate them all. The game experience is going to be totally different for everybody depending on what game elements you are inspired to pursue first. Although you’ll assuredly be looking at a wiki in due time, it is deeply satisfying to go in blind and piece things together yourself for as long as you can.

Years consist of four months, each month being 28-day season. Some gameplay mechanics change with the seasons, particularly that certain crops only grow in certain seasons, and (almost) no crops grow in winter, so you’ll have to carefully consider what seeds to plant and when. Each day lasts about five minutes, and you’ve got to make sure you’re back in your house by 2AM, or else you’ll pass out and lose some money. The biggest way the game hooks you is the fact that your progress is only saved at the of a day – so if you’re eager to wake up in the morning and harvest your crops, it won’t mean anything unless you play the whole day through. A vicious cycle! I clocked 120 hours of this game in the first 2 weeks of playing. That’s how bad it is.

Another one of the game’s strengths is the cozy little community you live beside, with a population of about 25 people. The game does a wonderful job of making each character feel like their own entity, with their own daily routines and backstories and motivations. You’ll really get to know and love them. You can give gifts to characters to increase friendship level with them, unlocking character development cutscenes and important rewards. You can even date some of them (you can have 6 boyfriends and 6 girlfriends at once if you want, no joke; relationships are gender-indiscriminate) and then marry the character of your choice. The social aspect is sometimes a bit too real – you’ll feel the pain of rejection all too often – but that makes the successful relationships all the more heartwarming.

As for complaints: surprisingly, the game has some strange and baffling bugs, most of which are visual (like ice-skating horses), but some which affect gameplay, and a few known save-corruption bugs. I also felt consistently uncomfortable with the controls. If you're using the mouse, your cursor needs to always be in proximity of your character, or else you'll only aim at the tile in front of you, making it very easy to abruptly turn the wrong direction while working. And if you accidentally click the wrong tile, your character will turn to face it, changing the default direction you aim, compounding the problem. It can be infuriating, especially if it causes you to accidentally destroy crops. Also, I don't like how you can only talk to NPCs if you have a tool selected, and how you'll use a consumable item at the same time as opening a door if you have one selected. The controls could definitely use some additional polish.

Then there are the inventory controls. If you click on an inventory item, you pick it up and you can drop it in a different inventory slot. If you click on an inventory item with a storage box open, you will immediately transfer the item into (or out of) the box. Thus, it is impossible to organize the inventory with a storage box open. If you click on an inventory item while in a shop, . I can't tell you the amount of times I purchased 200 seeds, then immediately sold them again just because I tried to pick them up and put them in a different slot.

Also, I can’t help but feel the game should have even more content than it already does – perhaps more dungeons, a bigger map, and the ability to run more than one farm. But (as of this writing) the game is still in active development, including a co-op multiplayer patch in the works, and a lively modding community.

I give this game an 8/10. A wonderful example of what all those crappy Farmville mobile games would be like if they were actually balanced around gameplay and not milking the player with microtansactions and daily login bonuses. Despite some stupidly distracting bugs and annoying controls, it’s some simply wonderful escapism, and made me finally see the appeal in a farming game. It does get stale in time, but not before offering a huge amount of joy. For achievement hunting, it’ll easily take about 200 hours, especially blind… but if you’re like me, you’ll have it over with in a month or two. A huge thumbs-up."

Originally, when I was younger and inconsiderate, I pirated this game and sunk in at least 100 hours. Once I had my own money, I bought this game on Steam when the multiplayer update came out. I played a lot with my girlfriend at the time, and when we broke up, I stopped playing for a while and deleted the save. A few months later I was in a low place, so I bought this game on Switch and completed the story and got married, and had kids (so I sunk in a fair amount of hours ~200) It was the only thing motivating me to look after myself as I wanted to keep playing. As I recovered from that dark part of my life, I played less and less until a friend mentioned they wanted to play with me. So now I've been chilling on a farm with my friend through lockdown. This game as a whole has helped me through a lot, and has given me a bunch of great memories. I recommend Stardew Valley to anyone that likes Harvest Moon, farming sims in general, or just having a great time. The music is stellar and the art style is nice and fits with the game. Generally a great experience!!"

Stardew Valley is literally the first game that I bought in seconds, with the full price, without thinking. I was a Harvest Moon lover, I really, really wanted to have a PC game like HM, and Oh my.
ConcernedApe, you sir, are one of the most amazing developers, both in terms of actual developing, and keeping up with the date as well. There are a lot of games out there that were abondened by their devs, but our supreme leader listens. Makes it happen. And I am oh so greatful.
The story, the characters, the customization, mods that you can get, amount of things you can do in this games is just amazing, also, it is, IT REALLY IS, Beautiful~ You can see in the wiki, how the NPC development went, you can feel the time this game was given by this person, and he deserves every single penny and every single praise for it.
Thank you for making my childhood dreams come true.

All joking aside, this is a fantastic game. Hundreds of hours of content in this little pixel art game about farming and bringing a dying town back to life.

I grew up playing Harvest Moon on the SNES. My parents probably rented the game a dozen+ times before putting up the money to just buy the damn game. My brother and I dumped hours, and hours, and hours into that game. Beating it multiple times to see some of the different endings.


A few years ago, for the first time, a game was released that bested the original Harvest Moon. That game is obviously Fortnite. JK


Stardew Valley is such a good spiritual successor, that it beats the original hand over fist. It's entirely it's own game, while nodding its head to what I assume is its source inspiration. It exceeded my expectations by a lot, and it continues to be improved on again and again.


This game has a lot of replayability (just ask my wife who has nearly 1000 hours logged by now). Between different relationships, different focuses, different game altering choices, and different property layouts and designs. There's enough content to keep you entertained and coming back for a very long time.


It might seem minor, but the games soundtrack is probably one of the best, if not THE best out there. Chrono Cross was my former favorite, but only Stardew Valley has led to me purchasing the soundtrack on digital and two different vinyl releases (okay, one of those was a gift). It keeps the game from getting as monotonous as it MIGHT otherwise get sometimes. Its similar to the Tetris song. After enough playing, the music is ingrained in my soul. Lmao


Gorgeous pixel graphics. Amazing variety and loads of charm. The creator clearly has a deep passion for this game and it shows in nearly every way.


This game deserves so much more money and appreciation than it gets.


11/10 - stop ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ around and buy the game already. I dont care if you find farming boring.

PS - shout out to my brother. He never got to experience this masterpiece, but at least we had good times on Harvest Moon. He would have loved it. RIP 1987-2007"

This game is dangerous.

When I first started playing I was like, ""It's cool, farming is fun but I don't really see the hype around it.""

Then I kept playing.

It's gotten so bad that I have 10 tabs open just to look up stuff on the wiki for this game. I open the game and blink and two hours have passed, and while I feel sad that I just lost so much time, I look at the progress I made on my farm and think, ""Worth.""

This is one of the most fun games I've ever played.

It's designed in such a way that it allows both casual players and competitive / optimization-oriented players to have a blast with this game. There is so much to do in this game, and there's so much to offer. You can spend your days farming, fishing, mining, foraging, talking to the villagers, etc. The game is made in a way in which you don't have to hyper-optimize every little detail like min-maxing profit, time management, etc, because there's no time limit for things (unless you count seasons, but there's always another year) and there's no stakes. But if you want to, you definitely can.

Talking to the villagers is fun as well, they're well-designed, and you can even find patterns in their daily schedules. There's a lot of details in this game.

I haven't tried the multiplayer, but from what I've seen it can definitely be a lot more fun with friends. But playing solo is extremely fun as well.

My only gripe with the game is that it's a huge time sink. I waited until my semester was over to get into it because I heard about the time sink beforehand, and I was glad I waited, because all I can think about now is, ""What crops am I going to plant next season? Where I should place them? How much money am I making from these? Should I fish or mine? Did I feed my animals today? DID I TALK TO ROBIN TODAY?""

And of course, Robin is best girl, no discussion there."

There are plenty of games out there that might give you a higher high. Getting the highest score in a lobby of some FPS for example.

There are plenty of games that will give you a lower low. Seeing your companion die in some RPG for example.

This game is nothing short of straight BEAUTY. I have never played a farming sim before this, and honestly I thought I wouldn't like it because it was so different from the games I usually played at the time (FPS). As soon as I cracked it open, I felt the joy of 100 perfect headshots of a PvP match light up my cerebral cortex as my brain was melted by the gracious and time-taking beauty of Stardew Valley. The amazing 16-bit design of the character portraits, freshly tilled ground, and don't get me started on the fishing. Without any guides, I made 15,000 Gold before Winter, and even with watching guides, you never feel like you're cheating yourself, because there's just so much joy to it that it is impossible to ruin the game with watching videos about (spoiler) and (spoiler). I was amazed to learn that this was created by ONE GUY, Mr. Eric Barone. May whatever God he believe in bless his soul, as he has blessed mine with this amazing game.

As you can see from my hours played I adore this game.

Whenever I search for a new game I go to the reviews and I make sure that the majority of the reviewers have played for more than 100 hours. Amount of hours played gives a game credibility in my opinion.

I have played and played and played Stardew Valley in many ways.

I have tried all of the maps, explored every inch, and grew to know every character.

Tonight my hubby and I are delving into the multiplayer beta and I still feel thrilled as if it was my first time playing.

The music is relaxing, the atmosphere is enjoyable, really everything about this game is made for one such as me.
I have a four year old and at night after bedtime I hop on my computer to calm down after the day. I nearly always go for Stardew Valley to really destress. (Though recently I have been attached to My Time at Portia lol), but still I come back to Stardew.

Every new time I play I try to knock out another steam challenge or two.

I try to woo new characters.

I try to keep it fresh.

And, thus far I still love this game as much as I did the first time I opened it."

By admission of the dev himself, this game is Harvest Moon at its core. A formula that is purely addictive and satisfying as hell.

But there is something Stardew Valley has over Harvest Moon, and that's a heart. The intro to the game is incredibly human and relatable. I sympathized with my character right off the bat. I think we all know how it feels to want to escape the mundane grind, and in a funny kind of way, this game does that.

A moment I felt that the game truly had a soul was when I was walking to the mines on a rainy day, when suddenly I was greeted by a cutscene of coming upon Abigail, my romance interest, playing a flute next to the lake. It's a very quiet scene, with nothing but the sound of rain and her flute playing. After some dialog, my character (who is a silent protagonist by the way) pulls out a mini harp and joins Abby in a duet, something that really surprised me as there was no indication that my character had any musical talent prior to this scene. It was a bonding experience, and it felt incredibly real, memorable, and touching. I'll always remember it.

And when you realize that there are TEN love interests in this game with different scenes like this for each of them, man, that's an intimidating amount of content.

Maybe I shouldn't be saying that Harvest Moon doesn't have any heart at all, but when it comes down to it, this is the game that I'm going to remember more fondly in the end. I made memories with Harvest Moon as a child. Now I'm making memories with Stardew Valley as an adult. You should too. The game is worth full price and then some."

9/10 Stardew Valley is a fantastic casual game for anyone that can enjoy a more relaxed pace of things. This game's simple premise of rebuilding the family farm in a particularly quaint village with an array of fun character's to interact with never feels old. Much of the game is spent trying to make your farm plot perfect to your liking while attempting to maintain relationships with the townfolk. Stardew plays at any pace you want to play at and that is especially rewarding, you will find yourself prioritizing and making chore lists and juggling all of your other duties, but you will do so in a natural rhythym of your own pace and comfort. I am highly awaiting the arrival of the multiplayer update as currently I'm playing with my significant other using a mod for multiplayer - while the mod works, the legitimate update will be much more welcomed! I can't recommend this game enough and once multiplayer is released, I dare say this will be a must-own game for gaming couples!

Edit: Multiplayer has been released and is as amazing as we'd all hoped. This game is an absolute must for all gaming couples. While the multiplayer adds additional player cabins to your property that act as your guest(s) home, they can still sleep in the host's bed and use the main house as if it were their own."
