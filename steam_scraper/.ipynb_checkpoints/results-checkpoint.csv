Fun and relaxing game. Always something to do and the updates keep it interesting. I am 72, have tried to play other games, but they cannot compete with Stardew, so I only play Stardew. Thank you, Concerned Ape."

This game got me through a really dark place in my life. I lost my job, spouse, and home in less than a year. I would chop wood and fish when I couldn't find the energy to do anything else and fall asleep on the couch listening to the background music. I've put thousands of hours into Stardew Valley. The little successes I had were the catalyst I needed to think maybe I could have little successes again in life, too. Highly recommend. Thank you for making this game."

Ok so far from my game this is what I got:
> farming for first week
> mayor tells me to socialize with the townfolk
> decide to talk to random people
> lots of talking
> finally think i met everyone
> try to interact with trashcan
> find a salad in trash, untouched
> girl sees me digging in trash
> girl gets grossed out from me digging in the trash
> get mad, decide to follow her
> catch her walking towards lake
> turns out shes pretty
> want to know how to marry her
> find out that i can gift people
> dont know what to gift
> remembered i had salad from the trash that she saw me grab
> give salad to her
> she loves it
> advance a year or two later
> me and girl are married

Is this how true love works?

One thing I never realized until I finished the game is that you shouldn't rush it. I got everything done 8 years in game, found all the secrets, got 100% completionist on the tracker, found all the secret cutscenes, collected every hats, accessories, rings and weapons that are available in the game and have completed all endgame content. But when the credit starts rolling, all I feel is emptiness and a void that I can no longer fill up. This is a wonderful game that's just so inviting and calming to play, whether it is by myself or with a friend and now it is all over.

If you have got the time to spare, take my advice and enjoy the slow ride. Don't rush it and try to get everything with a guide early on, because all there is at the end is the credits."

I remember buying this game for my brother a few years back. Didn't think much of it at the time, but I thought it would be a nice gift for him. I remember seeing him playing it from time to time, the message indicating that he'd started playing it popping up on the corner of my screen. There was always a certain small pride in seeing that, because to me it meant that he was enjoying my gift.
Last September he committed suicide.
After everything had more or less settled down from that, I sat down and booted up his computer. All that was on there was Chrome, Steam, Word, and a few games. One of them, of course, was Stardew Valley.
He had played this game to pieces, clocking over 170 hours and owning practically everything the game had to offer. He had used every square inch to its maximum potential, and was making ridiculous amounts of cash. It was only then did I see just how much he loved his present. No other game he played quite captured his affection as much as this one. None of his friends really knew about it, however; it seems like he preferred to keep it to himself. Like it was his own little bit of heaven he could turn to whenever he wanted.

And because of that, I can't help but smile whenever I play this game.

I cannot recommend it enough; every bit of hard work the developer put into this masterpiece shows in every single aspect. The music is catchy and memorable (i'll ofetn find myself humming certain tunes from it), the world feels lived-in and natural, and the gameplay is incredibly laid back and enjoyable. It's hard to stop once I get invested in the game; minutes can easily turn into several hours. And now, with the multiplayer beta, I play for even longer with my friends, each of us dedicated to our desired jobs. Most of all, however, we're all just happy to be together."

I grew up playing Harvest Moon with my mom and it is one of my fondest memories. She would always buy me the new one for Christmas, and we would play it all day, filling notebooks full of recipes and discussing which person we hoped to marry. Although Stardew Valley has unmistakable similarities to Harvest Moon, it is a masterpiece in it's own right, one that is very dear to my heart after all those years playing with my mum.

Stardew Valley is complex and simple, heartwarming and detailed. It's complicated enough that so many hours later I still haven't completed most of the achievements or befriended most of the townsfolk, but it's simple and easy enough that I play it almost every night on the couch after work.

Concerned Ape has programmed a masterpiece; his story is just as heartwarming as the story he created. I anticipate each new release and I can't wait to see how far he takes this wonderful game. I rarely give games a perfect score, but this certainly deserves a ten out of ten."

Thank you.
I really hope the developers are able to find this review somehow.

We all have difficult times in our lives.

I started playing Stardew Valley in April 2021, which was not an easy moment in my life. Apart from the COVID pandemic, i was struggling with high anxiety/depression, college was online and the pressure, both from the university and myself, never stopped. It was hard. I cried a lot. But somehow i got through this.
I never played this kind of game before, sort of ""Harvest Moon""-like i guess. But i wanted to try something that i could just... Relax. Enjoy. Take a deep breath and calm my mind. Relieve the tension. Chill.

Stardew Valley, for me, was kind of... a life saver.
I'm still playing it (100h and counting) and the game still do what it did in the beginning: it's an incredibly charming and relaxing game, it's fun and it has likable characters, so far it has been an experience that i am very happy i gave it a shot.
It's one of my favorite indie games ever now. Right beside Bastion, Hollow Knight and Shovel Knight, other favorites of mine.

Stardew Valley calmed me when i needed most. And i will not forget that.

There isn't much to be said that hasn't already been said for this amazing game if you enjoyed the classic harvest moon type games you will absolutely 100% enjoy this. The game play seems fresh and fun even after clocking in over 60 hours, You won't want to quit, “Just 1 more day” then you realize that turned into 5 days and it's 4am and you have to sleep sometime.

This game, takes the old harvest moon concepts and tosses in a bit of Rune factory and a sprinkle of animal crossing leaving you with a sensational experience. Each day brings something fresh, There is over 25 different Npc's to interact with each day and each one brings their own charm and dialogue options depending on if you take the time to build up your friendships.

Your farm can be whatever you make it, You design what it looks like, how it runs, what you plant and what animals you choose to raise. The fishing can be a bit difficult to begin with but very rewarding and relaxing once you get the hang of it. On days you want something a bit different you can hop into the mine and find some rare gems, ores and minerals, Some that you can donate to the game's huge museum or use to upgrade your tools!

I can't praise this game enough, if your on the fence about purchasing this game or you think you should wait for a sale, Don't wait! This game was made by a single developer who deserves every single penny for all the obvious hard work and dedication. So go and farm your butt off!!!!"

If you're looking for a wholesome game that destroys your IRL health bar, look no further. The regularly satisfying hits of dopamine will cause addiction. You'll lose sleep due to the ""Just one more day"" factor. You'll strain your eyes. Your most visited website will change. The existential crisis that will awaken in you for enjoying a pixelated, 2-D world more than your reality will send you down a path of reflection and, in most cases, enlightenment. Probably."
