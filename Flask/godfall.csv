Since the game will not receive any updates anymore, here are some things you can expect:

1 - Combat and gameplay is awesome. It can get a bit boring on the Exalted Tower because the easiest way to get efficient on combat is to spam Weapon Techniques, particulary with Long Swords, which gives you invulnerability frames. Good or bad, use whatever works for you to reach the end.

2 - Limited crafting: quest rewards aren't an efficient way to get items version of whatever you need and upgrading rarity from items gives completely random affixes, so the best way to get better items is just to drop them. Important to note that the best way to farm Amulets and Charms with two primary affixes are to spam Dreamstone of the Expansion bosses (Moirax and Kragani). Getting your resistances capped and good amount of damage affixes can be tricky, but it's easier than you think: usually two items with that base resistance (or one upgraded one) is enough, coupled with some ""all resistances"" traits.

3 - Make use of the Codex to understand the gameplay as you play it. Don't try to read it all at once. Most of the effects don't display numbers or specific informations, but it will help you out.

4 - Gorgeous Graphics, poor clarity. You will get what I mean in the later floors of the Tower.

5 - Some Cursed Items are mandatory for builds and can be found in LightBringer and in the Exalted Tower. They have painful quests to be completed to revert their negative secundary affixes to positives values.

6 - Think less and Slay more: spam dreamstones when short on game time. Try the Ascended or Exalted Tower when you have 90min or more in a play session. Dreamstone are a great way (althought boringly easy) to farm the special Amulet and Necklace, getting orbs for gear upgrades or Coins to pay the Tower fee. Dreamstones should be done solo.

7 - Some people can experience a bug where the Tower have no cost: abuse it. The cost for the Tower is completely pointless. Exalted Tower is worth paying for even if you can clear at least 3 ou 4 floors. Always choose Primal/Cursed/other in this order. I've played with a friend where I hosted all the story quests of the campaign. While he also got the completion for it, his Tower was free, which helped a lot in grinding gear. Maybe doing this will replicate the bug.

8 - This is NOT a game to be played just for the campaign. This is a game supposed to be played extensively, but lacks the depth to be your main and only game. Keep grinding in Godfall betwen games to amount resources and try builds, which is where the game shines.

9 - I've bought it with a disccount, but for the time I played, I believe it's worth it's full price if you are into this grinding fiesta. Great brainless activity. Try to play at least the Spirit Realm with a friend, because that mode sucks ass and you have to get it done for some of the Armours.

10 - When doing Lightbringer in a group, only the person that interacts with the Light Caches counts as opening it, so balance out which one is doing this requirement. Playing in a group helps, but the game will Only start a multiplayer session if the party is full (3 people) or after 3 minutes. Yes, I've waited 3 minutes EACH TIME FOR EVERY ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ MISSION/MODE when I played with my friend.

11 - You can find content creators with build ideas and guides, but there isn't much to learn besides what is written here, but the Journey is fun. Just don't start at max level (yes, that is a feature) and dont upgrade your items before you hit 50.

12 - Don't spam the ""Mass Salvage"" option: there are a lot of low rarity items that, once enchanted to Legendary are the Best in Slot for that Armour Playstyle (specialy the Lion's Charm, the Dragoncoil Long Sword, some Rings and Lifestones and Banners in general).

13 - The best way to farm Resources for upgrading items is throught Volatile Dreamstone. Make sure to always choose the higher stability until you reach 75+, then you can decide from there. Always make the optional objetives. Slowly you will get the gist of it. But most importantly: rebember to spend the Shaping resource betwen every level, only getting the specific resources you need (ie. Orbs and Coins of Valor, mostly) or saving for that buy after the next level.

14 - There are free codes online that awards different skins for some Armours. Goolgle it. It is easy to find.

15 - You can Kill the Dreamstone Boss with a finished build, switch to a loadout where you have tons of cursed items for quests and then execute the boss for those Cursed Quests."

Truth be told, Godfall isn't so bad of a game. But it's not a landmark must play either. There is nothing new to see here. Everything within, you've likely done before -- perhaps more times than you can count. But at the very least it offers a somewhat competent experience; but that is only because you have been spared the Early Access state of the game which first emerged on the Epic Store.

Godfall is best described as that insufferable person you knew in High School that claimed to have the all the very best ideas. According to them, their dream title would be set within an awesome and amazing world; where one may experience epic clashes not just against monsters, but against the very gods themselves!! Surely once you sat down with that person and finally heard what they had to say, you were met with not only wholly unoriginal ideas -- but those that were incredibly trite and insanely shallow as well. This is the nature of Godfall; and by extension, Counterplay Games. For without a shadow a doubt, the inexperienced developers over at Counterplay found this ambitious title to be well beyond their means.

But is it truly such a bad game? In the end there are numerous games of far poorer quality. Yet to measure oneself upon the failures of others, is to merely crown oneself as King of a hill of corpses. It is a painfully mediocre game; crap of the highest quality; a truly polished turd if there ever was one. Despite that, it is still somewhat playable. There is enjoyment to be had here, in the same vein that there is enjoyment to be had in eating a tub of icecream while bingeing RomComs. You'll be given a sense of mild satiation, but there are far better things you can do with your time.

Godfall is a strange creature; it proclaims great things, but underdelivers in just about every front. Furthermore, it has tried to appoint itself as King of a genre by coining a new term (Looter-Slasher), and exploiting the Google Search results of that term. But there is nothing new to be found here. Godfall follows beat-for-beat gameplay and mechanics introduced in titles such as Hellgate: London (2007), Dungeon Defenders (2010), and more recently even Warframe (2013). You will encounter much of what you've experienced before; narrow hallways connecting a collecting of small areas populated by a handful of monsters. Breakable objects throughout contain currency, health, and the occasional hidden collectable just out of reach.


The history of Godfall has been a turbulent at best. It was the very definition of rushed to launch, where any early adopter at that time was rendered an involuntary Beta Tester. Upon the game's release there was only a handful of things to do and the only legitimate Endgame was the Ascended Tower of Trials; which at the time was an endless assortment of floors that promised randomized encounters. However, anyone who made it past floor 30 would be quick to tell you that all floor patterns repeated indefinitely until you either died or simply got bored of the effort.

The game boasted a few different modes, one of them being Explore the Realm; which allowed you to tackle one of the three regions available at the time (Earth, Water, or Air) -- unhindered by story prompts and cut scenes. It was, at the time, one of the more promising of the modes as it encouraged you to make use of many underutilized features like Spirit Vision. However, the Water and Air Regions of this mode were fraught with game breaking glitches that left them entirely unplayable. Rendering the Earth Region the only example of a feature complete Explore Mode at the time.

However, instead of providing prompt fixes to these issues; Explore the Realm Mode was stripped from the game entirely and replaced with a stripped down version. After an additional year of development, it was finally re-released when they introduced the fourth and final realm; Fire. Another example of troubled development was the game's Augmentation System. This allowed players to slot upgrades into Valorplates so that they may better tune their builds. One such Augment, known as Void Shell, was improperly coded. This was a High Tier Legendary Augment that a lot of players wished to use due to its regenerative and defensive properties. However, the augment remained useless until the Lightbringer Update; which came out more than a year and a half after release. But these are just some of the problems that help to paint a picture of how this game has performed.


As noted before, the Ascended Tower of Trials was the only viable Endgame for a great deal of time. This was no longer the case of the Lightbringers Update, and the new six-man mode introduced alongside the game's release of Steam. Yet one of the most painful and game breaking bugs with the Ascended Tower of Trials persists to this very day, and one that traps players and renders them incapable of completing the mode at intended. The Tower consists of a variety of chambers. Accessing each chamber prompts the player with a challenge that they must complete in order to progress. However, it has been a known issue that sometimes not all of the enemies properly spawn into the playfield. This means the player is unable to complete the objective as the all enemies haven't been killed. The door would then remain locked, forever trapping the player. This would then force them to abandon the mission and lose all progress.

Despite this, Players retain all loot gained, but any Boons or positive effects they've acquired along the way are stripped -- as the run is considered finished. Boons are unique buffs which are ushered in via RNG, meaning a run can be extremely easy or incredibly difficult depending on which Boons you happen by. A 'Good Run' could be completely stolen from the Player because the game failed to do what it was designed to do; which is incredibly infuriating to say the least. This has been a problem since Beta, and unfortunately may still persist well into the Steam release. But that has yet to be determined as of the writing of this review.

Other Modes, such as Lightbringer; offer a unique experience with a variety of Lamps that a player can activate. These lamps provide not only a haven for the Player, but guide them toward a variety of objectives sprawled throughout the map. However, there was little care and foresight in the positioning of these lamps. If a Player is not careful they can find themselves trapped. They can descend from higher terrain into a gap between the lamp and a few rocks, rendering them unable to move. Since there is no handy recall function, this means the only way to escape is to die or to Abandon the mission entirely. Either way, this can spell the end of run via means beyond the player's control.


Overall the game isn’t bad, but it’s not a masterpiece either. There are far worse games out there. This is very much a solid value at $30 US, and I genuinely mean that. This game is far better than similar titles like Outriders. This has the benefit of several years of additional development, so it’ll be coming out the gate on Steam swinging. It’s far from the puttering fart of a game it was on Epic a few years back. I recommend it, but I outlined all of my hang-ups in this review so you can make a very informed purchase.

honestly its meh but, requires online to play single-player campaign and boots you if your internet disconnects."

When a $50 game going for $20 is enough to compete with the red flag of being 60% off, six months after release, you may be at an impasse of what to do. Not to fear, Gearbox has arrived to remind you that making a poor financial decision is always an option on the table.

Godfall is a weapon-porn simulator created by a California company where none of their 75 staff members ever stopped to ask if this was a good idea. You follow a character named Orrin, who leads a Vodyani-like civilization of people who only seem to exist in suits of armour and take on the characteristics of them. Your arch-nemesis is your bother and the narration is constantly floored that it has come to this.

It becomes increasingly clear that the people that came to work on this game from Destiny 2 were limited to the design and graphics staff, as characters’ one-dimensional lines perpetually embed a question of whether or not you’re playing a satire. Can the lines really be this bad? Surely it will pick up in the next dialogue!

Despite being the supreme military leader, you will never command your people in battle. Indeed, the entire war effort relies exclusively on your personal combat and resource-gathering prowess to sustain the faction. The function of your underlings is exclusively to cry at all hours how amazing it is to bask in your very presence, just in case staring at gleaming weapons wasn’t your kink after all.

Combat is interesting, and really it has to be because there’s nothing else holding this game together. The controls are a bit contrived and the commands seem sluggish to respond. I feel like a lot of games really focus the dodge tactic, a la Dark Souls, Hyper Light, etc. This one really focuses on blocking. Enemies always run faster than you and there’s an excellent chance that if you dodge laterally or diagonally, they will rotate with magical magnetic-gravity to whatever your position becomes, irrespective of physics. So, while dodging is a mechanic that exists, it’s unfeasible to use it most of the time.

This is similarly mirrored in weapons, of which a variety exist, though most are unfeasible to use. Each weapon type is accompanied by the same special attack, but they certainly aren’t all created equal. While dual swords are enjoyable to me in most games, in this one their special attacks do not passively charge, and only provide a grapple when it’s finally ready. Contrast this with a single sword type, which auto-charges two dash attacks, one of which has a four-auto-hit combo, or a polearm type where you can area-effect a ground slam. To use anything other than an effective weapon class would be self-sabotage, so why do they exist?

Levels are nonsensical and probably the biggest knife in the chest of this game. When you kill enemies, you recover weapons (or you buy them), those weapons have a damage and a rarity. At great expense, you can increase their rarity or improve their stats within the rarity to make them more effective. Weapons, no matter how improved, will always be rooted to the level you were when you bought or found them. Hold that thought for a moment.

You can play missions on low, medium, or hard difficulties. All this means is whether the enemies spawn slightly below your level (which they call the traditional experience (what?)), at your level, or slightly above your level. If you use a profoundly improved weapon, enemies at your level will be a cakewalk, but they will net you experience which will eventually make your weapon obsolete. At that point, you should just as well use almost anything you can find as a replacement.

In order to improve a weapon again, you’ll need money and resources, which you could gather in easy missions, but doing so will still increase your level and make more things obsolete. Like Oblivion, it’s really not in your interest to level up, as it results in power *regression* and not *progression* relative to everyone else. You cannot improve weapons as fast as they will become ineffective, so unless you’re heading out to do a one-off major thing, there’s really no point to investing in any item at all. Certainly don’t get attached to any weapons you find, you won’t be using them long and you can’t save their skins.

You can, indeed, change skins for your weapons and armour; however, 90% of the time, those skins are locked to areas that you only open up after beating the game. Meaning that if there is a look you quite like for your character or weapons, chances are you will need to play the entire game, without customisation, only to be able to use the skins for a few minutes after doing everything there was to do and turning the game off forever.

If the question is whether you should get this game for twenty bucks or a nice sandwich and dill spear,

My review is negative."

GodFall is a 3rd person hack and slash ARPG /looter, it is not a ""live service"" game and there are no micro transactions. It is just a clean cut ARPG/looter for solo and co-op players. If you enjoy creating powerful and fun builds in your ARPG and like grinding to perfect your build in-order to take on the games most difficult end game content then you will enjoy this game.

I was an original purchaser of the EPIC version on release and even though I enjoyed the gameplay, at that time the game was plagued with bugs, performance issues, and lack of content. Now with the release of the steam version ""ultimate edition"" the game is in a really good state and the Devs have provided almost every wanted feature their community asked for. With the hate this game got ( and still gets unfortunately), the devs could have easily abandoned this game but instead they took the constructive criticism the community gave them and provided everything that was asked for. So for that alone I have s lot of respect for the Devs.

What the game is GOOD at:

-Combat mechanics, are very weighty and satisfying with multiple classes of melee weapons (1 hand, duel wield, greatsword, warhammer, spears and the shield (which every class has access to).

-Visuals/animations - this game looks very good from its shiny textures (the art style is not for everyone) down to its smooth animations.

-Loot/Gear - - the gear in this game is very fun the play around with and like most good ARPGs you can define a unique build from the gear pieces you find.

- Build Variety - - This game is just so fun to try different builds because the game offers so many mechanics to build around. There is your typical status ailment builds including fire, ice/water, lighting, bleed, void, and poison (each of which have more to them then just tick damage). You can also make a build based around the Shield combat it you want. The valorplates (or classes) are also now differentiated by the new valorplate shards which can be unlocked to give powerful new mechanics/abilities, one example being calling forth a blizzard to deal water damage while you fight (so cool).

-Endgame - - the endgame is where this game shines with tons of modes to grind your preferred gear, challenge modes to test your build against the toughest encounters.

-Co-op - - this is one of those games where you can have a blast just hacking and slashing with friends, one endgame mode even allows up to 6 players at 1 time.

- Solo play - - This game is also soloable and no content is locked behind co-op or is impossible without others which I like a lot and wish more ARPG/looter games did this.

- (Mixed) Enemy Variety - - This game has a lot of interesting enemies to fight each originating from itheir own ""realms"" even has a nice bestiary to look at. This biggest issue is that none of the normal enemies get any sort of introduction so even though they are very mechanical and visually different they all seem to meld together, which was a missed opportunity imo.

- Current sale Price $29 is a steal with the content you are getting with this game.

- Performance - - Now I do have a RTX 3080 and Ryzen 3800x so my rig is not a slouch but I can play at 1440p maxed out (minus raytracing) and get a smooth 100-144fps without issues.

What the game is bad at / What this game is NOT:

- Story - - The story in the game is pretty generic and forgettable due to the lack of meaningful character development and single note story beats. The fire realm DLC had a lot more character then the main story but they still could have did a lot more with the lore/world they had. Funny enough the game has some interesting lore about its characters if you choose to read item descriptions but unfortunately it does not come through in the story at all.

- Online only - - Yes unfortunately this game is online only and requires an internet connection to play (No you don't need to sign in or create an account of any kind to play). While it currently does not effect me I understand why people don't like this practice and one can only hope the devs can make it playable offline as some point.

- It can be repetitive - - This is a looter where you will be doing a lot of endgame grinding to gear up your build, so you will be fighting the same bosses and sub boss over and over again, the new mode does give bosses interesting and new mechanics but as most looters go you need to set a goal to work/build towards otherwise it will feel like endless grinding. Now if your goal is to create the strongest builds possible to get up to (and beat) that really challenging content then this won't effect you as much.

- Visual Effects - - Some effects are way to bright and can block the screen when activated like the lighting bolts. It seems like the Bloom is way too high but it is a small issue.

- Bugs - - While I have not experienced any bugs there is 1 particular bug that can prevent you from using you shield or abilities when unlocking new valorplates. I believe the devs know and are working on a fix.

- This game is NOT like God Of War as others seem to indicate and if you go into this game expecting that you WILL be disappointed. The focus is not on story/characters/world, nor is it an action/adventure game. The most similarities this game has to God of War is its combat (which is one of the best parts) because some of the God Of War devs had their hand in this games development.

SUMMARY:

To sum it up, if you like ARPGs/looters for their builds, gear, and endgame and just want to jump in and grind /build your own powerful characters you will enjoy this game but if you are looking for anything else (especially story related) it may not hit the mark for you.

Overall I do recommend people try this game for themselves because this game is not what it was on launch and instead it is what it should have been at launch and more."

There is no denying that this game has many advantages and disadvantages. I have played for a long time and have a deep understanding of this game. Of course, what you can see is that this game has bad reviews on steam platform. Let me give you my opinions about this game.
First of all, this game should be classified in the third person action ""farm"" game, rather than the class ""dark-souls"" game. So if you compare it with the dark souls, you can refund or delete the game. It's really not that kind of taste... For me, this game is more similar to <Torchlight>. The main feature is to collect the best equipment and match it with your character. Of course, it is a third person sight game, not a god sight game. The plot of this game is relatively short. Many ""farm"" games are like this. They ignore the plot and focus on the equipment system. But this is harmless. Players who really like this kind of games won't care too much.
Next, let me talk about the advantages of this game. The graphs of this game are very exquisite. The scenes in the game are very big and the scenery are very beautiful. The appearance of armor and weapons are very cool, which is very attractive to the <Graph Quality> guys. Of course, many ""poor children"" paid a price for it.
Well, this game may only have these advantages. Aside from these, the rest are almost all disadvantages. This is also the reason that why the evaluation of this game can not rise. Let me give a few examples.
Such as, there is no map in the game. This is very unfriendly to new players, because many scenes in the game are large, and it is difficult for new players to find their way without a map. Although there are game arrows, but many players are not used to it.
Second, it was too difficult to deal with a group of monsters in the early game. Most of the time, when the monster is out of your sight, you can only see a red arrow to prompt the monster to attack you, it is difficult to find what skill it uses and how to avoid. As a result, you are often attacked by monsters covertly behind your back, which makes many players angry. However, it is worth mentioning that shield-block is an easy-to-use skill. Once you master it, it will reduce the difficulty for new players. This is also an advantage of the game. After all, hardcore gameplay like the <dark souls> is not for everyone.
In addition, there are many bugs in the game. This seriously affects the game experience. And the <Soul realm> mode in the game is very boring and time-consuming, and the rewards are also very bad. Once the game enters the later stage, the playing method is monotonous. Basically to say, except for the <Soaring tower> playing method and the <Extraordinary tower> playing method, other playing methods are very boring and time-consuming.
Unfortunately, the above is not the worst part of the game. As a single player game, this game only can be run online. You need to load every time you enter the game. However, the quality of the developers' servers are extremely poor. I think EA and Ubisoft's Inferior servers are better than developers. I have suffered a lot from this.
In my opinion, all kinds of bad factors add up to the fact that many players can't keep playing at the beginning, that's why the reputation of this game has gradually become so bad. If developers want to recover from the decline, they must fix bugs and improve playing methods, reduce the difficulty in the early stage and find ways to let new players continue to play, because the equipment system can only find joys in the later stage, that is, after level 50.
I don't know how long I can keep playing, but I know if the developer doesn't make any changes, the game will be over. It's up to you, man.
Finally, by the way, I saw a lot of people say a very interesting review. They said that game content planners should kowtow to art developers, Emm, I agree.

I was really looking forward to this game when it was announced and was disappointed to see that almost all the reviews of this game were either mixed or negative. I decided to not play the game and move on. However, recently I was running out of video games to play, so I thought ""meh……why not try out Godfall. Hopefully it won't be too bad""……..welp, I was wrong.

On paper, Godfall looks like it should be a great game. It's a loot slasher, which is very unique. The closest thing I can think of is Warframe, but even that's focused more on shooting than melee. Furthermore, the ""slasher"" component is very in-depth. The closest comparison I can make in regards to the combat is God of War, since Godfall has light attacks, heavy attacks, certain combos, charged heavy attacks, blocking, parrying, dodging, a rage mode, and certain ""special moves"" you can do that deal a lot of damage. That all looks like it should make for an in-depth combat system. This combined with a loot system like in Diablo sounds like the game should be a lot of fun.

The problem is that the game is simply not designed very well. Neither the ""looter"" component nor the ""slasher"" component. The looter component is designed very poorly because you fundamentally don't care what loot you get. You just equip whatever weapon/equipment has the highest main stats. While there's a bunch of secondary effects, they're typically nowhere near as important as the main stats (e.g. damage, health, etc…). While I imagine the loot becomes a lot more important in the end game and you create actual builds with the items, a good loot system should not take until the end game to get good. A good loot system should be engaging throughout the experience. For example, in Monster Hunter you never equip armor just because it has the highest defense. In fact, that's probably the least important aspect of the armor. You equip it because of the skills they provide, and are constantly thinking about which armor provides you the skills you want from the very beginning. Even in Path of Exile, you look forward to getting equipment that has 2 linked sockets then 3, 4, etc… In Godfall, I was never excited to find any loot.

The slasher component is not just poorly designed. It's HORRENDOUSLY designed. Like, I can accept a sub-par loot system. Most slashers don't have a great loot system anyways, and I can just wait until the end game until I can start enjoying the loot system. However, if the combat itself is not enjoyable, then there's no way I am going to waste hours of my time to MAYBE enjoy the loot system. The problem with Godfall's combat system is that none of the enemies are designed around the limitations of the player. For example, you will regularly face groups of enemies (around 3-6). Your character can really only attack one enemy at a time, yet you will very often get attacked by multiple enemies at once. A solution to this is to parry enemies, which stuns a group of enemies in front of you, or to use your special moves which stun a bunch of enemies at once. The problem with relying on parrying is that you will regularly be in situations where enemies are both in front and behind you (I mean hell, enemies can SPAWN behind you), so parrying will likely not stun all enemies. The problem with relying on your special moves is that they have a long cooldown, so you will likely be facing a new group of enemies once you've used your special move to defeat the previous group of enemies.

I could even accept sub-par enemies. Again, it's not like a lot of Hack-and-Slash games have the best enemies I've faced. Some are good, some are bad. While Godfall's enemies are hit and miss, overall they're ok. And hell, for some missions you can just run past the enemies and go straight to the bosses. Unfortunately, the last straw are the bosses themselves, as they're an even better example of how enemies are not designed around the limitations of the player. So with regular enemies, you can parry all of their attacks except their ""red"" attacks. So you can parry them quite often (i.e. parrying them is the rule, not the exception). However, for bosses you can only parry their ""blue"" attacks. Welp, bosses only have like 1 attack in their AI that's blue, so they only use it like once every 20 - 30 seconds (i.e. parrying them is the exception, not the rule). What are you supposed to do in the meantime? If you try to parry their other attacks, your character will get knocked back (WHY???!!!) and you might be able to get like one attack off before the boss moves onto their next attack. If you dodge their attack, your character will get off like maybe 2 attacks. Neither situation is very satisfying, since this isn't Dark Souls where you're satisfied with doing just 1 attack in between the bosses' attacks. In order to deal decent damage, you want to get off a full combo which is like 3-4 attacks. There was a relatively easy fix to this. Just design all bosses to be like Sekiro where the goal is parry each of their attacks, and have the reward for each successful parry be that the boss is stunned for a few seconds such that you can get off a full combo on them. I.e. instead of the EXCEPTION being that you can parry a boss's attack, make that the RULE and the exception be that there are rare attacks that can't be parried (i.e. make them similar to regular enemies). As it stands you only get rewarded for parries once every 20 - 30 seconds, and the reward for any other parry is that you simply don't take damage, which is lame.

There are also a few more unique situations which are also not fun to face. There are bosses that will douse an area around them with a DOT effect. This forces you to retreat from them, and then you have to just wait around for a few seconds until the boss comes close to you because you don't really have a ranged attack in this game. There's another boss which will shoot at you from range and when you get close to her, she'll teleport away and you have to repeat the process over and over again.

Like……none of this fun to face. It's not fun to have an enemy spawn behind you and interrupt your attacks as you're trying to combo down the enemy in front of you. It's not fun to only significantly damage a boss once every 20-30 seconds. It's not fun to randomly wait around every few seconds because the boss forced you to retreat. It's not fun to chase around a teleporting boss with a huge health bar. I've seen some YouTube videos of some end game builds, and they typically revolve around either spamming their special abilities which causes you to be invulnerable and does huge AOE damage, or getting ""over health"" which is basically another health bar so that you can just ignore enemy attacks and just keep attacking while you gain health (there are also passives that make you immune to getting interrupted). It's a bad sign when the end game is pretty much just built around ignoring anything that the enemy can do (i.e. so you don't have to dodge, guard, or parry) and just killing the enemies before they get to do anything.

I tried to give this game a chance and have fun. I really did. I tried using light attack combos, then heavy attack combos, then charged heavy attacks, then trying to exploit weakpoints, then solely parrying, etc… I even tried changing the difficult between Normal and Hard. Nothing seems to work and I am just not enjoying this game very much. This just goes to show that just because something looks good on paper, there's all sorts of design decisions that the developers have to make so that the game is actually FUN to play through. Godfall, unfortunately, is not."
godfall,Not Recommended,68.3,"Posted: April 12, 2022
Good:
-Graphics are nice.
-Visual design is very ""epic"".
-Battles against 1 enemy are good.
-Game treats player with indulgence concerning a lot of things: you can respec anytime (aside from battle), if you die, you just respawn nearby (regular bosses will restore all health, ""difficult"" bosses will restore their health to either 33%, 66% or 100% depending on how much they had when you died), very easy to parry.
-Every weapon (5 of them) feels very different.
-Adequate price.
-No microtransactions. At all.
-Little thing, but I really liked boss introductions. When game shows boss(/es) that you will be killing now or soon while doing cool music.
-Sanctuary is a nice character.

Bad:
-Sanctuary is the only character I felt something towards during story.
-Story itself is very simple and almost non-existant.
-Only 5 characters (including MC) with at least some personality in whole game(in original campaign, in in-game addon there is one more character with ""face"") and only 1 of them has actual face and face animations.
-Ending of the original campaign sucks.
-Ending of the addon sucks.
-Menus (especially ""augments"") feel very slow and uncomfortable to go through.
-Every armor set (12 of them) has its own equipment loadout and skillpoints - you'll have to allocate items and skillpoints for all of them separately.
-Almost no difference between armor sets, aside from visuals.
-Camera is bad. It just can't catch up to enemy and I have to wait, in the middle of battle, for it to turn around.
-Game punishes player for playing agressively and rewards for playing slow and defensively. Can't cancel animations, enemies sometimes ignore you attacking them and proceed with their own attacks, parries and counterattacks deal more damage and sometimes allow you to do a takedown on enemy, one of the skills allowes you to overcharge your shield and make it reflect 25% of damage back to attackers.
-Battles against more than one enemy suck. They're just unfair. Whenever you start attacking one enemy, you immediately get attacked from behind by several others. The little arrow near character that supposed to show that you have enemies behind you is useless and almost impossible to see during battle. Enemies constantly attack through each other. Game often locks your camera like you're dueling one of them and turns you back to other enemies. Aim assist is horrible, I often thow my shield into wrong enemy despite me looking at the one I want to hit.
-Some enemies' animations are too quick and abrupt. Grieves or Excelsious, for example.
-Many bosses will constantly spawn adds which is bad because ""Battles against more than one enemy suck"".
-Exploration sucks. No interesting encounters, just corridors and little arenas with enemies. Only interactables are: chests, resources (1 for each area) and lore notes.
-Shield throw is the only way to hit interactables that are hanging in the air during explorations. The problem is - it has a CD. What is the point of a cooldown for shield throw outside of battle? If I miss the thing I need to hit I will have to just stand on one place for 30 seconds waiting for it to recharge. Why isn't it a free ability outside of battle without any CD or with very little CD (around few seconds max).
-Tower of loot is boring to play solo.
-Spirit realm mode is boring and very uncomfortable to play solo (have to constantly jump between realms to fight different enemies, can hold only 5 souls, etc.). It's obvious that these modes were made for coop.
-Lightbringer could be fun, but no - you just annihilate packs of enemies, but now with a timer and constant health decerease.
-Poise system is broken. You are a walking armor set, yet the enemy can just push you with his left hand and you will fall down on the ground. You, on the other hand, smash them with a giant two handed hammer and they dont give a ♥♥♥♥, unless you attack in a specific ""weakspot"" timing.
-How the hell do you manage to ♥♥♥♥ up lock on? Well, apparently devs managed to do even that. During boss battles camera randomly stops following boss and he just dissapears behind me.
-A lot of little inconvenient things that shouldn't be in game, like 30 seconds timer after the mission that you can't cancel or skip (apparently, you can skip that, my fault), no option to copy and paste allocated skillpoints to another armor set or inability to unequip all augments with one button instead of removing them one by one.
-Ah, yes. Another ""little"" thing: NO MAP. In a game where every world can almost be described as a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ labyrinth. Who, the ♥♥♥♥, designed this game?! Do they even have a video game experience?
-Bugs. Got stuck and had to restart last 20 minutes of game. Interface bugged and started blinking, had to restart the game several times for it to disappear. Some of items in inventory can become ""locked"" and you won't be able to dispose of them in any way. What is the point of locked items anyway, just allow me to salvage them no matter if they're equipped! Also, one of the story missions is bugged, if you destroy tethers before getting the mission to destroy them (which I did during my first playthrough) you'll have to restart the mission, because game will be waiting for you to destroy them, even though they are already destroyed.

I would only recommend the game if you have 1 or 2 friends to play with and it is on sale."

One of the best bad games I’ve played. $40? No. $20. Sure. Everything people have said about it is true. Boring story, poor UI, poor performance, bugs, mind boggling deaths, etc.

Yet I’m still playing it. I like the combat and seeing how much damage I can do. I like some of the Valorplates and weapons combos. I like the augments. The Ascendant Trials are madness with their ridiculous banes (looking at you “take 330% damage while sprinting” in a timed mode). The spirit realm is fine. Lightbringer is okay. Lots of loot if you’re into that.

Bottom line: if you’re a masochist with $20 to spare, try it out when it goes on sale."

If per chance, way back in the 360 days, you played Too Human and thought ""hey I'm having fun, what's with the reviews?""

Then you'll probably like this game too.

Simple, to-the-point loot and skill tree that is meaningful without getting lost in the weeds. Some of the stats can be surprising and creative, like a stun when consuming a heal or a summon when executing a certain type of finisher on an enemy. With no live service in sight, this feels like a ""comfort food"" game you can return to when you just want to bash some enemies for drops.

Three difficulty levels you can choose at any time; Hard mode feels like what the game was designed around and is a satisfying challenge without feeling unfair. Mob groups are fun, requiring attention to positioning and often fielding support enemies that heal or buff from the rear. Bosses make tasteful use of adds.

No matchmaking until max level, but interestingly you can create a max-level endgame character (or boost an existing character) at any time from the Character Select menu. I haven't tried this and am personally enjoying the leveling experience, but props to them for including the option. You can otherwise co-op through the entire game with a private party of 3. Parties are scaled, so no worries about being too far ahead of a friend.

I think my main critisism would be the clunky equipment UI - swapping and sorting gear feels more sluggish than it should, with slow menu transitions and one too many button presses. I personally got used to it but it's strange considering the rest of the game feels tight."

Another ""No Man's Sky"" Comeback Story

TL:DR - In its current state, Godfall is an incredible game for anyone who likes melee combat and ARPG's. For $30-40, the complete version here on Steam is a steal and has hundreds of hours of content with an engaging ""end-game"". Highly recommended, both for solo play and even more for coop. People who hate any game that's an Epic exclusive and some who played the original release likely won't ever give the current version of Godfall a real chance, but if you are unsure whether Godfall is for you, the tutorial takes about an hour to complete and will give you a solid overview of the game and combat style. With Steam's 2-hour window for automatic refunds, this allows a no-risk trial of the game so there's no need to listen to the ""haters"" or ""fanboys"" as you can judge for yourself.

Background - Let's get right to it, Godfall had a rough start. As an Epic Games exclusive, gamers were already unhappy with it before it even launched. On top of that, the original version of the game was buggy and lacking in content after the main campaign. By most accounts, it wasn't a terrible game even at launch, but it had definitely over-promised and under-delivered. Many people who only ever played the original version and/or never played it at all since it was Epic Exclusive have already made up their mind about it; something to be aware of while reading discussions.

Current State (pre-Exalted patch) - Despite the rocky start, the developers have stuck with the game, constantly improving it, fixing bugs, and adding content. Even today with the Steam launch, the game is being updated with one of the largest content patches (Exalted Update) as well as a host of further improvements. The game is now a unique, polished gem with hundreds of hours of diverse content that any ARPG and/or melee combat fan should try. For Steam users, this game initially being an Epic Exclusive just means that you now get a much improved version, with far more content, for less than half the price.

Game Details - So what is Godfall, and what makes it stand out? Broadly, it is a 3rd person, melee-combat-focused solo and coop ARPG with diverse end-game content. Some key features (in no particular order):

-Gorgeous graphics, especially on a high-end PC. At 4k/ultra settings on a 4k/HDR compatible TV/Monitor, an RTX 3080 is just able to maintain a consistent 60fps, and at these settings it is probably the nicest looking game I've ever played. Not as ""realistic"" as something like Red Dead Redemption 2, but equally beautiful. Don't worry though, at lower 1440/1080 resolutions, you won't need a ~$1000 GPU to run the game well and still have it look good.

-Although there are no ""classes"" in the game, there is a tremendous amount of customization possible via the use of 12+ ""Valorplates"", along with further equippable and customizable gear and talent trees.

-Combat is definitely the highlight of the Godfall experience and also the hardest to convey in writing. I'll attempt to do so, but before that I want to reiterate anyone who is on the fence should play through the ~1 hour tutorial and then decide. If the combat doesn't suit your taste, you can always refund the game before the 2 hour mark. Getting back to it, Godfall's combat is fast-paced and action-oriented, while at the same time being skill-based and challenging. I haven't ever played anything else I would say is truly similar to Godfall's combat. If I had to compare it to other games, I'd say think of something like Elden Ring or Nioh and blend it with Monster Hunter or Warframe. The combat is faster, more fluid, and less clunky than the popular ""soulslike"" games, but more impactful, challenging, and tactical than Monster Hunter or Warframe.

-Apart from a lengthy main campaign, there are a large and diverse number of ""end game"" activities to participate in, including a roguelike mode.

-No microtransactions. When you buy Steam's version of Godfall, that's it. You never need to decide whether you should spend X hours grinding for premium currency or paying Y dollars to unlock something, get a cosmetic, etc. This also means that the game wasn't designed to push microtransactions at the cost of good gameplay design like so many ""F2P"" ARPG's."

The dictionary definition of mediocre in almost every respect and chock full of really odd design choices. It is only worth getting for around 15$ or less, even with the added content that the ‘Ultimate Edition’ comes with.
Behold a list of this games sins (that I can remember)!
• Story is completely forgettable, it has no impact and nothing you do is really making any difference as hey you can just replay any of the missions anyway for that sweet GRIND!
• Quest variety is terrible, they re-use enemies and the same objectives constantly, even in Story missions expect to see the same mini-bosses at least twice.
• No mini map or overall map whilst in quests. All you get is a marker that roughly points in your main objectives direction.
o It will only point to optional objectives if they are visible/close by.
o It will often get lost and try to tell you to walk through impassable walls.
• All of the Valorplates feel the same, the visuals are their only distinguishing feature. They all share the same skills and have no unique abilities.
• Big weapons (Greatswords, Polearms, Hammers etc) are so slow that you will be punched in the face repeatedly by the time you get an attack off. Fast weapons are really your only viable choices.
• When you unlock a new ability (which are rare), the game will obnoxiously place a “Try out your new ability in the training ground!!!!” type prompt on screen at all times in the Sanctum (hub area) until you actually go do it….even if you’ve already used it in quests.
• In the original game (not the small expansion) there are basically 2 cutscenes, one at the start and one at the end. The rest of the “story” is told through stilted conversations and people speaking at you while you just want to do a quest.
• Some boss fights have mechanics that don’t work or are so inconsistent that they aren’t worth trying to use.
• If you die there is basically no penalty, 90% of the time you just respawn right next to where you died with all your consumables back and you can just keep going. So no fear of death!
• When you do die, Seventh Sanctum (the constant voice talking at you) will repeatedly say the same 3 lines of dialogue that are all awful.
• The chests that require you to break seals to open are often full of the worst loot. Que?!
• Most optional conversations during the story are about 3 lines of dialogue and are pointless.
• Spirit Vision is introduced as a mechanic that is basically never needed for the Story. Ever.
• Spirit Vision when it is needed or when you want to use it, is broken in HDR. It makes the screen so bright and blots out most of what you want to actually see. This is a known issue that has not been addressed.
• Every area is built the same, just with a different theme to it. All are a series of paths that lead to small open spaces with enemies in. Rinse repeat.
• Almost every enemy has some kind of knock down attack, because the idea of being put down on the floor over and over is mega fun!
• The final boss (of the expansion) is quite the joke and forces you to do really cheesy tactics to win. I think the devs need to play more Dark Souls or Sekiro to see what a fun AND challenging boss fight is like.
• Grind and repetition. Its. Everywhere.
The TL;DR of this game is that the technical artists and people who made it look shiny are the only ones that seemed to understand their job. The rest is extremely mediocre, forgettable and there is little reason to play it more than once and for a deep sale price."

I was enjoying this game a lot up to the point where I faced one of the worst game designs I have ever experienced, and now I'm literally soft-locked.

I was playing the game on normal (default setting). I was in the first realm and finally got to the boss of that realm. He obliterated me, so I realized I was rushing the content, so decided to do some side quests, explore the maps, level up, get some more loot and upgrade my equipment.
I ended up a few levels above the boss with pretty good gear. Finally, beat him, so now I unlocked a new mission, where I need to climb a tower to ascend to the next realm.
While climbing that tower, you need to do some small tasks. One of them was killing 5 enemies using soul shatter.

Soulshatter is a mechanic of the game where you need to hit an enemy multiple times with the light attack to build up a meter. After it's full, you can release a powerful special heavy attack called soul shatter.
The problem is... at that level, with my gear, I was obliterating enemies and I'm not able to build up the meter. I tried to use the least powerful sword in the game, but still, I was killing enemies before being able to soulshatter.

The only thing I can think of would be to set the game to hard. Maybe it would make the enemies tough enough to endure my level. But I am still baffled by that and I don't feel like keep playing. I have never played a game where I need to increase the difficulty and use weaker weapons (after grinding for a better weapon, because let us not forget that this game is a LOOTER, so you are supposed to grind for better gear) just so I pass a single challenge."

updated: Grinding is real-steep for the endgame, and it is a challenge. They are fun to play. Builds and Gears play important role as much as your skills. The only downside is that they are pretty much much optimized for co-op plays, there are matchmaking, but hardly get any. You can solo them, but it is not as effective.

My impression so far is that Godfall is an older-action-rpg-styled game injected with modernized gameplay, resulting in a weird packaged yet fun to play game. For this current price, it is not a bad deal at all. I am having more fun with it than some newer games.

Combat is far more methodological than it appears. There is no animation canceller. Button mashing is not effective. Positioning and timing is much more vital. The overall combat flow needs some time to get used to. While not there yet, I can see that Gears and Builds will change how you approach the combat.

It lacks modern features like map and minimap, but you are constantly guided by marker. The map is quite linear, despite having multiple paths. You cannot just get lost unless you are ignoring everything the game offers.

It needs more QoL touches here and there. The must-be-online to play is sad, but is not a deal breaker. I would say give it a try if you are interested. 2hrs time is more than enough to tell whether you like this game or not."

Godfall is one of those tragic launch from which a game never recovers.
Marketing mistakes were made, a shot was missed.

But I garantee you that beneath that terrible communication mess, is a gem.
Now Godfall is not for everyone. But suffices to say that if you liked a game like the recent God of War, you may very well love this Counterplay Games product !


WHAT WENT WRONG ?
==================
Godfall was first teased in late 2019, and ever since showed itself as a singleplayer action game.
Thing is : Godfall's story campaign is a big tutorial preparing players for the main activity : co-op endgame modes.
Simply put, every player who dropped the game before finishing the campaign... never actually saw what the game was all about !
And sure the campaign is not that catchy, but very shallow if you ask me. The lore looks gorgeous, but the narrative and staging are boring. There's no wondering why people stopped playing. As a game advertised with fancy story cinematics and trailer, it was a let down. The solo experience never lived up to the hype it started.
Godfall never even bothered to give a deep look at its shiny endgame content, the core of it design !

And to be fair, Godfall endgame activities loop is rather limited and repetitive, and despite the generosity of its many systems, the game should have cost less. If it were me I'd have sold this product between 20€ and 25€. As it stood, stamping it 70-80€ at release was a ballsy bet as surreal as to sell a new Counter-Strike at 60€.


WHAT IS THE REAL GODFALL
=======================
I would describe Godfall as a ""strategic action arena brawler"" : you are given various enemies (and bosses) combinations in various sized areas, and have to clean them in order to advance further. While doing so, you get a ton of XP, colored loot and currencies, allowing you to build crazy loadouts of equipements and skills; in order to crush the arenas even more confidently the next time, and show who's the boss.
This game is a powerplay race, and a creative buildup sandbox. All you do in Godfall is designed around customizing and upgrading your character.
Now the campaign, while not much thrilling, is still a nice tutorial to learn the outstanding amount of fighting elements within gameplay and get used to the rythm and general choregraphy of battles. It's also very good to study the enemies, which you'll come across in endgame content as well.

Although the main game modes (Towers) are feasable alone, it is way funnier with friends ! Because on top of your own character builds, there's an opportunity to develop teamplay synergies : you can hit enemies of course, but Godfall also allows to heal or buff allies through many items and abilities !


HOW WILL YOU PLAY ?
==================
As said above, each player has loadouts, 3 of them. It's very useful to experiment or just store a solo or co-op kit depending your mood.
There are MANY ways to play the game and fight through. I can't stress it enough.

For a starter, there are 12 preset characters called ""Valorplates"". Each one of them comes with fixed passive and active talents. Each Valorplate also has 4 unique ""specialization"" (shards) from which you can pick 2. You can level up your character up to Level 450 !

Then, the loadout building revolves around :
- 8 equippable items, including 2 weapons, 2 rings, 1 charm, 1 amulet, 1 Lifestone (healing token) and 1 banner
- 9 augments (passive buffs for offensive, defensive and other purposes)
- 50 skill points (to allocate within 125 skills)
- 450 ascension points (to allocate in all kind of stat %)

Each equippable items comes with main effects, and random secondary traits
Use the Forge in the lobby in order to roll new neat traits and upgrade items grade !

Also, players have 3 main attributes influenced by equipped stuff : Vitality, Might and Spirit. Some Augments can react more efficiently depending your highest attribute.

Then there is the genius of Godfall : gameplay systems !
Counterplay Games created a lot of different gameplays to pick from to make your fighting style unique.
Here are some :
- Shield specials (bash, throw, parry, smash the ground etc)
- Weak point (aim for enemies weaknesses for additionnal damage)
- Critical damage (increase your critical chance and its damage)
- Damage over time (affect enemies with devastating poison, burns, frost, bleed etc)
- Banner (specialize in AOE buff by deploying powerful banners)
- Overheal (extra temporary life to exploit and become unkillable)
- Breach (fill in enemies stun bar to break their defense and incapacitate them)
- Archon Fury (unleash temporary buffs with rage)
- Polarity (switch back and forth between your weapons to hurt enemies and get buffs)
- Blessings (under certain fight conditions, earn unique buffs)
- Rampage (hit enemies as much and often as possible to gain extra damage)
- Weapon techniques (attack enemies with locked unstoppable hits)
- Weapon timing (time your hit accurately for bonus effects)
- Siphon (who needs lifestones when you can leech enemies life)
- Soulshatter (mark enemies until a single heavy blow destroy them)
- Takedown (finish enemies with powerful and badass execution)
- Parry (if well timed, a good parry can provide useful effects)

I didn't go into the details, but you can have a pretty good idea of how interesting and entertaining it is to mix some of these systems with each other. And with other players builds in co-op !
As a matter of fact, it is quite fascinating to browse Youtube for build tutorials. You can see how devoted and passionate is the community.


WHAT IS GOOD IN GODFALL ?
=====================
- Fighting feedbacks are dope
- Game is visually and artistically stunning
- It's God of War, but sped up
- Generous character building
- Many different playstyles
- Team synergy is fun
- There is an in-game codex that explains pretty much any mechanics or terms

WHAT IS BAD IN GODFALL ?
=====================
- Disappointing campaign
- Endgame loop is very repetitive and the grind is strong. So it is highly advised to group up with other players.
- Inventory filters are... functionnal. But far from exhaustive.
- Towers require a ressource cost in order to be played.
- The Training room doesn't allow to set enemies level
- Still a few bugs
- Matchmaking loading required even if you are matched already in a private group
- The controls are sometime confusing (at least on keyboard)


HOW TO PLAY CO-OP TODAY ?
========================
There is a discord group named ""Godfall LFG"", you can ask for in the steam forum. There are lots of members and even if we aren't millions remaining, the matchmaking is easy and the people are nice and helpful."

The best way to summarize my feelings about Godfall is that I find it relatively terrible--yet at the same time, I kind of like it? I think? I'm not even sure anymore. This is a game that sucks the emotions straight from my soul to create a very illogical response. It's kind of boring, but at the same time--I keep playing it. I don't know what is wrong with me. Where did I go wrong in my life?

To begin with this ""review"", I think that it's best to acknowledge the Warframe comparison. To put it bluntly, it does have similarities. Straight down to the very loose feeling, Godfall is essentially Warframe minus the guns. Hell, you even have multiple ""Warframes"" (they are called Valorplates in Godfall) like in...well...Warframe. The major difference is that Godfall doesn't offer as many weapons. You have your hammer, your greatsword, your one-handed sword, dual blades, and a spear. And that's it. That's all you got. Nothing more, nothing less. You can equip two weapons that you can switch between via the tap of a key (or a button). For the most part, I found myself constantly switching between weapons as I leveled. However, I wasn't really a fan of the hammer--it seemed a bit TOO slow compared to the other weapons and the damage didn't really seem to make up for the fact that I was taking a bit too many hits while using it.

Other than that--the combat has moments where it feels relatively tedious. I played on normal for the most part, eventually switching to easy difficulty because I just didn't care anymore. I needed any incentive to just finish the base game. I didn't really feel like the combat changed at all in the entire time that I played the game. It felt generic no matter what weapon I used and I wasn't gaining any new abilities or anything like that. It was just a very simplistic experience that didn't particularly seem fleshed out. I kept getting this overwhelming feeling that all I was doing was tapping two or three buttons while spamming the ""evade"" key. Nothing intuitive, nothing that stood out. It was just meh.

Moving on to the story, it's meh. Nothing about it was interesting. It kind of sucked and the voice acting was absolute trash. Not like funny trash either. It was just cheesy bad all over. There was never a point where I actually cared about anything going on and the annoying voice actors made me hate the characters even more. It's been a while where I played through an entire game and found myself disliking the entire cast. This includes the main protagonist (who you play as) named ""Orin"". Orin's voice actor changes depending on the appearance of the Valorplate that you are using. If you are using a masculine Valorplate, then you get the male voice and vice versa. It doesn't matter because both voice actors are terrible.

One of the few positives is that I actually like the way that Godfall looks. There is something very appealing about the area design. Each set of areas looks and feels very unique. The color and the lighting are quite impressive. Unfortunately, this is kind of ruined because the game doesn't run all that well. I'm using a 2080S and I wasn't able to play the game without experiencing an occasional stutter here and there. I ended up having to lower the settings, which made the game quite ugly, just to get it to not run terribly and thus ultimately ruining any positive thoughts I had on the graphical prowess of the game. To put it lightly, if you have a set-up that can actually run the game on ultra without stutters, it's quite nice looking. If you can't, it's gross to look at.

In closing, Godfall kind of sucks. It doesn't do anything remarkable enough to stand out against better games. It's a generic loot game with mediocre combat. That being said, if you have nothing better to do with your life (like myself), then you may find yourself enjoying Godfall. It's a nice little waste of time. However, I must say that for the current promotional price ($29.99), it's hard to suggest. I would say waiting for a bigger discount would be the best bet. It's just not good enough to justify costing $29.99-$39.99. There's far better titles out there for similar prices. That being said, I'm recommending it--but only if it's cheap because there is something about the game. It's not like the worst thing ever, it's just very average. It doesn't do enough, but it doesn't really commit any carnal sins. It's just an alright game."

Been trying my best to finish the story mode, some Tower run and stuff.
But the BUG man. There is too much bug.

You manage to kill a boss? Bam. The boss glitched.
Now you're at floor 22 in ascended tower? Bam. no mob spawn.
Oh? you just cleared a Dark-Light quest? Bam. CTD.

Now im stuck at whatever bosses at Fire Realm. Wont be replaying the game once uninstalled. Aside the game required for you to ONLINE, i doubt the game would last for another 5 years. That's just a bad move."

godfall,Recommended,54.5,"Posted: March 28
Let me start with this, The game has some faults; its got a few annoying bugs here and there (mostly visual), its got a very limited player base, and its probably not going to have a lot of updates.

Even still, I CANT STOP PLAYING!

What it DOES have is; stunning visuals, skill choices that have a very nice impact on game-play, satisfying loot fountain after harder missions(really makes the longer/very difficult missions rewarding enough that i want to grind them), It has an AMAZING codex that gives you ALL the information that you would ever need to make informed decisions on where to take your build to meet ANY challenge(more on this later), The loot system has an ARPG feel to it where there is a crazy high ceiling to the power level of the items, the combat is engaging(parry mechanics, dodge rolls, power meters) but also lets you build for simple passives where you can get all your hack and slash button MASH action, and as of now, 30 odd hours into the game, i feel like there is still PROGRESSION! my items are getting better, my ascension levels are getting me more stats(and there are thresholds in ascension that give you game-play enhancing buffs ig... 10% increased dodge roll window ),and there is a few upgrade mechanics im still working up to! Content that i could barely do a week ago i can breeze through and there is STILL more to go above that!

you can play the game just mashing buttons and cleaving monsters chugging life stones [healing flasks] and make it through a LOT of the content in the game, but unless you invest time and effort into your build, you WILL hit a wall. AND THAT'S WHAT DIFFICULTY IS. To the people complaining about this, do you really want to have every end game monster be a meat sponge? do you want to be able to just IGNORE damage and knock back so you can sit and mash your buttons? I mean come on its SUPER satisfying to be able to parry that BLUE attack and have the enemy that has been wiping the floor with you just SIT THERE and take some punishment back, weaving in the skills between damage windows, using the ""Timing Attack'' in a safe spot where you know its going to be effective, and YOU STILL, no matter what, can just dodge roll infinitely to a safe spot since it has no cost. Its a really nice mix of precise combat and forgiving features that you can have hard endgame and it not feel like everything is just a stat check.

i have said it a few times, but your ""Build"" is the combination of items, skills, augments, ascension points, and valorplate that you are using. The skill trees all KINDA end up similar since the skill tree doesn't limit you too much on skill points(there is still a few notable archetypes that being said), But, the real build progression comes from your might/spirit/vitality priorities, the stat increases on your items,(these increases can directly buff specific skill points making BUILDS possible) and augments. Augments can have DRASTIC game-play changing affixes to them that make play styles all on their own. ascension perks CAN all be filled out with enough grinding but you can make a path through them that fits what you like. Valorplates decide a LOT about your build make sure to look at the different SHARD abilities and unlockables on each of them to find the one that fits your liking the best! there is a nice variety.

I like the ARPG item upgrade mechanics in the game, kill big bad it drops loot fountain, kill BIGGER BAD it drops higher rarity loot fountain, go to bigger bad zones get things that buff the bigger bad or nerf YOU and when you kill the supercharged bigger bad it drops more and better loot. and you can insert ""Big Event' for ""big bad"" and that describes a good bit about the game modes. The miscellaneous loot from these events is all used to upgrade items, and at the final upgrade tiers, you have the ability to make items REALLY strong, But i will say, there is also a ""make it or break it"" feeling from items that makes it a bit disappointing if the item you have been grinding for doesn't ""hit"" the perk you want. Although that is something that i personally find FUN. It makes me really happy when i HIT and get the NUTS item i wanted!

The codex, if you have a question about a game mechanic, its probably in the codex. if you have a question about an annoying enemy. its probably in the codex. if you want a refresher on what your skill or ability scales with. its probably in the codex. The game doesn't even need a wiki with how amazing the codex is. its probably in the codex.

The Price, the game is priced a bit too high, not due to the content being bad, but because it's future doesn't seem bright.
low player count, no cross platform, and really no updates for FAR too long. But IF YOU EVER see this on sale and its within your budget. AND you like ARPG's, flashy abilities, tons to collect, theory crafting, and challenging endgame.

GET THIS GAME
you will not be disappointed with what it has to offer"

godfall,Not Recommended,76.6,"Posted: April 11, 2022
Initially; for the first couple hours, I enjoyed the game a lot.
It felt like a mixture of Darksiders 2, Destiny 2, Warframe, and a few other games that scratched an itch. But that enjoyment quickly turned into an annoying disappointment. Annoying so much that I almost smashed my keyboard - and I'm someone that has finished souls games without ever getting that urge, that should tell you something perhaps.

Multiplayer is barebones
There is no matchmaking outside the endgame activities. There's multiplayer, where you can invite your friends and do the story missions and whatnot, but the matchmaking is reserved for the endgame activities. Multiplayer uses their dedicated servers; no P2P. It may sound like a good thing, but to be honest, I wish P2P was a thing. Playing with a friend only to experience latency isn't a good thing. And god knows what servers you are connecting to when you are playing online, latency on my end was horrible to be honest. I wish the game used P2P instead of dedicated servers... oh also, there are no communication tools. No chat, no emotes, nothing. Just a button that marks something.

There is no cross-platform multiplayer. EGS / Steam / Xbox family / PS family are all separate. Developers have said that they'll add EGS to Steam cross multiplayer someday, but the experience I had with a few multiplayer games (which took minutes to find, by the way) was bitter. The latency killed the whole experience for me that I went back to solo...

One thing I really like about the game is, light attacks building something up called soulshatter. It's another bar that builds up on the enemy HP bar, backwards. After building up some soulshatter, a heavy attack will take off that chunk immediately. And also, both light and heavy attacks do breach damage to enemies, and when the breach bar is filled, the enemies get stunned. It encourages you to mix things up, which is really great.

Another thing I like is the weakpoints. They are revealed after an enemy attacks, or you use some specific stuff. Hitting a weakpoint deals extra damage, and can knock smaller enemies down. Against some enemies, you can even stun them briefly. It's a nice addition to the genre that should stay, in my opinion.

There's a feature that the game doesn't tell you. After the tutorial, you can create a new character or boost your existing one to the max level and jump right into the endgame. There are several endgame activities.

As far as the gameplay goes, there are a lot of enemy attacks that knock you down, and the amount of time you spend hugging the floor is too much. That combined with the amount of enemies you face that can knock you down, you spend a lot of time hugging the floor.

Dodging feels extremely stiff and clunky. The game encourages you to parry with an extremely generous parry window, however everytime you parry, the screen flashes bright white as if you are flashbanging yourself. Any bright effect should have a toggle to disable the said effect. And there are many more effects on the screen that sometimes I don't know what the ♥♥♥♥ is going on. Imagine Warframe with Physx effects enabled, back in the day. It's that bad, in my opinion.

None of the ""Valorplates"" (characters) I played as felt unique as they don't have an active skill. Well, technically they do, but it's a very slow-charging active that provides you with a super buff for a certain duration, so it felt more like a passive than an active. They all have passives and a few other things that make them inclined towards certain builds, but the lack of actives made them feel like copy/pastes for me.

You unlock something called ""Shards"" and can equip two of the four that are designed specificly per Valorplate. They spice things up and further (zero + further = further) define the distinctness between every Valorplate, however the way they do things is extremely counter-intuitive for me. There are a lot of ifs; if you strike an enemy affected by this ailment with that attack, you do this and that... blah blah. Just give me 4 active skills, and let me choose 2 of them. Just let me use them without having to set everything up first, or having to rely on a shared attack that every Valorplate has access to.

That's the problem with ""Shards"". Their effects are somewhat unique, but the triggers are not. And more often than I'd like, as there are lots of enemies going at you at the same time, building something up feels like a chore. I ended up playing as the Valorplate that can parry the red (unblockable) attacks, and whenever I parry/block something I store some of its damage which I can unleash with a shield-bash. Simple, and straightforward, unlike all other shards in my opinion.

The game is in dire need of diversification. Shards do their best, the rest are meh. Everyone gets to use the same passives, same weapons, same this and same that. Some Valorplate specific passives and Shards might encourage you to use something specific, but other than that all feel like copy/pastes to be honest. Imagine Destiny 2 or Warframe where everyone had the same guns, same animations, same powers, with slight differences or some additional effects for some stuff. That's what you have in this game, in my opinion.

Inventory management becomes a nightmare. You have unlimited inventory (as far as I can tell), however as there is no crafting and no re-rolling, the game encourages you to keep whatever you find, even the blues and purples. Because they can be upgraded to oranges.

Lack of re-rolling is felt as the itemization has extreme variation - and this isn't a good thing. Without proper limitations to the affixes, with lots of affix variations per slot, the effect of having no re-roll options or controlled crafting has a tax on inventory, and the inventory management itself. I had a similar problem in Division 2; game encouraged to hoard stuff for different types of builds and playstyles, but it also had a limited inventory. The expansion to Division 2 solved all of those problems by adding a superb crafting system, in my opinion.

There are sorting and filtering options, however they are pretty basic. You can check what you want to see, but not not what to see; I might want to see items with this affix, but not that one, and that's not possible.

Also, the UI for augments (special item slots) is horrible. That UI especially needs drag & drop functionality, or an easier way to move / remove items from their slots. Or, finding another of the same augment without going through hundreds of them... etc... etc... the UI is weak for inventory management, but it is felt extremely especially for the augments.

'm gonna stop here. In my opinion, this formula - mixing melee combat with a looter has great potential, but this game misses the point in my opinion. The combat feels nice when it works and you are not hugging the floor, to be honest. Then some enemies start hitting you off-screen and it turns into Dark Souls 2 where you are getting ganged up. Shesh,,,

One thing to note is, what have the developers added to the game till now. If they keep at it like that, I feel like this game can turn into a great one someday that I'll enjoy completely, instead of having a love-hate relationship with it. Add some real active skills per Valorplate, chop the amount of ifs for the shards down, add more weapons, make shields an actual slot and shields with different effects, etc... I can suggest a lot of stuff.

I've never felt like this for any game before to be honest, initially I was enjoying it immensely, then all of a sudden I started to hate it. Lack of P2P kills the multiplayer for me, and solo drives me nuts from time to time... I'm still playing it to see if it'll get any better though. Because that itch needs scratching."

The only thing that is good in this game is the combat which is actually really fun. Everything else is just bad.
The story is trash and you can basically finish it in 5 hours playtime. The maps are super small, linear and boring, so are the different game modes where you basically fight the same 5 bosses from the story mode over and over again...

Who ever made the 3 difficulty ratings has NO clue what the word ""difficulty"" even means. The difference between ""easy"" and ""normal"" is basically non-existant but oh boi if you decide to go on hard mode. I played the game with 2 friends. Normal mode, all enemies died in 2 seconds. Hard mode? Every attack from the minor to boss enemies are a 1 shot (don't even get me started about the devs loving stuns) + the devs thought it was a good idea to make the people port back in the base after 3 deaths so the group has to endure another 5 minute long loading screen where someone might not even get ported.
The game modes are made to have a unfun experience. If you wanna upgrade your Valorplate you need to unlock different shards. The requirements are just dumb and frustrating. Reach lvl 15 in Ascendend Tower - die at room 13 and you just wasted 1+ hour on NOTHING cause you gotta redo the whole thing from floor 1.
Finish a Lightbringer after sealing 3 Dark Tears. All easy until you reach the very last wave where its 5 yellow bar enemies spawning that all perma stun the player.

The game could be very good but sadly it really is not and I am glad I only spend 15 bucks on it. This game is defo NOT worth 40 bucks!"

I'm playing Godfall for the very first time and I came across some negative reviews early on due to it being very loot focused, but I have to say - I'm really enjoying it. The developers described it quite well: ""We wanted to create an experience that was fun to play solo, better with friends, and with none of the hassles or FOMO of a live-service product with microtransactions."" - and in my opinion they definitely succeeded with that intention.

It looks gorgeous, it's a lot of fun to play - that's all I really wanted from this particular game.
The loot itself is also beautifully crafted and a joy to look at in your inventory.

Definitely recommend!"

Got this on sale, and for the first couple of hours, yeah, I found it fun. This is a mindless hack and slasher to be sure. RPG elements are not that deep, and the story is as about as generic as you can get. The core gameplay is fun, and the worlds are beautiful, but if you're looking for an ARPG with depth, look somewhere else. But if you want the videogame equivalent of banging your pre-teen action figures together, this is the game for you.

...........................damn, now I want some Godfall action figures

EDIT: Jesus, okay, after 20 hours, I can say that the killing blow for this game is the lack of a community. I swear, all this game needs is people to play with, and it immediately would become five times as fun. And I know you could say the same for playing anything, but this feels like it was made for party play, and much of the issues I've had playing this game, from the tedium in the spirit realm to the difficulty in the tower and dreamstones would be alleviated with multiplayer.

This game needed a community to keep it entertaining for endgame, but since it crapped the bed on release, nobody's playing, and the single player experience past the campaign is just hollow. Here's the thing, a lot of the progression mechanics mean nothing without other people to compare and show things to, so even the act of making your character better loses it's luster after a while. I still recommend this game, I got almost thirty hours out of it, and most of it was enjoyable, but there's just no value in the endgame without other people. And as I've both heard and experienced, the expansion Fire and Darkness is very anti single player.

Get this if you plan on playing with friends, it's on sale, or you have the understanding that you will likely get bored after beating the base campaign, preferably all three. This is a good game that could have been great, and I honestly lament that since I could really go for a solid co-op melee ARPG with a large playerbase."

Worth 15 euros at best.

Editing my review because the devs have patched some stuff. They patched some endgame stuff to be less tedious, which is a welcome change. Shame it took so long between the updates.

Story is maximum blandness, like a 12 year old boy wrote it for some school essay. In summary: ""Bad guy is bad because he betrayed you and he is also bad. It will be a tough fight, but you are good and you fight for the good of others so you will win."" I'd recommend getting a hang of the mechanics and then boosting up to the endgame.

Combat is really good, feels fluent and is pretty challenging. Endgame modes are decent EXCEPT for the spirit realm, that mode is extremely boring (a bit less boring solo now with the patch improvements, but still not great to solo). Valorplate shard issue has been patched, you can now exalt a plate easier!

There is quite some build variety if you look for it, sadly it seems like ailments + consume or longsword + weapon tech spam is always an easy win for every valorplate. Sometimes it seems the valorplate is just a skin. The shards alleviated that a bit, but it still feels like a minimal difference. Items are interesting though, and you can definitely build around some good items.

The lore is surprisingly good (from what I've heard), but it's all hidden in the codex and barely mentioned during the story.

Overall, it looks very good, but it boils down to a shiny game with very good combat, dragged down by a lack of character, empty feeling worlds and a mindless grind. Get it for the combat and the loot grind, otherwise it's probably not worth your time."

Ok, I just bought the game to write a review because I already completed it on EPICSTORE and I can t believe how many bad reviews this game has. Let s start by saying this is a gorgeous game. The first time I saw it reminded me to Destiny 2 medieval style with a mix of Diablo looter and Soulslike gameplay and... definitely it is all those. I bought it the next day and finished in a couple of weeks, then, when the expansions came I finished those as well. The old and new biomes are a spectacular work of art.

Now the loot and abilities system. It's flawless. Weapons are varied and skills activate new combos. You unlock new set of armors with their own abilities. Damn, this game is PACKED to the top.

Gamplay is dynamic, fast, strategic and non super punishing. I believe this is one of the things that some people might critisize if they are used to play games that have the phrase ""you are dead"" as a signature. This one has ""you are awesome"" and I love it. Bosses require a bit of planning and high level bosses my kill you a couple of times but with a little attention and a good coordination mouse / keyboard you can defeat all odds without feeling the game is a boring slug.

The story is ok... maybe the weakest point but it is the excuse to make it a solo adventure. I like how the game always centers you as the hero that is facing impossible odds and still triumphs. I don t know why people like unnecesary punishment in games but this is a breeze of fresh air. If you hate the punishment in soulslike games, here you are welcome to feel EPIC.

Overall this game is a 10 out of 10 for me. As I said I bought the game just to write a review as I cannot pass my progress from EPIC to STEAM but got hooked and played 48 minutes only to remember how much I like it and that I will probably play all over again in STEAM just to get the achievements as well.

Truth to be told I play only a couple of games in multiplayer and they were fine but not my cup of tea.

So don t pay much attention to the negatives. Try the game and have fun. This is one of the most intuitive hack and slash games I have play, it s beautiful, has tons of loots, lots of armors. Nothing can go wrong here. I have no clue if bad reviewers are using controller but is notizable this game was made for mouse and keyboard as it flows fantastically. Have nothing more to say but want to say more because this game truly deservers better.

Just have fun and enjoy the adventure!"

Bought for $20 in July 2022. The combat is excellent. The loot is plentiful and meaningful. The character building is solid.

After consulting the patch history, the game has been improved massively since released. The most recent major update, the Exalted Update published in April 2022, added even more unique build possibilities for each class (Valorplate) and another harder endgame activity.

If you enjoy this style of melee combat and character building, do yourself a favor and get this! I would say it's worth $40, but at $20 it's a great bargain."

visually stunning but combat feels jerky and kinda wrong like it wants to be a hack and slash but you have parry mechanics that sometimes just dont work and Im not talking about unparry-able attacks I mean i have literally had the parry flash go off and the opponent continue their combo leaving you to just get railed on

that said its not a bad game just the combat feels off, the games advertised as a melee looter shooter not a darksouls esq clone with worse combat even the twinblades the faster of the weapons feels sluggish

as it stands i can't recommend this game, but if I play more and start to enjoy it more and if I find out its just me being bad at the game and not understanding things then i'll change my review but as it stands the combat really does seem to let this combat orientated game down"

Had this game for free when I purchased a new GPU it was a promotional thing back when it was an Epic Store exclusive, loved the game back then even though it was literally weeks old and lacking a lot of the current content. Fast forward to today and I bought 2 copies of this game one for myself and the other for a friend, its still a great game and excellent value for what I paid per copy (£9). All the negative reviews I have seen are those who either have not completed the game and are just basing it on BS they assume is correct like gear means nothing and you dont make builds lol wait until end game and then say that, also someone said there was no 180 degree turn in the game lol Press 'X' on your keyboard and you'll do a 180 turn... So many ignorant reviews and blatant lies. This game is fun, very shiny, and visual eye candy with what I personally think is some really fun combat.

I recommend this game to anyone who likes a nice hack and slash game with a bit of loot thrown in for good measure."

This game is just garbage, it's full of bugs and feels like a cheap early access game.

You get stuck on geometry when colliding with enemies.
Enemies get stuck under the floor preventing you from completing a challenge.

Key inputs get eaten by the system or generate ghost inputs, inputs get buffered when you don't want to, and don't buffer when you actually want them to.
Kragani has retarded mechanics preventing him to die even though his health pool was 0, though sometimes it just dies out of nowhere or from a heavy attack and sometimes you need to kill it by blocking his perilous head smash which is just aggrevating at best.

Lightbringer is a meh game mode at best, decent challenge if you like these things.
Spirit realms is just boring and bland.
Unlocking everything is required to get your valorplate exalted though some challenges require you to do 10 mid bosses in spirit realms which can take about 30 minutes per run for 2 bosses if you play it right....

Decursing gear and augments was boring and aggrevating and some aren't even worth the hassle.

I've completed the ascended tower of trials which was really the most fun this game had to offer at best.
Exalted tower of trials is just borderline insane and requires a strong build with everything min maxed and preferably exalted valorplate, but getting exalted is just pure agony.
I cleared round 3 in the exalted tower but there's no tuning, you just get tossed around and gang banged, even the augment that should prevent getting interupted doesn't work against all the knockbacks the enemies do.
not to mention the fact that some enemies can lock you into place preventing movement or any attacks or defence / dodge for that matter, which leaves you open to all the attacks coming in at the same time.
it's not difficult, it's just broken mechanics tossed on top of eachother and calling it 'hard'.

the game mentions that you should bring some friends to clear it, personally i feel this should just scale to the amount of players entering the challenge, but that's just me.

after 172 hours, from which the last 40 hours i've spent grinding the first three levels of ascended tower i've decided to call it quits.

the game has actual potential but it's just a broken and bland game in it's current state.
the only reason i don't actually regret the purchase is that i've bought it for € 12,- , this game isn't worth more than € 15,- at best now."

If you want a game to let off some steam then this one is a very good choice.
I have to admit, i was skeptical about purchasing it because of the reviews i read about it and because of some friends' opinions about the game. Still, i took a chance and boy was i not disapponted, not much at least.

Gameplay wise you have a typical third person hack and slash game, similar to Devil May Cry, God of War, Warframe etc but with an added loot flair coming from Diablo. It has good, fast-pased melee oriented combat which is very easy to get the hang of, you get multiple weapons, each with its own playstyle and abilities, a shield (useable with every weapon) and a banner giving you aoe buffs. You get 12 Valorplates each with its own buffs and abilities and each complementing a certain playstyle and a skill tree, which was the biggest surprise for me, which you can reset anytime you want for mfree unlimited times. This means you can test an unlimited amount of valorplate-gear-skill combos with the click of a button!

The game is supported by very nice graphics, the environments look gorgeous and distinctive from each other and even at low settings it is still very beautiful to look at.

My biggest letdown with the game was the story. It seems to have an interesting story to tell but it omits the usual story exposition during gameplay and wants you to go and read the Codex in order to get a glimpse of the story and the characters. That makes it very hard to bond with them and look at the game as a true Action-Rpg rather than a simple Hack and Slash with bits and pieces of story sprinkled over it. I wish it was better in this end.

Ultimately, Godfall does deliver on some fronts but fails on others. Personally, i didn't buy it for the story but for the gameplay and to have some fun with some friends. So, if you want to just mindlessly slash your way through enemies, blow some steam and have some fun with friends then go for it, albeit at a discount. I can not excuse paying premium for this game. If you want a story-rich adventure similar ot Devil May Cry or God of War then you should look elsewere because unfortunately this game fails to deliver.

If i were to rate Godfall, i'd give it a 6.5/10. A good game with some great ideas that could be a lot better but is still fun to play."

I played a lot of this game and I would be cautious about who I would recommend this to. Ultimately it's not a bad game and does satisfies a certain craving -- kind of like how a tablespoon of sugar satiates a craving for cake. It's not new, innovated or particularly exciting, but the gameplay loop is entertaining enough for the completionists who want to ""collect them all"", or the folks who want to push further and further for personal bests. At the end of the grind and all the hours spent you won't be better off, and although the experience wasn't gruelling, there was no net gain.

There's a decent frame here in which to expand of course! Adding a shard system which makes Valorplates different was a start but also wasn't enough to really kick it up a notch. The combat system goes from brilliance to mediocre to downright unforgiving. You will suffer knockback loops and be faced with challenges that might seem unfair, but get a few pieces of gear or augments and you can quickly trivialize most content. There really isn't a good middle ground; you just get tossed and tussled until you get better items and then you're the one doing the tossing and tusseling. The endgame essentially boils down to running the same content over and over hoping for a slightrly better drop with stats that bumps you up by a couple of percents so you can run the same content at a slightly faster pace. If you're into ""GRift"" running in Diablo 3 for personal bests you might enjoy Godfall, however mind that while a Greater Rift takes minutes, Tower Runs can take an hour or two. Godfall Fatigue is real.

Anyway, it's hard to pick thumbs up or thumbs down mostly because Godfall exists in the very middle between ""just okay"" and ""decent"". Because it managed to hook me for over a hundred hours I'll give it a thumbs up, but I'm also easily entertained. Going back to my original point, this would be a hard game to recommend to just anyone."

Sluggish combat. Annoying enemies. Classic generic Unreal-engine overuse of bloom & post-processing effects that leave the screen a mess of blurry grease. Oh and the story? It might as well not exist. Just a complete miss. I guess I should have known better from the fact it was an Epic exclusive. That usually means the developer knows they're not going to succeed in the open market."

Lot of people said, that the game suck but for me this game is not that bad at all. Nice story, gameplay, graphics. Lot of variations of weapons and fighting styles with combos. If you dont know what to play, try this one out."

It's pretty fun hack and slash grind if you can ignore the generic story and very very basic script. Honestly, I felt stupid listening to it.
Game is extremely repetitive, but I have fun because the combat gets progressively more complex and it's great to mush buttons to de-stress on normal with unlimited lives.
That is until you reach 50 where it goes to Time attack, Time attack, Time attack . . . ♥♥♥♥♥ annoying . . . I want to mash buttons and methodically dismantle my enemies. Not here, the timer keeps screaming at you non stop. All end game modes are ♥♥♥♥♥ timed . . ."

I don't get the negative reviews. The combat feels great, the bosses are challenging, the weapon variation is solid and the leveling system is very good. Lots of stuff to do when finishing the story including a lot of different ways to setup a build.

I can only complain about having to abandon a mission 1 time from getting stuck and not having some sort of minimap but it's minor stuff that doesn't matter in the long run."

The gameplay is pretty fun if you just want a hack and slash looter. The core issue is that you'll have 30 second long fights every 5 minutes if you actually play the game the way it was intended. You'll spend 30 minutes running around a big, empty map with maybe 20 total enemies throughout it, and that's it. That's the game.

It's just boring. Even if the combat were 200% better than it is, the game would still just be bland because of how little combat there actually is."

Dull.
It's too bad, I know that if I played this a decade ago it would've been incredible, something akin to Darksiders for my younger self, but after the years of seeing game after game already do this, it's just so bland that there's nothing here to hold your interest.

If you're new to gaming, or this genre of gaming, this is a great starter experience for you. If not, then save yourself the trouble and move on, nothing interesting to do here."

Does exactly what it says on the tin.
My sole gripe is the camera when trying to fight several enemies at once. I'm just starting to get used to it, but it'd be nice to have more options."

I really want to like this game but this is more like a stunlock simulator than a game. I don't really care about the story, I play the game for the combat and loot but the combat just feel clunky sometime."

I really tried to like this game. Game is sometimes too dark, sometimes too bright. Combat is awkward to get used to. Sorry for the bad review. I don't want to sink hundreds of hours into this game. Not worth it."

It would be much better if you could save during missions so that when the game crashes (which seems to be often), you aren't reset to the beginning of the mission. The artwork is beautiful though and I like being able to switch between valorplates."

Graphics is nice ... combat is just so so and not really satisfying. Weapons and items makes the game interesting however, the issue is with the combat system. Most of the boss fights are stressful and the block/parry system is murky and not intuitive. Maybe people who enjoys endless dying experience like dark souls series might be okay with this game. For others who wants to enjoy a fun action game... look elsewhere."

Keyboard controls are horrendous in this game, and my DS4 controller (which works in every other steam game advertised with full controller support) doesn't work in this game. Game forces you to always be online even if you play single-player, and was an epic exclusive."

Graphics are very good but the gameplay is very mediocre. For a game being so focussed on being fast paced the combat can feel a bit sluggish. Also enemy attacks can be unclear making them annoying to block/dodge. Then there is just silly stuff like in the first major boss is so big that it is not possible to see the attacks she is making."
