This game got me through a really dark place in my life. I lost my job, spouse, and home in less than a year. I would chop wood and fish when I couldn't find the energy to do anything else and fall asleep on the couch listening to the background music. I've put thousands of hours into Stardew Valley. The little successes I had were the catalyst I needed to think maybe I could have little successes again in life, too. Highly recommend. Thank you for making this game."

Ok so far from my game this is what I got:
> farming for first week
> mayor tells me to socialize with the townfolk
> decide to talk to random people
> lots of talking
> finally think i met everyone
> try to interact with trashcan
> find a salad in trash, untouched
> girl sees me digging in trash
> girl gets grossed out from me digging in the trash
> get mad, decide to follow her
> catch her walking towards lake
> turns out shes pretty
> want to know how to marry her
> find out that i can gift people
> dont know what to gift
> remembered i had salad from the trash that she saw me grab
> give salad to her
> she loves it
> advance a year or two later
> me and girl are married

Is this how true love works?

One thing I never realized until I finished the game is that you shouldn't rush it. I got everything done 8 years in game, found all the secrets, got 100% completionist on the tracker, found all the secret cutscenes, collected every hats, accessories, rings and weapons that are available in the game and have completed all endgame content. But when the credit starts rolling, all I feel is emptiness and a void that I can no longer fill up. This is a wonderful game that's just so inviting and calming to play, whether it is by myself or with a friend and now it is all over.

If you have got the time to spare, take my advice and enjoy the slow ride. Don't rush it and try to get everything with a guide early on, because all there is at the end is the credits."

I remember buying this game for my brother a few years back. Didn't think much of it at the time, but I thought it would be a nice gift for him. I remember seeing him playing it from time to time, the message indicating that he'd started playing it popping up on the corner of my screen. There was always a certain small pride in seeing that, because to me it meant that he was enjoying my gift.
Last September he committed suicide.
After everything had more or less settled down from that, I sat down and booted up his computer. All that was on there was Chrome, Steam, Word, and a few games. One of them, of course, was Stardew Valley.
He had played this game to pieces, clocking over 170 hours and owning practically everything the game had to offer. He had used every square inch to its maximum potential, and was making ridiculous amounts of cash. It was only then did I see just how much he loved his present. No other game he played quite captured his affection as much as this one. None of his friends really knew about it, however; it seems like he preferred to keep it to himself. Like it was his own little bit of heaven he could turn to whenever he wanted.

And because of that, I can't help but smile whenever I play this game.

I cannot recommend it enough; every bit of hard work the developer put into this masterpiece shows in every single aspect. The music is catchy and memorable (i'll ofetn find myself humming certain tunes from it), the world feels lived-in and natural, and the gameplay is incredibly laid back and enjoyable. It's hard to stop once I get invested in the game; minutes can easily turn into several hours. And now, with the multiplayer beta, I play for even longer with my friends, each of us dedicated to our desired jobs. Most of all, however, we're all just happy to be together."

I grew up playing Harvest Moon with my mom and it is one of my fondest memories. She would always buy me the new one for Christmas, and we would play it all day, filling notebooks full of recipes and discussing which person we hoped to marry. Although Stardew Valley has unmistakable similarities to Harvest Moon, it is a masterpiece in it's own right, one that is very dear to my heart after all those years playing with my mum.

Stardew Valley is complex and simple, heartwarming and detailed. It's complicated enough that so many hours later I still haven't completed most of the achievements or befriended most of the townsfolk, but it's simple and easy enough that I play it almost every night on the couch after work.

Concerned Ape has programmed a masterpiece; his story is just as heartwarming as the story he created. I anticipate each new release and I can't wait to see how far he takes this wonderful game. I rarely give games a perfect score, but this certainly deserves a ten out of ten."

Thank you.
I really hope the developers are able to find this review somehow.

We all have difficult times in our lives.

I started playing Stardew Valley in April 2021, which was not an easy moment in my life. Apart from the COVID pandemic, i was struggling with high anxiety/depression, college was online and the pressure, both from the university and myself, never stopped. It was hard. I cried a lot. But somehow i got through this.
I never played this kind of game before, sort of ""Harvest Moon""-like i guess. But i wanted to try something that i could just... Relax. Enjoy. Take a deep breath and calm my mind. Relieve the tension. Chill.

Stardew Valley, for me, was kind of... a life saver.
I'm still playing it (100h and counting) and the game still do what it did in the beginning: it's an incredibly charming and relaxing game, it's fun and it has likable characters, so far it has been an experience that i am very happy i gave it a shot.
It's one of my favorite indie games ever now. Right beside Bastion, Hollow Knight and Shovel Knight, other favorites of mine.

Stardew Valley calmed me when i needed most. And i will not forget that.

There isn't much to be said that hasn't already been said for this amazing game if you enjoyed the classic harvest moon type games you will absolutely 100% enjoy this. The game play seems fresh and fun even after clocking in over 60 hours, You won't want to quit, “Just 1 more day” then you realize that turned into 5 days and it's 4am and you have to sleep sometime.

This game, takes the old harvest moon concepts and tosses in a bit of Rune factory and a sprinkle of animal crossing leaving you with a sensational experience. Each day brings something fresh, There is over 25 different Npc's to interact with each day and each one brings their own charm and dialogue options depending on if you take the time to build up your friendships.

Your farm can be whatever you make it, You design what it looks like, how it runs, what you plant and what animals you choose to raise. The fishing can be a bit difficult to begin with but very rewarding and relaxing once you get the hang of it. On days you want something a bit different you can hop into the mine and find some rare gems, ores and minerals, Some that you can donate to the game's huge museum or use to upgrade your tools!

I can't praise this game enough, if your on the fence about purchasing this game or you think you should wait for a sale, Don't wait! This game was made by a single developer who deserves every single penny for all the obvious hard work and dedication. So go and farm your butt off!!!"

If you're looking for a wholesome game that destroys your IRL health bar, look no further. The regularly satisfying hits of dopamine will cause addiction. You'll lose sleep due to the ""Just one more day"" factor. You'll strain your eyes. Your most visited website will change. The existential crisis that will awaken in you for enjoying a pixelated, 2-D world more than your reality will send you down a path of reflection and, in most cases, enlightenment. Probably."

This is a game that I have been looking forward to for at least 2 and a half years. I have wanted to have a game on the PC that had the elements of harvest moon (for the little bit I played of it), Animal crossing (<3) and Rune factory. I was super excited when I was approached by Leth (publishing manager at Chucklefish) at the beginning of December to help him and ConcernedApe (developer of the game) with bug testing and QA. 400+ hours later (off steam and on steam), I still love the game.

Farming. The farming is fantastic. It is to me one of the main elements of the game, and it's just a joy. Being able to design your farm any way you want it... yes please. Planning out what to buy every season, where to plant them, on top of the thrill of when you can harvest and reap on the gold... it's so enjoyable and addictive.

Fishing. The fishing is outstanding. From playing WoW and Runescape.. or any game with fishing, the fishing in Stardew Valley is so much fun. At first, the fishing is challenging, but as you progress your skill, you become a pro in no time.

Mining and combat. Mining and combat is incredible. Going deeper into the mines can be tough, but if you're prepared with your food and weapon in hand, you can fend off the creatures and get your sweet ore/minerals/gems that you want to bring back to your house and possibly hoard. (Hi, I'm Bexy, and i'm a hoarder.)

Social. Social interactions are great. Being able to become friends with the people in the town, and eventually being able to get into relationships with people and having a family with them.. what's not to like about that? And what's great is that it gives great replayability because you can have different saves with different spouses! The backstory for each of the characters too is so in depth and well thought out, you will be silly if you don't shed a tear maybe once or twice.

The actual main story is well rewarding, and once you ""complete"" it, you can still continue on your adventures and farming life with no problems, hell you might even discover new things afterwards, I sure as hell did!

Yes, I was a tester for the game. Yes, I have played for ridiculous amounts of hours. It may feel like i'm being a bit overzealous with this. However you have to remember, I was a tester. I tested the crap out of every aspect with this game, even though there were massive game breaking bugs, errors, glitches, crashes. I still love this game. I reported many a bug, and ConcernedApe was quick to fix them.

And that's the thing, not only is the game amazing, the developer is too. ConcernedApe works around the clock to make sure that bugs are fixed in quick time in order for us to have an amazing experience with this game. And that's true. The experience that you have with this game IS amazing.

Minutes playing turn into hours. Hours turn into ""oh no it's time to sleep"".
You will forget about time. You will forget about sleep. You will forget that dinner was about 5 hours ago but you couldn't' remember because you were too busy trying to fight off 12 bats that were clobbering you inside the mines while trying to gather that 1 diamond waaaaay in the back.

So yes, I without a shadow of a doubt 150% recommend this game to anyone that wants to ""escape"" for days on end with what I am classifying as my #1 Game of 2016."

relaxation at it's finest
a quiet life on the farm
baby animals bring smiles
a lovely garden adds some charm

if adventure is your thing
there are monsters in the mine
or travel to a far off land
either one is totally fine

for those who feel more social
the town is chatty and populated
pick up a cutie at the saloon
maybe a wedding will be fated

If you look at the playtime above this review, you might be thinking to yourself... ""How on earth does one person invest 400 hours of their life into a game about farming?"" Well, it's a lot easier than you think.

Stardew Valley opens with our disillusioned protagonist slaving away at a corporate job, only to be reminded of a promise that they had made with their grandfather so many years ago. A promise of something to brighten the shadows when life becomes too dreary for them. Our stalwart protagonist waves goodbye to the grey walls of their office to board a train to Stardew Valley, an unknown paradise far away from the city. And it is here, where their life truly begins.

I can only wish that we all find our Stardew Valley someday. Yee-haw."

I convinced my brother to help me buy our mom a PS4 last Christmas so she could play Stardew Valley. She was playing the same Animal Crossing game on Wii for years, so getting her to try something new was risky.

After my brother showed her the TV apps, mom humored me and let me teach her how to play. She made a farm, and sort of caught on to using tools.

It’s August now. She’s logged over 500 hours into that farm. Her cellar is packed with kegs, the seashore is red with crab pots. She wields a flashy Return Scepter that I’ve never even gotten.

INTRODUCTION

Stardew Valley.

I've heard a lot of things about this game. A lot of extremely positive things.

And I was doubtful. Was Stardew Valley really that good? I was afraid that people were just giving it attention because they didn't actually know what a good game was. And as insulting as it may sound, in my defense, uhhm....

Before buying the game I hadn't really seen what it looked like, or knew what it was about. I just knew that it was published by the same company, Chucklefish, that had developed Starbound. I had loved Starbound.. So I was playing completely spoiler free. Haven't watched any videos, no tips & tricks, just the information of a billion recommended reviews stuffed into my head.

So I bought Stardew Valley, and had pretty high expectations. If a game received THAT much popularity, it should be seriously good, right?



Plop. Into the world of Stardew Valley.

You completely start from the bottom, trailing after a tragedy and responsibility that's struck. A farm, barely any money, and the mystery of a town left in your hands. Whew. That's really a lot when you think about it.


Boy, did I NOT know what I was getting myself into.


At first, I was mesmorized. Or maybe lost is a better word. The beginning's all new and immersive, and the middle... kind of leaves you stuck. But, this is because I was impatient with the game. I went in wanting to finish it asap. However, I realized this game is NOT simply for you to buy and finish. It's something else... entirely.

The thing with Stardew Valley, It's all about exploration and management. Discovering and figuring out secrets and a beautiful story was amazing. Creative mechanics and powerful creativity had combined to produce a fabulous well-formed game that leaves a sweet taste in your mouth, and I'm going to tell you right now... it's totally addicting.

I bought the game a few days ago, and literally have played it all day since. I've NEVER done that with a game before. I found myself as a kid in a candy shop, gaping at all the different flavors, and being able to savor them all. And now, in Year 3 of the game.. I still have a lot more to discover.



Compared to others, I've only played around 130 hours of the game thus far. Buy Stardew Valley. You really won't regret it. This game is beautiful. The music is whimsically lifting, and the soundtrack is wonderful. It's a work of art. You will find yourself falling in love with the characters, and the daily routine of being a farmer who restores the life around people, and who changes everyone for the better. It's so relaxing, so addicting, and so much fun. I have played games for years, played games with far more hours than I have with Stardew Valley- and yet, I always turn to Stardew Valley first. Why? It's amazing. It offers something to everyone.

The game rewards for the hard-working. Stardew Valley is a game where you really have to manage things, yet, it allows you to explore the whole art of it. Work hard as you play the game, and there are sweet rewards. And I'm talking about rewards sweeter than all the candy in that candy shop.

Here's the thing: you can take two routes with Stardew Valley. You can either take the money route and become rich and miss half the game, or you can immerse yourself in exploring the town and what the game has to offer, but with also missing the point that Stardew is a management farming game.

Or, you can successfully find the balance between both. But how?

Stardew Valley allows you to store multiple accounts, which is fantastic. I recommend exploring with your first account, and learning the ropes. You seriously won't know anything yet, and will be like ""OMFG"" when you figure out there's a way that makes things one hundred times easier. After that, create a second account, and start figuring out farm management and what the game has to offer. This is a game in which you learn from your mistakes.

And now... I'm left in a spot where I can successfully thrive, and only continue to grow.



- Enchanting music that sings as you play

- A simple yet fun art design that you can't help but fall in love with

- Characters whom capture your heart

- A shambled town that begins to thrive

- Hidden secrets that you can't help but want to keep discovering

- Amazing challenges that leave you wanting more

- Brilliant originality, which is incredibly difficult to find

- A storyline that changes your perspective beautifully

- Lots of fun, and I mean .

- Mods created by the community to make your game more fun and immersive- however, I play without mods.

- IT FINALLY HAS MULTIPLAYER!



- As I said, the game rewards you for hard work. But only for hard work. It can be a grueling process, but it is extremely profitable. Those who don't like putting effort into a game won't enjoy Stardew Valley as much as other games.

- Time. Stardew Valley takes a lot of time to play through. It's a game you thoroughly have to enjoy and adventure out on.

- Repetitive. The game can be grueling. To reach certain goals you have to go through processes that you will SERIOUSLY hate. But, in the end, it's definitely worth the labor.




- I wish there would be more characters. Once you go through the storyline with everyone, there's not much lore left.

- More secrets and new areas, of course!



Stardew Valley offers a lot of things, and has changed the lives of many people. Perhaps in peace, wonder, open-mindedness, the game gives a lot. But I have one thing that's been bothering me for a long time... How in the damn world did one single person spit out a freaking awesome game?

Even though it's a farming game, which is commonly found everywhere, it's original with its own spins. It's extremely difficult to find a game that has such a captivating message that's been developed so well. Stardew Valley is a lot of fun and awe, and it really draws a blank in your mind.

Buy Stardew Valley. At first, it might seem mediocre... but keep playing. Trust me, the candies are still sweet. And they really only get sweeter."

Spoiler free review, with a short and a longer version:

Buy this game if:

+ You're interested in farming, even though you're allowed to make that it isn't 100% of the core gameplay;
+ You were looking for a long, yet various and easy to be resumed game;
+ You're fond of pixelated indie games;
+ You can bear resource hunting and you have some patience, as there are some RPG and crafting gameplay;
+ You love games that are supported by modders and regularly updayed by the developer himself (Update 1.5 - see longer review part down below)

Don't buy the game if those above points aren't significant for you;






Longer version:
Let's see now the most important points, including the DLC, described in the 6th bullet point:

1-
Your grandpa, who lived the last part of his life is Stardew Valley has passed away and you as his nephew/niece have inherited a plot of land in Stardew Valley itself. Bored and saddened by the repetitive and dull life that you're spending working in a big firm (feel free to imagine it as Amazon/Nestlè)... you decide to accept the inheritance and embark in this new life and adventure.

2-
Even though clearing debris, pruning weeds, killing evil monsters and cutting trees is fun and necessary up to a certain point, you're not ""forced"" to keep farming 24/7, as the game is full of side activities who can be remunerative and of course fun, such as:
- tending to animals;
- mining;
- foraging;
- fishing:
- more...

3-
this means that besides customizing your own home, buildings and clothes there is a skill system, which can shape and improve the way on how you've decided to play the game;

4-
The NPCs are actually interesting and they're worth your time, socializing with them, helping them and confronting them on events, quests is always a good distraction and worth your time, as they'll be quite rewarding in terms of money, items and story progression in general, even though you're not forced to follow any particular path. Your actions have consequences that will also change the landscape and the city.

5-
I personally recommend Stardew Valley Expanded as a mod to be installed, feel free to check it on Nexusmods

6-
my biggest gripe with SV this free massive update from December 2020 was that there wasn't enough end-gameplay elements or goals to be reached. This update addressed completely these issues by adding a new whole area, distant from Stardew Valley, by adding new minerals, animals, crops, quests, weekly quests, npcs and much more, including many quality of life changes, which make the gameplay much smoother and fluid.

I spent three years building up hype, and I was still blown away.

If you enjoyed Harvest Moon, Rune Factory or Animal Crossing - then get this. It captures all the same things that made those games great, and it's the perfect game to play either casually or seriously. There are so many different ways to earn money and they're all developed and fun, the hardest part is choosing which one to spend your time doing.

The progression curve in the game is fantastic too. Every day you'll feel like you're making progress but there's still always something to work towards and you won't 'beat it' after a couple of hours earning as much money as possible, as there's always something to spend your money on. Even after 20 hours of playing, I feel like I'm nowhere near the endgame, and I could easily see myself playing through again and doing things differently. I'm even doing a playthrough on YouTube and the progress feels dramatically different even in its early stages.

I'm easily disappointed by games, so you can imagine my surprise when I was so impressed by a game made by one person. Congratulations, ConcernedApe, you've made one of the best games I've ever played."

Overview

Stardew Valley is a game that borrows heavily from similar titles in the Harvest Moon series. You start out in a rural town with nothing but a dilapidated house and crop fields that are more akin to the wilderness than a place to grow vegetables. The game is simple in its understanding: build a farm, make profits, live your life. What the game allows you to do makes it so much more layered. You're left with the freedom to explore the town, its residence, mold your farm into whatever you want it to be and on your own time. Sure, there are events to attend, festivals to see, men/women to romance and marry, kids to have, buildings to construct, fish to catch and weird little slimes to slay (Dragon Warrior, anyone?), but how and when you do those things is up to you.

In essence, the game offers you very similar things to do as a Harvest Moon game does: Build and upgrade your farm, plant crops, upgrade tools, mine in the never-ending dungeon for precious ore, go fishing, romance and get married...etc. While some of your old favorites are back, new aspects have been introduced as well, but I won't spoil those in this review. Let's just say there's a nice story that evolves over time.

The freedom to do as you please is what makes this game, and Harvest Moon in general, so enjoyable. It's a chance to mellow out, play at your own pace and still enjoy everything the game has to offer. What Stardew Valley does, it does right. It's charming, cute and feels rewarding, even when all you're doing is cuttings weeds. It doesn't pull any punches or try to be something its not; the developer had a goal in mind and Stardew Valley is a reflection of just that. You can feel the effort, the time and the devotion that went into this game over the years. Stardew Valley is a gem and worth looking at. If you loved Harvest Moon, you'll love Stardew Valley.

To date, Stardew Valley is a single player game, though the developer as mentioned some form of co-op or multiplayer availability in the future.











Overall, Stardew Valley is a pleasure. I haven't put a ton of time into it (yet), but I easily see that happening. It's fun, lighthearted and addictive. As I said earlier in this review, if you've ever played Harvest Moon, you'll enjoy Stardew Valley. It's worth checking out and I highly recommend it. This will easily become one of my most played games on my list. You won't be disappointed, so check it out!"

I was never interested in farming games. I’ve never played a Harvest Moon game or an Animal Crossing game, and never had any interest in them. The closest thing to a farming game I’ve ever played was Minecraft. I definitely would have never tried Stardew Valley if I wasn’t an achievement hunter and it didn’t have achievements.

But now I see what all the hype was about.

Stardew Valley is a game that is very easy to lose oneself into. There are many elements of the game that feel intimately relatable to real life, especially the game’s premise: you’re stuck at a soul-crushing corporate office job when your grandfather dies, leaving you an envelope telling you to open it only when you’ve reached your absolute limit and need something new. After a particularly bad day at work, you finally decide to open the envelope and find a deed to your grandfather’s farm on a far-off island, so you take the plunge and decide to move there. It is a very strong analogy to the game itself, where you, the player, are seeking escapism from your daily life and decide to take the plunge into this game, not knowing what else to expect.

In Stardew Valley, you will find your new home upon a sizable but absolutely trashed plot of land. As the days go by, you can clean up the land and discover hundreds of ways to make a profit with what you’ve been given, from buying seeds and planting crops, to raising animals, to fishing (by means of a surprisingly pleasant and addictive quicktime event), to foraging for wild food, and even to exploring a few combat-centric Zelda-style dungeons. But you’re not making money for its own sake – there are dozens of mysterious secrets scattered about the land, each with significant and game-changing rewards at the end, and you need to raise the money and resources to investigate them all. The game experience is going to be totally different for everybody depending on what game elements you are inspired to pursue first. Although you’ll assuredly be looking at a wiki in due time, it is deeply satisfying to go in blind and piece things together yourself for as long as you can.

Years consist of four months, each month being 28-day season. Some gameplay mechanics change with the seasons, particularly that certain crops only grow in certain seasons, and (almost) no crops grow in winter, so you’ll have to carefully consider what seeds to plant and when. Each day lasts about five minutes, and you’ve got to make sure you’re back in your house by 2AM, or else you’ll pass out and lose some money. The biggest way the game hooks you is the fact that your progress is only saved at the of a day – so if you’re eager to wake up in the morning and harvest your crops, it won’t mean anything unless you play the whole day through. A vicious cycle! I clocked 120 hours of this game in the first 2 weeks of playing. That’s how bad it is.

Another one of the game’s strengths is the cozy little community you live beside, with a population of about 25 people. The game does a wonderful job of making each character feel like their own entity, with their own daily routines and backstories and motivations. You’ll really get to know and love them. You can give gifts to characters to increase friendship level with them, unlocking character development cutscenes and important rewards. You can even date some of them (you can have 6 boyfriends and 6 girlfriends at once if you want, no joke; relationships are gender-indiscriminate) and then marry the character of your choice. The social aspect is sometimes a bit too real – you’ll feel the pain of rejection all too often – but that makes the successful relationships all the more heartwarming.

As for complaints: surprisingly, the game has some strange and baffling bugs, most of which are visual (like ice-skating horses), but some which affect gameplay, and a few known save-corruption bugs. I also felt consistently uncomfortable with the controls. If you're using the mouse, your cursor needs to always be in proximity of your character, or else you'll only aim at the tile in front of you, making it very easy to abruptly turn the wrong direction while working. And if you accidentally click the wrong tile, your character will turn to face it, changing the default direction you aim, compounding the problem. It can be infuriating, especially if it causes you to accidentally destroy crops. Also, I don't like how you can only talk to NPCs if you have a tool selected, and how you'll use a consumable item at the same time as opening a door if you have one selected. The controls could definitely use some additional polish.

Then there are the inventory controls. If you click on an inventory item, you pick it up and you can drop it in a different inventory slot. If you click on an inventory item with a storage box open, you will immediately transfer the item into (or out of) the box. Thus, it is impossible to organize the inventory with a storage box open. If you click on an inventory item while in a shop, . I can't tell you the amount of times I purchased 200 seeds, then immediately sold them again just because I tried to pick them up and put them in a different slot.

Also, I can’t help but feel the game should have even more content than it already does – perhaps more dungeons, a bigger map, and the ability to run more than one farm. But (as of this writing) the game is still in active development, including a co-op multiplayer patch in the works, and a lively modding community.

I give this game an 8/10. A wonderful example of what all those crappy Farmville mobile games would be like if they were actually balanced around gameplay and not milking the player with microtansactions and daily login bonuses. Despite some stupidly distracting bugs and annoying controls, it’s some simply wonderful escapism, and made me finally see the appeal in a farming game. It does get stale in time, but not before offering a huge amount of joy. For achievement hunting, it’ll easily take about 200 hours, especially blind… but if you’re like me, you’ll have it over with in a month or two. A huge thumbs-up."

Originally, when I was younger and inconsiderate, I pirated this game and sunk in at least 100 hours. Once I had my own money, I bought this game on Steam when the multiplayer update came out. I played a lot with my girlfriend at the time, and when we broke up, I stopped playing for a while and deleted the save. A few months later I was in a low place, so I bought this game on Switch and completed the story and got married, and had kids (so I sunk in a fair amount of hours ~200) It was the only thing motivating me to look after myself as I wanted to keep playing. As I recovered from that dark part of my life, I played less and less until a friend mentioned they wanted to play with me. So now I've been chilling on a farm with my friend through lockdown. This game as a whole has helped me through a lot, and has given me a bunch of great memories. I recommend Stardew Valley to anyone that likes Harvest Moon, farming sims in general, or just having a great time. The music is stellar and the art style is nice and fits with the game. Generally a great experience!!"

Stardew Valley is literally the first game that I bought in seconds, with the full price, without thinking. I was a Harvest Moon lover, I really, really wanted to have a PC game like HM, and Oh my.
ConcernedApe, you sir, are one of the most amazing developers, both in terms of actual developing, and keeping up with the date as well. There are a lot of games out there that were abondened by their devs, but our supreme leader listens. Makes it happen. And I am oh so greatful.
The story, the characters, the customization, mods that you can get, amount of things you can do in this games is just amazing, also, it is, IT REALLY IS, Beautiful~ You can see in the wiki, how the NPC development went, you can feel the time this game was given by this person, and he deserves every single penny and every single praise for it.

I've picked up this game several times and it didn't click in the way I thought it would. I got too caught up in the ""I must do everything every day"" mentality which, like in real life, doesn't work out very well.

Once I learned that there's no time limit in terms of ""years"" (you can play infinitely) I was able to settle into a relaxed ""I'll worry about that next year"" mentality and now can't stop playing."

I grew up playing Harvest Moon on the SNES. My parents probably rented the game a dozen+ times before putting up the money to just buy the damn game. My brother and I dumped hours, and hours, and hours into that game. Beating it multiple times to see some of the different endings.


A few years ago, for the first time, a game was released that bested the original Harvest Moon. That game is obviously Fortnite. JK


Stardew Valley is such a good spiritual successor, that it beats the original hand over fist. It's entirely it's own game, while nodding its head to what I assume is its source inspiration. It exceeded my expectations by a lot, and it continues to be improved on again and again. FOR FREE


This game has a lot of replayability (just ask my wife who has nearly 1000 hours logged by now). Between different relationships, different focuses, different game altering choices, and different property layouts and designs. There's enough content to keep you entertained and coming back for a very long time.


It might seem minor, but the games soundtrack is probably one of the best, if not THE best out there. Chrono Cross was my former favorite, but only Stardew Valley has led to me purchasing the soundtrack on digital and two different vinyl releases (okay, one of those was a gift). It keeps the game from getting as monotonous as it MIGHT otherwise get sometimes. Its similar to the Tetris song. After enough playing, the music is ingrained in my soul. Lmao


Gorgeous pixel graphics. Amazing variety and loads of charm. The creator clearly has a deep passion for this game and it shows in nearly every way.


This game deserves so much more money and appreciation than it gets.


11/10 - stop ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ around and buy the game already. I dont care if you find farming boring.

PS - shout out to my brother. He never got to experience this masterpiece, but at least we had good times on Harvest Moon. He would have loved it. RIP 1987-2007"

This game is dangerous.

When I first started playing I was like, ""It's cool, farming is fun but I don't really see the hype around it.""

Then I kept playing.

It's gotten so bad that I have 10 tabs open just to look up stuff on the wiki for this game. I open the game and blink and two hours have passed, and while I feel sad that I just lost so much time, I look at the progress I made on my farm and think, ""Worth.""

This is one of the most fun games I've ever played.

It's designed in such a way that it allows both casual players and competitive / optimization-oriented players to have a blast with this game. There is so much to do in this game, and there's so much to offer. You can spend your days farming, fishing, mining, foraging, talking to the villagers, etc. The game is made in a way in which you don't have to hyper-optimize every little detail like min-maxing profit, time management, etc, because there's no time limit for things (unless you count seasons, but there's always another year) and there's no stakes. But if you want to, you definitely can.

Talking to the villagers is fun as well, they're well-designed, and you can even find patterns in their daily schedules. There's a lot of details in this game.

I haven't tried the multiplayer, but from what I've seen it can definitely be a lot more fun with friends. But playing solo is extremely fun as well.

My only gripe with the game is that it's a huge time sink. I waited until my semester was over to get into it because I heard about the time sink beforehand, and I was glad I waited, because all I can think about now is, ""What crops am I going to plant next season? Where I should place them? How much money am I making from these? Should I fish or mine? Did I feed my animals today? DID I TALK TO ROBIN TODAY?""

And of course, Robin is best girl, no discussion there."

There are plenty of games out there that might give you a higher high. Getting the highest score in a lobby of some FPS for example.

There are plenty of games that will give you a lower low. Seeing your companion die in some RPG for example.

This game is nothing short of straight BEAUTY. I have never played a farming sim before this, and honestly I thought I wouldn't like it because it was so different from the games I usually played at the time (FPS). As soon as I cracked it open, I felt the joy of 100 perfect headshots of a PvP match light up my cerebral cortex as my brain was melted by the gracious and time-taking beauty of Stardew Valley. The amazing 16-bit design of the character portraits, freshly tilled ground, and don't get me started on the fishing. Without any guides, I made 15,000 Gold before Winter, and even with watching guides, you never feel like you're cheating yourself, because there's just so much joy to it that it is impossible to ruin the game with watching videos about (spoiler) and (spoiler). I was amazed to learn that this was created by ONE GUY, Mr. Eric Barone. May whatever God he believe in bless his soul, as he has blessed mine with this amazing game.

This is the game-equivalent to a long-time best friend for introverts:

You may have some questions at first, may have doubts, but the more time you spend with it, the more you attach yourself, the more it becomes a part of you and part of the things you cherish. It's the game you always come back to; the game that helps you relax when you get anxious; the game that is there with open arms when you are ready.

Do yourself a favor: get this game. Just trust me."

As you can see from my hours played I adore this game.

Whenever I search for a new game I go to the reviews and I make sure that the majority of the reviewers have played for more than 100 hours. Amount of hours played gives a game credibility in my opinion.

I have played and played and played Stardew Valley in many ways.

I have tried all of the maps, explored every inch, and grew to know every character.

Tonight my hubby and I are delving into the multiplayer beta and I still feel thrilled as if it was my first time playing.

The music is relaxing, the atmosphere is enjoyable, really everything about this game is made for one such as me.
I have a four year old and at night after bedtime I hop on my computer to calm down after the day. I nearly always go for Stardew Valley to really destress. (Though recently I have been attached to My Time at Portia lol), but still I come back to Stardew.

Every new time I play I try to knock out another steam challenge or two.

I try to woo new characters.

I try to keep it fresh.

And, thus far I still love this game as much as I did the first time I opened it."

By admission of the dev himself, this game is Harvest Moon at its core. A formula that is purely addictive and satisfying as hell.

But there is something Stardew Valley has over Harvest Moon, and that's a heart. The intro to the game is incredibly human and relatable. I sympathized with my character right off the bat. I think we all know how it feels to want to escape the mundane grind, and in a funny kind of way, this game does that.

A moment I felt that the game truly had a soul was when I was walking to the mines on a rainy day, when suddenly I was greeted by a cutscene of coming upon Abigail, my romance interest, playing a flute next to the lake. It's a very quiet scene, with nothing but the sound of rain and her flute playing. After some dialog, my character (who is a silent protagonist by the way) pulls out a mini harp and joins Abby in a duet, something that really surprised me as there was no indication that my character had any musical talent prior to this scene. It was a bonding experience, and it felt incredibly real, memorable, and touching. I'll always remember it.

And when you realize that there are TEN love interests in this game with different scenes like this for each of them, man, that's an intimidating amount of content.

Maybe I shouldn't be saying that Harvest Moon doesn't have any heart at all, but when it comes down to it, this is the game that I'm going to remember more fondly in the end. I made memories with Harvest Moon as a child. Now I'm making memories with Stardew Valley as an adult. You should too. The game is worth full price and then some."

9/10 Stardew Valley is a fantastic casual game for anyone that can enjoy a more relaxed pace of things. This game's simple premise of rebuilding the family farm in a particularly quaint village with an array of fun character's to interact with never feels old. Much of the game is spent trying to make your farm plot perfect to your liking while attempting to maintain relationships with the townfolk. Stardew plays at any pace you want to play at and that is especially rewarding, you will find yourself prioritizing and making chore lists and juggling all of your other duties, but you will do so in a natural rhythym of your own pace and comfort. I am highly awaiting the arrival of the multiplayer update as currently I'm playing with my significant other using a mod for multiplayer - while the mod works, the legitimate update will be much more welcomed! I can't recommend this game enough and once multiplayer is released, I dare say this will be a must-own game for gaming couples!

Edit: Multiplayer has been released and is as amazing as we'd all hoped. This game is an absolute must for all gaming couples. While the multiplayer adds additional player cabins to your property that act as your guest(s) home, they can still sleep in the host's bed and use the main house as if it were their own."

Do not buy this game. You will buy it thinking there's no harm in trying it because it's only $15, then you wall fall in love with it. One day you will want to play it while on the bus, so you will buy it on your tablet. Then your tablet will die and you will buy it on your phone. Then your switch. Then your X-box. Then you buy it for your sister so she can play online with you. Then you realize you can have 4 online players, so you buy it for your boyfriend. And then your sisters boyfriend. And then you realize you have spent $200 and 500 hours on this $15 game.

I am a 55 year old biker and trucker father, and probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories.

I didn't like this game at first and only played it to satisfy my gf.

Now, I'm asking her if we're gonna play it before we even get off of work. It has honestly earned its place in my heart and I'm so glad I gave it a chance.

I didn't think I could love a farming sim ( coming from a FPS/ Dark Souls background) < over 1k hrs on console)
But thus I write this. If you have a GF/friend/son/daughter/wife/husband and you haven't got a game in common this WILL become that game. This game has improved our ability to communicate and plan things together and were both getting so hyped with every bundle we complete.(very satisfying) oh crap ... I just noticed it's only 15$ honestly shocked about that....

Give it a shot, I think i''m gonna start my own solo farm.


The graphics may not be ULTRA HD 4K but when you have a beautiful game-play loop and a town that actually feels alive, all that crap just falls away and you can then see that graphics don't make a game, heart does and this game has a mine! 10/10

This game is just fantastic. Obviously you can see that from the 'overwhelmingly positive' reviews here on Steam, so I will keep this short and try to focus on negatives and things you may overlook in general.

Stardew Valley is what PC gamers have been looking for to scratch that Harvest Moon/Animal Crossing itch. If you like that type of gameplay, just buy this. Don't overthink it. It does it all, and more. What puts it over-the-top is the customization level and modular building ability a la Minecraft/Terraria style. And oh boy is there depth.

Plus, multiplayer is coming!

Pros:
+I mean this was made by one guy?!?
+Beautiful artwork that has attention to details. I mean it even changes dramatically with the seasons. Its incredible.
+Music is absolutely a treat. And once again, changes with the seasons!
+Controller support works ok (I'm just glad it exists).
+Character customization (male/female, sliders for colors, your appearance changes with different gear, etc.).
+You have a large farm to work with. The world in general is a good size. There are 28 NPC's all with their own schedules and agendas. The pixel art for their faces is outstanding.
+You can have a pet, and get married (I haven't even done anything with the latter, yet).
+There is mining and fighting monsters, although the fighting is casual and isn't even completely necessary.
+I could go on and on here really.


-*Sometimes* the controller support part *feels* glitchy until you learn how to use it (mainly the part with the right stick). Nine hours in and I'm still figuring out nuances.
-It would be great if the hotbar were longer so to minimize going into the pause button to juggle things.
-The bin you put stuff in to sell each night should show all of its contents. Why not allow the player to retract items put in right up until they go to bed? Its not a dumpster, so things don't get 'tainted'.

If you like this genre, this is a no brainer."

This game has so much thought and detail put into it. From the little kiss you can give your spouse in the morning, to finding the Mayors underwear in a special someones home, or a little flying witch that could bring you gifts if you are lucky. As a person with very intense anxiety this game helps to calm me down and relax.

Soundtrack and Music - The soundtrack is very calming and peaceful. It's very comforting to listen to as you water crops or mine in the cave. There is always a different song for different events giving it a nice feel good vibe.

Art and Graphics - The game is so beautiful. The art is very adorable and indie. With each different season and each new event or festival you have more quests and more to explore and it all is so stunning.

Characters - The characters are so in depth. They all have a different back story to why they are who they are. They also are mostly kind and sweet once they get used to you and you get used to them.

This game is so much fun and it really goes in depth. This game is one that you can lose track of real time because of how enticing it is. Once you start to get the hang of it there is no putting it down. Then you discover mods which add more game time because they add more to explore.

Overall, the is very fun and beautiful. If you want a good quality and long lasting game this is the game for you.

Down side - There isn't much to say about this game that is bad, especially since mods help make it better. I would love to see working multiplayer to enjoy in game expierence with friends. One other thing is, there is not much of a tutorial for a new player it can be very confusing. It can be confusing on what to do, or how important birthdays are and such can be. But besides these small things the game is amazing."

If you haven't played or seen this game before then I really think you should try it, it's truly excellent and very wholesome.

Playtime and Time/money
At the time of writing this I've put in about 60 hours and the game is 15$, that's 25 cents per hour of enjoyment. If you compare that to 15 1$ tacos you'll quickly see that this is well worth your time and will give you more enjoyment. plus you can come back to it and get more and more out of it. The game can be modded, and plenty of people are more addicted to this game format than I.

Exactly what is this game?
This is a farming simulator RPG with romance and combat, with a heavier emphasis on the role playing part of the game. Its very enjoyable to get into, and it can be played with your friends to make it even more interesting. The only person worthy of my love is krobus, be sure to give them a pumpkin from me. <3"

i was not interested in Stardew Valley at first because farming doesn't seem to be my thing. i bought the game for the new multi-player feature to play it with a couple of friends.

i tried it in single-player mode just to learn the basics, and for the next two weeks, playing this game was basically what i did besides sleeping. this is the first game i have ever spent more than 100 hours on. i didn't know if i spent so much time in Stardew Valley because it was the perfect escape from real life or because i fell in love with the game... but now i know it's both.

i wish i knew that farming is just one of the many things you can do in Stardew Valley. there are so many details and secrets in one small town to be discovered... and you have all the time you need to discover all of them. you can forage and dig up things everywhere, you can socialize with townsfolks - each with unique personalities, likes and dislikes - and fall in love with them, you can mine the heck out of the local mines, and then mine the heck out of a limit-less mine elsewhere. you can play the game however you want, and Pelican Town still stays beautiful and vibrant regardless.

i recommend this game. i know my recommendation is just another one in a sea of positive reviews, but hey, it deserves my recognition still! thank you ConcernedApe and Chucklefish for Stardew Valley. this game is a good time :)"

I bought this game and found it to be pretty fun. On one random occassion, I was on a train headed back to uni when I noticed a person playing Stardew Valley on board the train, her partner sitting beside, watching. I couldn't help but strike up a conversation with them and we immediately bonded over the game which eventually led to really interesting discussions on life. We were headed to different cities at the time but we met up again eventually. Now they're back in their hometown halfway across the world.

The most wholesome game ever created, and is still nurtured by the developer after five years. My nomination for Steam labor of love award 2021.

Stardew Valley is not just a farming sim, it's a life sim; it's not just a video game, it's an experience, and one of the most immersive ones ever existed. Unlike some other Harvest Moon clones that either forces you to grind hard or have tedious progression, Stardew lets you relax, set your own goals, choose your preferred pace and tell your own story. There is so much to do in the game that can't be written in just words, and it just gets better the more hours you put in it.

Only a few games make you feel the love the developers put into them, Stardew is definitely one of them. Best wishes to ConcernedApe for his upcoming game."

Stardew Valley is a fantastic game and it deserves to be played for an infinite number of hours.
I will recommend this game to anyone without any doubt, and in this review, I will try to explain why this game should be played and enjoyed.

My Progress[i.imgur.com]

1. Story
Well the story is quite simple: you are a hard-working person who is employed by a big corporate firm, but you are starting to get flooded with work. Your grandpa has recently died and left you a typed letter which you can open when you are most in need. You think this is the time and you open the letter, whereby your grandpa tells you that when a certain part of life comes you need a change in order to feel normal again. In this case he invites you to go to his farm in the valley which is now unattended.

2. Gameplay
The game offers a huge amount of gameplay mechanics which are very nicely implemented into the game. You have chiefly 6 gameplay mechanics: Farming, Fishing, Mining, Foraging, Combat and Seasons. In my opinion farming is the main focus of the game; you can plant crops, water, protect and harvest them. They are your main source of income. The variety of crops is huge, and since the game has 4 seasons, there are crops which only grow in particular season, while other crops can grow for consecutive seasons.

is quite hard depending on how much time you want to invest in it. Again affect the types of fish you can catch. Catching fish was my main priority in my first hours in the game and my main source of money. It’s quite hard to make money out of fishing, but I found out how to later. You can find treasures while fishing so keep that in mind.
is good for when you get bored of fishing or doing stuff on your farm. It’s very interesting and after couple of visits to the mines you will be planning how many levels you are going to do in 1 day. In the mines you are going to find all kind of items, like minerals, geodes"

So this is a fantasy farming town life sim in the ilk of Harvest Moon so rather then beat around the bush, how does it compare?

Farming: On par with Harvest Moon (HM). Some extra details (need for scarecrows, fencing etc.) but it's also missing features like the ability to selectively breed superior levels of crops over multiple generations. There are some balance concerns but being a PC game those can actually be patched.
Livestock... lacks variety and some complexity but is more realistic in some respects. For example there's no animal taming, just purchasing. Breeding is in but you don't breed better livestock it just replenishes numbers (and is gender blind). Grooming is more detailed but less hands on. The one noteworthy improvement is conceptually allowing and rewarding field rotation.

Relationships: Superior to HM and It's a Fantasy Life (FL), but inferior to Rune Factory (RF). I say superior to HM but really it's about on par in terms of the mechanics but with more romance options (including same sex). It falls behind in terms of character variety, depth and interaction compared to the RF series but updates could easily catch up.

(Note RF improved on the HM formula is pretty much every way so will be comparing primarily to it now)

Mining: On par with RF, Behind FL. One area it is behind in both respects is variety of ores divided by regions. Stardew Valley has 2 locations you can really go mining. They have a lot of levels, which are divided into different biomes and there's some RNG in ore availability on any given trip into the mines but it's still overall more simplistic terms of layout and progression. Where it really lags behind is the actual mining interaction. It's just click on the rock, it breaks, RNG loot.

Lumberjacking: This ones complicated as it's been mixed with the concept of Foraging. Lumberjacking by itself it close but still behind RF and way behind FL. Foraging also adds features such as getting tree seeds off trees for immediate replanting, finding seasonal wild plants (which you can in turn get seeds for and farm, eliminating the wild foraging once you've completed that seasons set), and at certain times of the year collecting berries. The other titles has these features (coloured grasses and fruit trees etc) but they weren't tied to a skill you could improve. Much room to improve here, especially in terms of the mechanics.

Fishing: Ahead of RF, Close but still Behind FL. Something that must immediately be pointed out is fishing difficulty isn't staggered so there's an easy progression curve. Where as in the other games the seasonal fish in the locations you have access to at the start are easy to catch & get harder as you unlock more areas and progress to later seasons, Stardew will throw you in the deep end right at the start before you have any skill. Plus the RNG will throw top level fish at you to kick your butt again & again. Practising the skill and improving equipment alleviates this over time but a lot of people think fishing is impossible starting out as although there are easy fish to catch to start, you aren't directed to them and RNG can still screw you. The mechanics themselves work well once you are on top of them but still more depth that could be added to compare to FL, but otherwise quite good.

Combat: Behind RF and FL. There's no real depth to the combat. 3 noteworthy weapon types (and you'll mostly just use swords) plus bombs (which you wont use in combat), no spells, no special moves (right click does do an alternate thing like block or ground slam, but it's not effective and you will never do it), no companions, no real footwork, just move close and spam attack over and over until enemy dies. The only tactical considerations are more frustration with the controls then strategy. Enemy variety is lacking compared to the others. First 80 levels there's only 3 varieties of enemies, those who passively stand there, ones that charge you (grounded or flying), and ones that charge you but occasionally block (one that burrows to do so). For all the above the strategy is pretty much the same: Maybe dodge, hit them before they hit you, keep hitting. Then they add enemies that shoot at you, same deal. Much room for improvement. That said the RNG nature of the dungeons leaves a lot or potential open for this to be developed further if the dev decided to so.

Crafting: Way behind RF and FL. No weapon/armour crafting at all. Equipment upgrades handled by a shop. Cooking and deco pieces are just click to create. Super simplistic and uninteractive. That said, there is one area of it where it is ahead of both RF and FL.
Decoration... In addition to the ability to lay fences, paths etc. you get to prepare and place the foundation for additional farm buildings rather then the usual fixed locations when you unlock them. Except your house & greenhouse. You are free to place a large amount of functional and decorative furniture both (craftable & collectable) largely anywhere you want on the farm & to some extent all over the town as well. Doesn't compare with say Ultima, or a Minecraft/Terraria clone (omission intentional) but it's a big step up within this genre.

Festivals: Far behind RF. Once you've seen them once most the time you want to skip festivals in Stardew. They are mostly just low interaction cut scenes that waste your entire day (even when the festival says it will end at 2pm, you'll get home at 10pm, day over). You can't give gifts, go shopping or otherwise really interact with the townsfolk in any meaningful way on most festival days and very few of the festivals will attending offer any kind of benefit. The townsfolk don't really acknowledge your prowess or even if you attended at all or not.

Story: Behind RF & FL. The story is very simple and very lightly applied. The one interesting aspect of it is it seems to make a social commentary on small town independents vs corporate growth culture... But it's doesn't seem to penalise or judge the player regardless of which they favour, it just complements two different playstyles respectively.
The plot really boils down to if your characters presence improves the lives of the other townsfolk in any noteworthy fashion over the course of 2 years or not. The hands off approach is great if you don't want the game jamming plot events down your throat while you want to focus on the farming sim, but it means when you are looking for context it is relying entire on the depth of it's character interactions, where it is sadly lacking compared to it's rivals.
These aren't shallow characters, but the arcs are short and arbitrary and there is very little individual interaction throughout. Some scripted events are cool but like the festivals the characters have no real self awareness of how they went down after the fact.

Collection: On par or better then RF/FL. Behind Animal Crossing. :-P
Good potential here. Museum collection will be expanded in updates too.

Art/Music: Subjective but good quality regardless.

Overall: If you are looking for a story based game with more interactive gameplay mechanics It's a Fantasy Life is a better choice. As far as farming sim specifically goes Rune Factory has more depth and still stands as personal best in genre. I haven't mentioned polish until now as although Stardew is behind all competitors this is day 4 since release and there have been no less then 4 patches fixing most major issues and many smaller ones. When you consider this game was made by one person with no production studio to cover exhaustive QA it's unsurprising launch has been a little shaky. But regular patching will fix this (Edit: & largely has). An advantage of a PC release. Do I recommend it? Absolutely. It might not be best in genre but it's a solid entry, has the potential to improve and is definitely already the best on the PC platform and by extension steam.

If the genre appeals to you, get it. Easily worth the money."

""When you gaze long into the abyss, the abyss gazes also into you.” - Friedrich Nietzsche

Some people may have told you that Stardew Valley is a ""chill"" game about farming and making friends. Someone might have told you that this is an easy going, relaxing game that can be enjoyed by anyone, even those who don't normally play video games. Those people were wrong. For me, Stardew Valley is not really a game at all; it is a mirror, reflecting within it the darkness of the human condition, and my own inability to escape it.

At the time of this review, I have logged 114 hours into this game. I have completed the community center in it's entirety, and I have perfectly optimized my farm for brutal efficiency. I make millions of dollars each season, and, for no good reason, I continue pushing just to see how grotesque and gaudy my industrial hellscape can become. I have never spoken to a single member of the town who cannot benefit me monetarily; if you asked, I would likely only be able to name 5 NPCs at best. I almost never go to the town events and have often found them to simply be obstacles or annoyances in my personal quest for power. This game may be relaxed for some, but for me, it is war. There shall be no item left unpurchased, no crop left ungrown, and no slime left unslain. I am become Death, destroyer of worlds.

If you share a desire for ruthless expansion and power, this game is for you. Conversely, if you just want to have a cute little farm and role-play a simple but idyllic rural fantasy, this game is probably also for you. Either way, if you value your mental health, or maintaining *actual* productivity, the abyss is best left un-gazed upon."

This game saved my life.

I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you

~EDIT~

A lot of people were upset I didn't share the things I enjoyed about the game in detail. Below you will find my personal experience in the short amount of time I spent playing.

I spent most of my time fighting slimes with a sword and mining the ore in the dungeon.. haha, but I also made some money off plants. I didn't spend much time getting to know the townsfolk. I got irritated that weeds kept growing in my garden, but I kept plucking them and it was sort of rewarding to keep my map weed free. That's about all I can say other than digging up treasures that would show up in the dirt. I had just planted some plant that cost me like 1000 gold, and I built a water irrigation system around that, and my other plants. It was struck by lightning shortly after... lol, my best friend actually played for several hours with me which was unexpected, and since we shared gold he and I kept screwing each other over for fun. I just saw an update that may be fixing that ""issue"" however, and either way I intend to pick up the game again and play it much more in depth when my winter season comes and work slows down. My 20 hours of enjoyment."

At first Ive added this game to my Wishlist because it got really popular so I got interested in it.
Later during Christmas I got it as a gift from a close friend and it stayed untouched for a while as I was simply playing other games. But lately my depression have taken turn for the worse and Ive lost any will to play games.
One day when I was feeling especially bad Ive decide to try this game only because it seemed easy and I needed something to make my mind busy.
To my surprise... this game helped. Without realising Ive spent several hours taking care of my virtual farm and and for the first time in weeks I felt calm, happy even. Since then it has become my safe place I go to when I feel really down.
In short, I really Recommend this game if youre looking for something relaxing. And if you know anyone who is going through hard times, show them this game, it might also help them.

tl;dr - 10/10 , great for anyone feeling depressed"

This game took my soul. Oh yeah play Stardew Valley. A cute little farming simulator. The event that occurred next nobody could have predicted. An event of great magnitude and catastrophic cost. I have dedicated the past month to achieving all 40 achievements this game throws at you. It starts out easy. Oh yeah get 50,000 gold. Oh nice, cook 25 recipes. However what they don't tell you is the majority of the achievements are only gained at the end. And I don't use the word end lightly. It took me 3 in game years to achieve this feat. Yes it can be done in two, but at this point, 2 years? 3 years? 10 years? it all feels the same. The monotonous tasks of filling casks with fruit to make wine. Grinding for the mythic prismatic shards. It takes so long. And none of these tasks are boring, or un-fun. The entire time I was thrilled. But I lost a part of myself somewhere along the journey. Something that I will never get back. Maybe it was when I accidentally spent all my qi gems on 250 qi seasoning, or maybe it was the time I mis-clicked a mega bomb after finishing designing a part of my farm. Wherever, whenever I lost that part of myself doesn't matter. Its gone for good. All we can do now is look to the future. Keep our heads up and keep on marching. Maybe one day I may wake up and it will all feel like a bad dream. And only then will I be able to rejoin society as a normal person once more. Someone not scarred by the wound only Stardew Valley could inflict. Maybe I will feel okay again. Maybe

10/10 Would play again."

This game resonated deep within my psyche and awoke ancestral memories from uncountable past generations of farmers time immemorial.

The feeling was so strong that I completely altered my life plans, bought a small farm in the middle of diddle-do nowhere, and am more or less living the game irl. However I am so busy learning how to farm that I don't have time to play Stardew Valley anymore.

> lots of talking
> finally think i met everyone
> try to interact with trashcan
> find a salad in trash, untouched
> girl sees me digging in trash
> girl gets grossed out from me digging in the trash
> get mad, decide to follow her
> catch her walking towards lake
> turns out shes pretty
> want to know how to marry her
> find out that i can gift people
> dont know what to gift
> remembered i had salad from the trash that she saw me grab
> give salad to her
> she loves it
> advance a year or two later

Those pumpkins were worth a lot of money! I think it's about time I upgrade my pickaxe and then I can go explore the mines for a bit, just gotta wait a couple of days so I can pick it up from the Blacksmith.

Got the pickaxe, time to go into the mine! Hm, I made it to level 25 today, I bet I can go way deeper if I bring a bunch of food with me tomorrow!

Got to level 60, sweet! Found some gold ore down there as well! Just one more day...

You know what game doesn't need my review? Stardew Valley. There's nothing I could possibly say about it that other people have not said yet, but it's criminally unfair to have played so much of it without rating it. So I'm going to rate it.

If you enjoy resource scarcity games without strict deadlines, a charming, colorful world with thoughtful characters, logistical planning and min-maxing strategy - I mean, it's all here. If you've played Graveyard Keeper, or Littlewood, or Harvest Moon from back in the day, and liked them at all - you owe it to yourself to play Stardew Valley. It is insanely cheap for the amount of value ConcernedApe has packed into it, and he continues to develop interesting, fun new wrinkles in regular updates. Every time I start over I find things I missed before."

Short Review Version
This is what I did for thousands of hours in Stardew Valley:
I worked on this guide since the first release.
I've tested 477 items for 15741 times to 33 villagers,
I've chopped tons of woods,
I've smashed tons of stones,
I've reset the game for hundreds of times,
And I almost lost this guide because my hard disk corrupted.
In case of another disaster,
So I've to release this halfway works,
Whatever I currently have.

I believe Wiki's info are slightly inaccurate. That's why I make my own data references. You can still refer to Wiki if some info is missing in this guide. This guide will be continuously updated when I have free time. I may be busy at life, but I'll try to push updates to this guide. As multiplayer mode rolling up soon, I will include that as well.




Once I played Harvest Moon: Back to Nature on PlayStation 1 and Harvest Moon: Friends of Mineral Town in Gameboy Advance. Then I continued to play HM:FOMT in VisualBoy Advance in PC, GBA4iOS for iOS and GameBoid for Android. I went for plantations, mining, fishing, feeding animals, wooing all the cute girls. Unlimited fun hours.

""Dude, which girl are you chasing?""
""Elli.""
""Just pass your game cartridge to me for a day; I'll make her grow to red heart in no time!""
""Then help me to get 999,999,999G for Vacation House!""

We swapped GBA game cartridges, grinding it all the time after school hours. That was my childhood memories.

It all began when a friend of mine told me about Stardew Valley which arrives into Steam Store. A game that packs most of Harvest Moon features, which I played back from ten years’ time. I went on checking at Steam Store. Apparently, it looks similar as Harvest Moon, but I doubt how fun it is. All the while, the only farming simulator I loved was Harvest Moon. None other than that. Thankfully, my friend borrowed his Steam Library to me. For the first two hours, I was surprised that finally, FINALLY... A real farming simulator on PC platform. We do no longer running on emulators.

So the first month, as usual, I cleared my land, planting Parsnips and then went hunting for extra berries and grasses. But alas, what I noticed inside was totally blew my mind. No grasses but with different loots and proper item names. Dandelion, Daffodil, Spring Onion, Leek, Grapes, Hazelnuts. And then, there's Bus Stop. An overhauled open town that doesn't vertically or horizontally aligned compared to old Harvest Moon. Quests. Fresh storylines. Tons of letters and goodies in my mailbox. Combat mode in Mines. And MINECARTS!

This Stardew Valley is a new fresh farming simulator. At first, I'm at lost, but since I'm an ex-Harvest Moon addict, I still can keep up with the crops. However, challenges turn in which you have to defend your crops from overgrown weeds or crow attacks. Something new, you can feel it. In my first run, I used to be a monopolist. Spent all my money on seeds and gained maximum profits. But then, the funny part I placed almost more than 20 scarecrows to protect my crops.

I've no idea how far a scarecrow range can cover, how to simultaneously plant and harvest crops, how to organise items and much more. In my thoughts, there might be Steam Guide that helps players to play better. It took me few minutes to load a whole guide with heavy images. Images are wonderful, but still a lack of some details. And much to my disappointment, lots of guides in Steam Community are heavily plagiarised with the assistance from Wiki.

Ten years ago, as far as I remembered, game guides for Wiki hardly existed (Or maybe there's one?). Remember how we used CC Cheat Codes, IGN Walkthroughs, , and many more old sites? Veteran players are very well-versed at this. Most guides are solely written in text format. The tradition of writing text guide is fading. No comprehensive Steam Guide for Stardew Valley community ever had done this.

I stopped my game in the middle of Winter, Year 1. Over the months, I compiled all items and complete gifting. Day by day, data by data is being added to my works. One day, my portable disk went corrupted and thankfully my only backup still resided in my local disk. Thus, I've made my final decision to post my works in and Steam Community as what you've seen right now.

I as a fan of Harvest Moon and Stardew Valley would like to thank all of the public contributors who had spent years to compile and posted detailed online walkthroughs for everyone to enjoy HM games, and now we're moving on to Stardew Valley. I wanted to do the same extensive guide for Stardew Valley. Also not forget to thank all my close friends who had helped me to test and verify game data too. As I continue to compile the remaining data, your feedbacks are greatly appreciated.

Feels like I'm relieving back some good ol' memories. Soon I'll have my own printed Stardew Valley guidebook on my bookshelf for my collection. Maybe I’ll be playing this for another ten years. Thanks, Stardew Valley."

Great game. Anyway here's a lemon pie recipe:

Graham Cracker Crust:
1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs
1/4 cup granulated white sugar
6 tbsp melted butter

Lemon Filling:
2 x 14-oz cans sweetened condensed milk
1 cup fresh lemon juice
6 egg yolks
2 tbsp finely grated lemon zest

Method:
-Preheat oven to 350°F / 180°C
-Mix the crust. Add the graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and melted butter into a mixing bowl and stir until well combined.
-Transfer the crumb mixture into a 9-in / 23 cm deep-dish pie pan. Press the crumbs tightly into the bottom and up the sides of the pie dish. Set aside.
-Mix filling. Pour the sweetened condensed milk into a large mixing bowl and add the egg yolks and lemon zest. Whisk to combine. Add the lemon juice and whisk vigorously until well combined and you no longer see any juice. The lemon juice will thicken the condensed milk.
-Bake. Pour the lemon filling into the prepared pie crust. Bake 25 to 30 minutes. The lemon pie is done when the edges are set and only slightly jiggly in the centre.
-Cool & refrigerate. Remove the pie from the oven and let cool on a wire rack. Once cool, cover the pan and refrigerate until firm for at least 3 hours before serving.
-Garnish. Decorate the pie as desired. I dressed up my pie with puffs of whipped cream, lemon slices, a sprinkle of lemon zest, and sliced almonds.

I didn't really consider this game til' somewhere this year when a friend of mine bought me this game as a present. I expected this game to be a regular farming game where you repeat the same task of plant, harvest, sell, upgrade, repeat, with some NPCs that can give you some daily missions to help you progress faster. But this game had me completely immersed every time I booted it up. This game isn't only about farming and efficiency, but it's about living the life of a resident who just moved into a new town to find a more fulfilling life. You're categorized as a farmer, but you also have side hobbies and a social life as any other human being would. As a farmer, you plant a variety of seeds, and care for your farm animals. You can then sell the produce to help the community thrive. According to the grandma the grumpy old geezer likes tulips, maybe you could give him the left over tulip you kept in your chest. Though if you're tired of farming, you could go collect sea shells for fun and sell them for a quick buck so you could buy that slick sword you were eyeing at earlier, or you could enjoy fishing for salmon at a riverbank using that sick new fishing rod you just bought. Though working can be tiring, maybe going to the town festival can help you relax, that purple haired girl seems nice, maybe you could go befriend her by giving her a purple geode you got earlier from mining. What I'm trying to get at is this game is a masterpiece that can pull you into it's immersive gameplay. I wouldn't say this game is for everyone, maybe you're into the satisfying feeling of mercilessly killing demons, or maybe you're a masochist that finds it fun for all your progress be demolished by a minor mistake. But if you want a game that can help you be at ease and immerse you into playing for hours, then this is a game I can 100% recommend to you."

There is a character in this game that is suffering from depression, it has helped me see my own illness and I have learned to deal with it in a much healthier way soley because of how my character interacts and helps them. The characters in this game are beautiful, and not just in their artwork. Their stories and the cutscenes have drawn me in more than just a regular farming game. I was truely excited to marry Leah and nervous that she would turn me down (Even though she was at 10 hearts and I knew she wouldn't). I have spent 80 hours in this game so far and I am in spring of year 3 waiting on my first child. This game has kept my attention and I am looking forward to many more hours.

Stardew Valley is an uniquely entertaining game. Even though it appeals more to casual gamers, this game has a lot to offer. Whether you are interested in combat, farming, fishing, socializing, etc., Stardew Valley has is the thing.

I must begin by saying that the art style of the game is just purely beautiful. I can't think of something that would fit better for a game like Stardew Valley. It's really neat, seeing games that aren't afraid to take a more minimalistic approach and succeed. The soundtrack is also a key element in the experience, and it delivers. Not only does it perfectly fit the game's atmosphere, but it is also one of those soundtracks you'll dearly listen to even outside of the game.

The premise of the game is simple. Life in the city finally overwhelms you. You decide to open the last gift your grandfather gave you before he died. He left you his farm in Stardew Valley, and so your journey begins. You are greeted by an abandoned plot of land which you must restore to its former glory and by the nice little community of Pelican Town, a small town near your farm. So you start discovering the joy of a simple life there, day by day, as you slowly but steadily gain the trust of the citizens, turn a profit from the crops you grow back at your farm and join the Adventurer's Guild to fight the threats in a nearby mine. Saying more would spoil the beauty of discovering that little community on your own.

The gameplay is straightforward: you take care of your plot of land to grow crops and that's about it. No end goal. No limits. No hand-holding. You are left to discover the beautiful life in Pelican Town bit by bit, since you can do pretty much everything you'd want to. The controls and mechanics are simple, but sometimes less is more.

The one thing that I really liked about the game was the passage of time. You get to enjoy all of the seasons, each of them coming with its perks and disadvantages. You get to grow different crops based on the season you currently play through and the npc's also react differently. There's holidays to be celebrated, friendships to be discovered and romance to be had!

If you think you can enjoy a relaxing, slow-paced game like Stardew Valley, then go ahead and buy it, do yourself a favour. Altough the game might not be for everyone, it is certainly worth a try. But be careful, It may become quite addicting :)

TL;DR: A nice little game about life in a small town, with plenty of combat, farming, socializing and much more. Build your farm from scratch and start making profit, try to solve the mystery behind Pelican Town or even get married. Truly the best experience for when you just want to unwind from a long day and play a nice little peaceful game. Stardew Valley has a bit of everything, for everyone."

After spending 50+ hours on it, I figured Stardew Valley is due for a review.

Story/Characters: While not heavily driven by the story, Stardew Valley sets up your farm-life, and fills it, with many solid, and fun cutscenes. You'll also run into a few nuggets of lore occasionally. Every villager in Stardew Valley is unique, and worth getting to know. 9/10

Gameplay: The farming life has never been better. I fell in love with farming, then with fishing, then with mining. All these are valid methods of keeping a steady income in Stardew Valley. So, I had fun devoting days to different activities, while also completing different quests and requests from the villagers. Also, there are mods, which I haven't even gotten into yet. 9.5/10

Sound: Relaxing, colorful, and happy music kept me humming while doing my daily work. The sound effects were also bright, and they fit in perfectly 9/10

Replay Value: I played Stardew Valley for 45+ hours. In that time, I completed 1.5 ""years"", got married, earned quite a lot of items and money, and finished the community center. That might satisfy most; I plan to do it all again, with a few mods. 8/10

Overall Score: 8.9

Summary: Personally, I had a ton of fun with Stardew Valley, and will never forget this game. Thanks to ConcernedApe for this awesome game. I love the crap out of it. Everyone should at least try it. Begin your life in Stardew Valley"

Not only has this game been inspired by Harvest Moon, but also praised by the creator of it. It takes the shortcomings of Harvest Moon and gives you freedom to do much more. If you're tired of pretentious and toxic games, then take a break and get Stardew Valley, this charming little title will even cure your depression."

I don't typically write reviews, but I felt inclined to do one for this game. It really does feel like an old school harvest moon, but brought up to date. The gameplay is pretty much exactly what you would expect out of this type of game. The combat is a little wonky but still fun. The game does kind of chuck you in without much of an explanation, and those are honestly the only two downsides I could give it.

The pros more than outweigh the cons, I haven't been this hooked on a harvest moon-esque game since the original. But, to me the largest selling point is the one person developing this game, actually cares. The first 2 days the game is out, there has already been 4 updates fixing issues everyone asked to be fixed. The game has been shown an amazing amount of love even after everyone had already paid for it.

A+ Developer, and a lot of fun, all there is to really say about this game."

This game is fantastic! I love it! Every single of it. I got it as a present from good old dear friend of mine 2 years ago, and then I launched it, played for 50 minutes and deleted it again. Now in 2020 I installed it again, because I still had it as good game in the back of my head. So I installed it, and started playing. In 2 weeks I clocked 60 hours in this game. It's amazing. I love how relaxing it is, the music is incredible, there are so many things you can do, like mining, farming, gathering, producing, automating, animal farming, relationships, fishing and so much more. It's a masterpiece!
Give it a chance, please. It was developed with a lot of love by a single person, over 4 years. It's a 2D game, which may not be appealing to many, but give it a try, would ya?"

“If you're reading this, you must be in dire need of a change. The same thing happened to me, long ago. I'd lost sight of what mattered most in life... real connections with other people and nature. So I dropped everything and moved to the place I truly belong.” Yeah, where's that, grandpa? A sleepy, unassuming town in the middle of nowhere that harbors dark secrets beneath its glossy veneer, with some standouts being unending and unresolvable family issues and tragedies, debilitating personal vices involving substance abuse and adultery, and a ? Damn, pops, if this is the place you truly belong, I don't think I want to know the place where you came from before that.

Don't let people fool you into thinking this is a chill, relaxing, game. It is one of the most stressful farm-life simulators I've ever had the pleasure of buying more than three times across multiple devices and platforms. Sure, the game starts out innocently enough: your dear grandpa bequeaths you a farm, inviting you to escape ""the burden of modern life"" where you're tasked with rehabilitating its dilapidated acreage by transforming it from an OSHA-inspector's wet dream into a fully operational profit-churning machine whose yearly revenue can rival the GDP of a small nation. A small ask.

Little does the game prepare you though for the various monkey wrenches it throws your way while you stand there like an idiot, pick in hand, not knowing the first thing about farm life because—let's face it—you're a soulless city-slicker whose ""bright spirit"" was already destined to ""fade before a growing emptiness"" (gee thanks grandpa for keeping it real I guess). Little obstacles, like: tools not being good enough to clear that damn stump/boulder; having to build relationships with country bumpkins whose realities are so different and in some cases so f***ed up you have no idea how to even begin to relate with them just so you can get access to various recipes as well as the one mirror in all of Stardew Valley that'll let you change your clothes and hairstyle; and constantly being reminded of the relentless march of time ever tick-tocking towards the end of a productive workday filled with tilling, planting, watering, running 20 miles back and forth between farm and town, mining, fishing, , and—just as importantly—socializing with the town's poor, unfortunate souls who are just as stuck here as you are but lack any agency in escaping the fates of their own making. Oh but god forbid you try staying up past 2am just to fit everything in this busy schedule, no, not healthy for you!

Eventually you learn the tricks of the trade to earn you your first thousand, then hundred thousand, then million gold. You navigate the mazes of interpersonal relationships and escape the labyrinth wedded to a partner willing enough to spend the rest of their tiresome life with you. You figure out what exactly it is that this town needs to restore the magic that your grandpa once saw in it, and after driving out the oppressive force of capitalist greed that plagued the inhabitants of Stardew Valley for years...

So no, Stardew Valley is a feel-good, lackadaisy wonderland full of flowers and rainbows that you can jump into after a loaded day to . I mean sure, you play it more relaxed than how I describe, by actually taking your time to soak in the game's beautiful art and catchy music, fully appreciating the work of a single developer whose entire focus and passion were poured into making such a beloved videogame worthy of adoration in the same breath as classic Legend of Zelda and Super Mario titles. You do that... but the Community Center won't rebuild itself, and Penny's birthday is just around the corner.

This is why I can't stop buying it every time it's re-released on a new platform. 10/10 would farm again."

Stardew Valley has helped get me through the most horrific experience of my life.
