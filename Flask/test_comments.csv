Spoiler Warning

First Game of German Developer Mooneye (hopefully not the last one) who started with a 2016 Kickstarter Campaign and bring this with a Small Team 2019.

You are a sleeping nameless Wolf. Than you got found from a Lost Ember, that cant speak to any Animal than you. Now you try get out of your Place together & find Destiny.

Strange is why the Wolf on such a lonely well hidden Place, how he comes to there, why is this and many Places under different Domes, that only breaks if you watch a special Memory?

Than after Prologue you have 6 Chapters to explore, find 77 Collectables (some are Easter Eggs from Super Mario (Strange Pipe, Achievements), Legend of Zelda (Triforce, Ocarina; Its Dangerous to Go Alone Achievement), Pokemon (Pokeball, Go Catch Them all Achievement for 6 Legendarys) Portal (Cube)), all Memorys and many different Mushrooms/ Seaflowers (142), 6 Legendary Light Animals & an Epilogue for the Ending.

Sometimes is strange how the People comes over so many big Pits (many old bridges must be broken in the past) because you can take any Animal (there are a lot, but only a few are really useful like Fish & Birds. Worms, Turtles, Sloth. They are to slow (not only in Slow Motion Mode) or dont even want to move completely. Some Animals have usage because they are small and can roll, dig, break special Walls (Elephant, Bull, Goat). But the Animal is most very close so no hard puzzle.

This is a Walking Simulator/ Explorer Game. No big Riddles. Sometimes you can break a Wall as a Mole to let fall down a Tower. Thats it. You only need right Animal.

So this is more a Game focused on Story (nothing to special, some find it boring, some interesting, i like it, even if its sad at the End to let the Wolf alone, i wished we could follow too.

The Graphics really are good for this. Even with 30 Euros its still more a Indie or AA+ Game. Its Minimalistics with Objectives but i think its fits. Like it or not. Watch Screens/ Video. I like it.

Sound is fine. At the very End there is a Song, i heared a lot of Time because Guide and I love this Song, even after 3-5 Times still hearable. Dont aspect to much. I like it.

+++ Unique Stil/ Gameplay for People who want to Relax & Discover

++ The 4 Easter Eggs

+ Chapter Select (seeing which Level you missed Collectables, Mushrooms, Memorys for Steam Achievements is Missing

+ 100 % Easy Steam Achievements (but sometimes well hidden collectable Stuff)

+ 15 Trading Cards (5 Cards would be perfect, 6 super, 7 good)

--- If you dislike Walking Simulators, this will be boring

-- Game Time, if you rush through you will be done in maybe 1-3 hours only

- high Price, get it with 50-75 % Discount on a Store or FAIR Bundle (without 30 % for Steam), Support Developer please

- still some Bugs like stucking in the Wall with Bull (sometimes you must figure out the right Control like R for RAMMING)

- start Problems with the Camera Control but after a few Times it should run smoothly like it did at me (set it from 50 % to 25 % sensivity)

If you love Cute Stuff without Action, Explorer Games/ Walking SImulators/ Relaxing Games without Top Graphics or a Easy Game for 100 % Steam Achievement this Game could be YOURS. If not, than AVOID IT.

Thx 4 Reading. Hopefully you Enjoy . If you like this Review. Please give me a fair Like. Thx 4 your Time & Help.

If only 2 People enjoy this Game because of reading & buying this Game. I am already Happy/ Satiesfied

For every objectively Critic/ Commentary to make this Review better, i am deeply grateful <3

Happy Gaming <3 Good Luck & Have Fun"

Very nice art, soundtrack, and game, but not worth $30 for 4 hours of gameplay. Wait for a sale."

It's a nice game but if possible PLEASE PLEASE add motion blur toggle off in settings, since I couldn't find one. I have BAD motion sickness and I got it so often playing the game and took so many breaks I just stopped playing it as of this post since the gaming experience was not worth the bouts of dizziness I got."

I'd followed this game for many years before it's release (any unique game with playable creatures always interests me).
This year I found myself continually checking up on it (especially in the week leading up to it's confirmed release), just to see artwork, or listen to some music.
I completed a full play-through on Lost Ember's day of release in about 7.5 hours, I explored the world quite a bit, however I did not find all collectables.
Here's what I can say about my experience playing through Lost Ember;

- The music is beautiful, I feel like there should be more music played throughout the game though.
- The art style is unique and mysterious (some models can look and feel a bit ""stiff"" sometimes).
- The story is engaging, but I feel like I've known the story before from elsewhere?
- Has a similar vibe to other indie titles focusing on rich story-telling, think Journey, ABZU and Bound.
- I enjoyed the ending to this story, and I was able to develop theories of my own after my experience.

I thoroughly enjoyed playing this game, and I recommend it, especially for the music and creative style. I know these games are not to every single person's tastes, however.
I'll be following Mooneye Studios for the foreseeable future, and looking forward to many more games they develop, if they continue to do so.
I know a lot of other people have felt this game to be ""charming"" and/or ""endearing"". I found it to be rather grim - a story about death, and forgiveness, and human nature."

""One of the most beautiful ways you could possibly spend 5 hours.""

I have played through the story of this game and I feel I have enough time in to offer up a review. I will be structuring it in sections which will be: Strengths, Weaknesses, Value, then Summation.

Strengths:
-By far the best part of this game is the artwork. It's like playing a painting. The art is fresh looking, well done, and absolutely gorgeous. I feel like you could take a screenshot from literally anywhere in the game and it would look beautiful. Colors are vibrant, the music is great, sound design is absolutely top notch. The sound design and art direction for this game are spot on and the whole thing is just an absolute feast for the senses, which I appreciate over almost anything in these types of games. Yeah, that's the best way I can put it, it's like playing a painting. Beautiful.
-The physical parts of the game feel expansive, even for the short story that it is. The art direction was done in such a way to create open, spanning worlds that feel huge and infinite.
-I like how they modified some animals to be ""not quite"" real animals. They look like they BELONG in the world, and fill their role. I guess the best way I can describe how this is and how I appreciate it is that ""the game uses the IDEA of a type of animal, rather than trying to put every individual species in the game."" I like this approach.
-Every animal feels unique. They are all fun to play and fill a role in the world.
-All the animals are adorably modeled and animated.
-The best part of this game for me, is running through the various worlds and areas as different animals, making this into more or less a type of 3D platformer where you shapeshift for changing circumstances.
-The game flows well. I rarely found myself getting stuck for very long. It is also very gracious with hints and nudges along the way to keep you on track.

Weaknesses:
-I did not find the story to be exceptionally captivating. It was a nice story, there isn't anything wrong with it, but I didn't feel immersed in the storyline, or that there was anything new or different about it. It was sufficient and filled its role, but did not blow me away. It had some nice twists and it was a sweet story but I didn't find myself truly wound up in the character's personalities. What this game perhaps has in visual and auditory beauty, it somewhat lacks in depth of story.
-I found the lack of facial animation on the wolf to be somewhat unnerving. The body was very well animated, as are the other animals in the game, but the eyes of the wolf in all the cutscenes kind of threw me off and I found myself focusing on the fact that it never blinks rather than getting emotionally invested in the story. Even some minor movement of the eyes would have made the wolf more expressive. I understand that real animals don't have expressions, but that's the beauty of games. This really only applies to the face, as the body animations were very good. HOWEVER, this criticism is not to say anything negative about the model itself. I am totally in love with the overall design, just like all the other animals, that part falls right in line with the rest of the game.
-Some of the scripting/dialogue chosen for the ""lost ember"" is not my favorite. Overall, I appreciate its presence and it lends itself well to highlighting the game's crucial moments. However, I would have appreciated some of the hints to be a bit more vague, especially during cutscenes. This may have been some of my problem with the story. I don't even mind that they're narrated with the lost ember's voice, but some of the choice of dialogue seems to always describe what you can already see happening, or doesn't allow my mind to process it. It's hard to explain exactly how I would improve it but I think my problem is that the dialogue seems forced and not natural, as if the lost ember has done this already a few times and is trying its hardest to make it seem like this is a totally new thing, but the way it's written suggests false surprise at the cutscenes.
-The voice acting is just OK. I suppose I shouldn't be too harsh as this is not a AAA title, it's a small game made by a small studio. The voice acting just didn't seem to fit the best. This is a minor complaint as it was OK overall.
-The game is too short. I want more. And I mean that in the best way I possibly can. It's so beautiful I didn't want it to end. This is how much I love looking at this game. I wish it was longer or had some more replayability, but after one playthrough I think I am done indefinitely. It took me about 5 hours to get through, and without any more depth to the story or any more worldbuilding to be had, it is now off of my backlog and into more or less of an archive, a memory. A fond memory, but a memory nonetheless.
-I don't find myself compelled to collect all the artifacts or ""see all the stuff"" - The game contains a system of a few different things you can ""collect"" - Artifacts, mushrooms, and legendary animals. You encounter them in the world, and best I can tell, that's it. You found the thing. You interacted with the thing. It's now in your encyclopedia, that's it. The story still goes on identically whether you pick up all of them or you pick up none of them or, like me, you pick up about 1/3 of them because they happen to be along the pathway. Now, I'm making an assumption they don't have any real bearing in the game. That assumption is based on the fact that I beat the game and got a credits roll without being prompted or urged to get the items, and was not blocked in my progress by lacking any of them. If they change anything in any way, then it is not obvious to me what that is. Yeah, some of them might be related to your character as it appears in the story, but you the player don't gain any feeling for these items at any point. Since they seem to do nothing but unlock achievements, I am not finding myself compelled to go back and collect all the items for completeness' sake. Perhaps a younger me would be more completist. This would be a totally different story if there was more replayability and the items you collected were useful in some way in that world.
-There is not much replayability. As said above, in my mind this is a sort of ""one and done"" story. I wish it wasn't, but that's the particular box my brain has put this game into due to what is presented. What would have brought me back longer? I would honestly love, once you complete the game, if there was a sandbox type mode where you could really sit and explore all the different animals and environments. Yes, I know you can re-play chapters, but, you are limited on what animals can exist where - You literally cannot proceed past certain points without certain animals. In the story/during the normal game this is fine, but I would desire a sort of fun sandbox where I could just spend hours soaring around as an eagle or a parrot or swimming as a fish, whatever it is. But such a feature is apparently not implemented in the game. This is okay. I still love the game for what it is.

Value:
-I waited to get this game during the winter sale. I paid 17.99 which I think is just about spot on for how much enjoyment I got out of the game.
-At 30 dollars normal price, I am a bit more hesitant, this does not mean the game is bad, it just lacks replayability for me.

Summation:
-I thoroughly enjoyed the audio visual aspect of this game. It is a truly beautiful game for the senses. I wish it were perhaps a bit more mentally and emotionally stimulating, but it does not entirely disappoint at all in those regards. I hope you do not see the length of my criticisms and get the impression that I did not like the game, because that definitely was not the case. I really enjoyed it overall, and if another game comes out down the line under a similar premise or in the same universe, I'm definitely interested."

A story about forgiveness and redemption
Lost Ember departs from being a typical video game that focuses on fighting or puzzle-solving to tell a heartfelt story. It's an adventure game in which you will explore the ruins of an ancient empire from the perspective of a Wolf in search of their place in the world. Armed with the ability to control every animal you encounter, you must find a path to the city where your wolf companion's questions will be answered while searching for lost memories. Amazing story telling, stunning art, beautiful graphics, a breathtaking world to explore, a variety of collectibles to collect, beautiful music, a soothing environment, a touching story that will leave you in tears, and simply a magical experience. Lost Ember is a unique and unforgettable piece of art that you need to play no matter your preferences, especially if you love animals and nature. A truly hidden gem that I can't recommend enough and it's the best indie game I've ever played."

Lost Ember, one of my favorite games is really special. The visuals are beautiful and the animals are extra cute. Exploring different parts of the world, each from different perspective (wombats, fish, ducks, goats, buffaloes, armadillos, elephants, fireflies...) was gorgeous and exciting. Kalani, a lost wolf and her spirit companion want to discover the truth about her past and find the City of Light. Throughout their journey, as they learn more and more about Kalani, they are faced with many obstacles and their friendship is put to the test. Lost Ember is a beautiful game about compassion, forgiveness and love. ❤️"

An absolute tearjerker.
You know this is an amazing story and game when it pulls at your heart strings.
I purchased this game for my best friend as an early Christmas gift, only to have her tell me that I NEEDED to play it.
So, I did. And let me say how much I cried. A LOT.
The graphics of the game are absolutely beautiful and stunning. The story grabs your attention and plays with your emotions.
If I were you, I would get this game. You wont regret it."

8/1/2020 EDIT: After the recent Minimalist mode, I've decided to revisit this review.

This is the most engagement I've ever gotten from a Steam Review. And it was me dunking on an incredibly talented team of creators. It sucks knowing that my highest creative achievement has actively held back purchases, and thus just compensation, to actual artists. With all that said, I want to see future games from Mooneye Studios. I want to respect their creative achievement with a fair review, rather than with apathy.

I replayed through some of the game with minimalist mode on. This mode removes all the dialogue from your glowing ball companion. I forgot how gorgeous the game is. I don't know if the visuals were tweaked, but many scenes were absolutely breathtaking to behold.

Minimalist mode resulted in many small scenes becoming 10/10, slam dunk, homeruns, of environment storytelling and immersion. Like in Chapter 2, memories appear around you, you turn a corner and see many empty shelves and forlorn people. You naturally empathize with the people in that memory. The cut in dialogue feels natural in scenes like this.

The problem is that each one of those immersive moments is sandwiched between animated cutscenes that still have dialogue (the ones I saw could've had dialogue removed with this mode and no narrative lost), and in-engine cutscenes where the Wolf and glowing ball stare at eachother in silence for way too long. It's always awkward.

Does Minimalist mode improve the overall experience? Yes.
Would I have an easier time recommending the game now? Yes.
Do I recommend the game now? No.

Minimalist mode is a bandaid over a wound. It's obvious the game was made with dialogue in-mind. And I would never expect an Indie Team to take on the massive task of editing nearly every cutscene in the game to make it work. Plus it does nothing for the sense of quiet discovery when this mode isn't the default, or even the fact that your access to the dialogue is with simple slider. It's like revealing all the mysteries of the ""Shinning"" by turning on the Kubrick Commentary Track. It loses the magic.

My previous review mostly stands. If you're on the fence, I recommend buying the game on sale, Minimalist Mode on and with my recommendations from the old review active as well. It's worth experiencing until you get sick of it.

I hope Mooneye sees this: I wish you nothing but love and luck on you future endeavors.

----

Disclaimer: I received my copy from backing this on Kickstarter.

Lost Ember is an incredible success story. It is amazing what a small team can create with passion, dedication, and crowdfunding. The ""Very Positive"" score for this game is well deserved, but I can't recommend it.

For me it comes down to two things: It's not a game, and the writing pissed me off. The former is easy to explain. There are no challenges and no puzzles. The game was straight forward and linear. I would most generously describe it as an ""Interactive Movie"", when the game isn't in a cut-scene, that is. Who knows. Maybe collecting hundreds of mushrooms is what you consider a ""game"".

I could live with that, never caring enough to bother with a negative review. But the writing at the end was . Let me make this perfectly clear: Mooneye Studios made their lives harder than it had to be by incorporating voice acting into the game's story. Especially doing so in the most annoying way possible. Take a shot whenever the Navi ball of light guy points out the obvious. The ultimate loss is the art they could've created if they left the interpretation up to the player, instead of forcing it down your throat. See Ico, Journey, ect. Maybe then there could've been a point to collecting everything, as each piece could've unraveled the deeper plot.

Conclusion: The game is breathtaking, gorgeous, calming, has too many cutscenes that go on way too long, a story with a completely extraneous middle act, and voice acting that makes you sad for the loss of a deeply intimate experience and one that makes you ask yourself ""Wait, if the ball guy is supposed to be from this Myan/Mesopotamian era, why the hell does he have a chappy British accent?""

I don't regret my Kickstarter pledge, despite my objections. For the best experience, I recommend keeping the subtitles off, and switching the language to one you don't know."

Lost Ember is indubitably an extraordinarily beautiful game with vibrant worlds showcasing various different terrains, environments, and animals throughout its mesmerising, albeit short, playtime. Despite suffering from some clunky mechanics and glitchy sections, the premise of the game is simply captivating. It is indeed on the pricier end of the spectrum for such a small number of hours; thus, I suggest taking this into consideration before purchase, or waiting for a sale.

Pros
+ Vibrant, stunning, and picturesque visuals spanning across multiple biomes.
+ Atmospheric, poignant story.
+ Emotional soundtrack.
+ Various different animals to embody (with some questionable morphology and behavioural traits for some species)
+ Abundance of collectables
+ Steam trading cards and achievements.


- The English (UK) voice actor was slightly disappointing, especially in more passionate scenes where he sounded truly awkward and unable to express himself properly in higher pitches.
- Some areas were riddled with glitches, falling through the map and uncomfortable movements, especially with the mountain goat.
- Rather expensive ($AU 42.95) for 4-5 hours of the main storyline and with the above-mentioned issues.


Beginning in the form of a wolf, players are introduced to a red glowing orb who acts as the main narrator. The orb states that to get to the lustrous city of light (a highly sought-after resting place), they must work together. Guided by Yanren spirits and their customs, the two then begin their journey and descend further into the beautiful valleys, canyons and forests surrounded by stunning nature, slowly discovering the reasons behind their peculiar pairing.

The story is told mainly through red flashbacks and finding memories scattered throughout the chapters. I found the story itself to be surprisingly dramatic and meaningful, showcasing love, forgiveness, deceit and more. As a zoologist and animal lover in general, I was already overjoyed at the different animals and admittedly, the severity of the story at the beginning became slightly lost due to this. However, the flashbacks can be left open to interpretation and it is easy to lose sight of the plot, especially coupled with the periodically bizarre voice acting that retracted from the story.



There is also an option to remove the narration entirely which I know some players have chosen and is a good alternative for those just wishing to explore the beautiful landscapes. Towards the game’s conclusion, the height of the narrative became clear and it was emotional and immersive but ultimately did suffer from quick scene cuts or the over-dramatic voice acting.

Players begin as the enigmatic wolf but are also able to embody every living creature they come across including ducks (and ducklings), giant tortoises, sloths, wombats, fish and more. Each animal has varying walking speeds and skills which are needed to traverse the world and continue onwards to the City of Light. Roll down hills with wombats (I wish wombats could actually use this as a method of locomotion in reality), jump in and out of water as a fish, ram stone walls down as a bison and dig under the ground as an armadillo.

Gameplay is minimal, mainly consisting of exploring and running through the lush environments, finding collectables and traces of memories to piece the story together. Just exploring and enjoying the amazing visuals can account for hours by itself. There are no real puzzles or difficulty, even dive-bombing into the ground as a parrot is completely acceptable and thus it should be clear that Lost Ember is intended to be an immersive, exploration game where the beauty and nature is one of the primary purposes behind the title.


Unfortunately, I encountered a multitude of glitchy areas which severely impacted my immersion and with such a price point, should not be left unfixed or unmentioned. On almost every one of the 6 chapters, there was at least one section where I could fall through the map, or at least see the bare foundations of underneath it.

The inclusion of flying animals gives players the freedom to soar through the map, which I adored, however... it also becomes highly likely that players will fly to an area that we are not intended to be. Eventually getting stuck or as I experienced, accidentally finding myself way back at the beginning of a chapter after somehow flying through a small gap. Animals would consistently get stuck in walls, or at least, have their heads moulded inside solid objects, or once again, half in and half out of the map layout.
Flying was a bit awkward, but I got used to it, however the mountain goats jumping mechanics was awful and never seemed to register on the initial attempt at a jump. Lastly, the fall damage was extremely confusing. Sometimes, when jumping off a tiny ledge, I would immediately respawn, yet other times when I jumped off a huge cliff, it was perfectly fine. This was rather frustrating, yet almost amusing as to why I would respawn after jumping off a tiny step less than a metre high.

Overall, despite these bugs, the game as a whole is still stunning with gorgeous graphics, however it is a shame that such evident mishaps are still occurring frequently throughout the title.

After touching on this throughout my entire review, in my opinion, Lost Ember's strongest point, by an absolute landslide is its strikingly beautiful and unique art. Its inescapable grace and relaxing essence simply cannot be ignored. The bright, vibrant colours fill players' screens, accompanied by the many living beings residing in these fields make this a nature lovers paradise.



The soundtrack is also rather memorable and paired with the graphics, elicits emotion, and draws players into the story. Even with the slightly confusing narrative, I found that the soundtrack alone was enough to pique my interest and recapture my attention.








Lost Ember is a unique experience that truly captures the natural beauty of the outdoors. The innocence of the animals paired with the poignant story ultimately creates a game I will not easily forget. However, its steep price and buggy areas are something to take into consideration before purchase. Despite this, all in all, I greatly enjoyed my playthrough and will certainly be revisiting the game to revel in its beauty and spend more time as each of the creatures. Lost Ember is a must play and is indeed, an animal lovers utopia."

Original and breathtakingly beautiful. It’s a game that will play with your emotions and keep you hooked until the end.

Lost Ember

Pros:
👍Amazing Visuals and realistic animal movements
👍 A beautiful soundtrack and effects
👍Fun Achievements and Trading Cards

Cons:
👎 The regional voice acting seemed unsuitable for a fantasy world, so much that I turned it OFF.
👎 Story was open to interpretation and was a little confusing at times.

What an original and beautiful concept. This is probably my favourite game of the year.

From the very beginning I was amazed at how impressive the environments looked and how well the animals moved. Lost Ember is unashamedly embroiled in nature, and that is where its strengths lie. If you like a slower paced game then you will love this.

Possessing the animals and taking on their characteristics was hugely entertaining. Some of these animals had certain skills required to progress and some were there just for the fun. I’m talking about you Mr Sloth! Ultimately this game is a light puzzle, story rich, walking simulator with mild action sequences. It is perfect for a relaxing evening or two if you want to just follow the story or longer if you like to aim for achievements.

The environments were so beautiful that I couldn’t stop taking screen shots and each new animal I possessed brought about a smile at how realistic it was.

The soundtrack also deserves a special mention. It was hauntingly beautiful and sounded superb with headphones. It accompanied the story perfectly. The sound effects were notably impressive too.

The story, depicted through still images and narrated by the wolf’s companion, took second billing for me. The ambience and beauty of the surroundings and the musical score were the show stoppers in this game. This isn’t to say that the story was bad, it was just a little flat and was open to interpretation too much. The companion’s voice was terrible in my opinion. It was so bad that I actually turned the voice off. Why they decided a northern English voice was suitable for this game I will never know.

The story is quite short at roughly 5 hours but this can be extended to 10+ hours if you want to get all of the achievements.

The game is full of quality and extra special moments and one of the most original games I have played. It truly is a wonderful and mesmerizing experience.



Yanren spirits will go to the fabled city of light if they faithfully follow the customs and traditions expected. Anyone who is not deemed worthy of the pilgrimage will be tossed back to live as wild creatures.

This is where we start the story. A ball of light approaches a wolf and tells him that he believes that in order to transgress to the City of Light he must first help the wolf. Together they embark on an adventure of discovery and uncover the reasons why they have been put together.

The ball of light is the narrator and will comment, ask questions and relay the story to the gamer in voice. The wolf also acts as a narrator but in visual form. He will lead the ball of light to different locations, marked by a red smoking fire, and reveal his story through the medium of still pictures. Together they untangle the mystery and unravel the story.

The voice acting is bizarre. You don’t usually hear regional accents like this in a game. Coming from the UK myself I found this a very strange choice and for some reason it took away the magic of the story. I soon realized that I would need to mute the voice to take this game seriously and I found that I enjoyed the game much more without the voice.

The other medium of storytelling, the still pictures, also had its faults. It wasn’t always clear what was happening and was open to interpretation. At times I lost the plot and wondered what was going on. If you have played The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, then the story telling is similar with re-enactments of events played out in front of you. They looked amazing however and were very dramatic and beautifully drawn. Accompanied by the excellent soundtrack they created emotion and drama.

Personally, I didn’t think the story was the highlight of the game. I would recommend trying to play the game in one sitting along with headphones. I think that would help solidify the experience. I played through the game in about five sittings and this is why I found the story disjointed I think.



🕹️
Playing as a wolf you travel around the beautiful environments, with the ball of light, looking for campfires to progress the story. When you reach a fire, a reenactment of past events occurs and the ball of light comments and slowly the story is revealed.

You can transfer your soul and effectively become other animals. There are 15 animals to possess, some of these have special abilities that you will need to navigate around objects. For example, a small creature can move through tight spaces that the wolf cannot; Some animals can dig under walls or go underground; Larger animals can smash through patches of bamboo; Birds can fly across ravines; Fish can swim underwater and mountain goats can leap up sheer rock faces. There are other animals that have no purpose apart from the enjoyment of moving around in their body.

This adds light puzzle elements to the game as you will need to fathom how to get to different areas and to the next camp fire. The puzzles are quite easy. I wouldn’t say the game was completely linear as you can move around areas, but in the end the path will always lead you in the direction you need to go and present you with the animal you need to get through.
Sometimes you do get a little disorientated but there are helpful markers directing you down the right path.

Possessing the animals is so much fun and they are all incredibly well done. The movements are so realistic and they are a joy to navigate in.

The wolf can call upon his companion which will reveal hints or initiate commentary. The wolf can also use Focus which reveals nearby animals or story points.

Along with the story arc there are various achievements which will keep you very busy if you so wish. You can collect mushrooms where there are six different kinds and around 140 in total; you can collect 77 relics with descriptions; and six legendary animals to possess. After the game you can start from chapters to make it much easier to find these objects. The chapter shows how many relics, mushrooms and legendary animals you have left to find which is also very thoughtful for achievement hunters.

The story is around 5 hours in total if you ignore the achievements, but if you enjoy the achievements I would suggest there are 10+ hours to enjoy.

Incredibly beautiful sound tracks adorn the game and wrap around the story. Sound effects are wonderful too and make it all feel realistic, adding tension, drama and emotion in spades.

📺
Some of the nicest graphics I have seen. It really is amazingly beautiful. You will be taking a lot of screenshots.

The animal’s movement are so realistic and the game is full of wonderful moments like the way the animals swim or brush a flower sending the petals flying into the air. The snow blizzards were so realistic that it made me feel cold and I was desperate to get him to safety.

There are about seven areas to explore, all with a distinct feel and ambience.

A wonderful experience which I thoroughly enjoyed. It is incredibly rare to find a game so unique and beautiful.
I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a slower paced game and is particularly keen on walking simulators, or nature."

A very touching story about a father and daughter. The musical accompaniment in the game is excellent. The game provides an opportunity to understand a lot, and imbued with the life of the heroes. In principle, the entire game takes place not hastily, but with studying every bush. Since the game has many different things that can be found, as well as the beauty of the world, which does not allow to pass by. I am delighted with this game and recommend it for purchase."

Loving the game so far. The wombat creatures are super cute and the ducks are funny. The game play is straightforward which allows you to really enjoy the animals and surroundings. It's nice to play a non-threatening game at your own pace. Sound effects are nice too. Looking forward to playing more tonight and I would definitely recommend."

I don't like leaving negative reviews, and honestly, I did technically enjoy this game, but it has enough issues for me to strongly ward any prospective buyers off buying it full price. This game is, unfortunately, just not really worth the 30€.

Let's start off with the positives. It's a gorgeous game. The colors are lush, the environments breathtaking, if a little empty at times. This game shines in its graphics and let me tell you that I let out the most unholy shriek of joy when I first saw the wombats, that's just how adorable they are. They stylization of Wolf is also gorgeous, and every animal definitely feels like it has weight and presence in the world as you traverse it.

Unfortunately, said gorgeous landscapes are often obscured by the camera clipping straight into a wall, giving you a glimpse of the great yawning abyss rather than the stunning architecture reclaimed by nature. This issue is especially prevalent in narrow spaces, where the camera becomes your worst enemy.

This game lacks any sort of gameplay outside of ""move forward, find next story point"". Outside of moving forward, the only other gameplay is battling the camera and bizarre terrain constraints, as well as occasionally flying against an invisible wall for ages before realizing that there is, in fact, an invisible wall. The story points are ""cutscenes"" which show static figures for several seconds at a time, with meh-tier voice acting from the characters and your orb-y companion. The dialogue is sub-par, awkward, and exposition-heavy, but I suppose that can be blamed on the studio being German.

The story... oh boy the story. Weighed down heavily by afforementioned voice acting (particularly your companion pointing out the obvious with the most fake ""surprised"" tone you could possibly imagine), as well as cliché and predictable story beats. The most egregious choice here was adding in a twist for the sake of a twist that comes out of nowhere, and failing to actually flesh out any of the character dynamics outside of the main plot. I did not care about a single one of the characters, they all only existed to fill their role in the plot, and didn't have anything else going for them. They don't talk about anything outside of the plot or heavy-handed exposition about the culture.

That being said, I did enjoy the different animals, I just wish there was more of a challenge and utility to the different animals, perhaps puzzles, instead of fighting with poor level design of a game that is linear but tries to seem open-world. It is a walking sim. And I don't have a problem with walking sims, at all, it's just that the story and exploration needs to be good, and unfortunately, neither of them were particularly stellar

The collectables are also just a bit ridiculous in number (there are... so many....), though I did appreciate the little easter eggs.

I finished the game in about 4 hours across two sessions. It's a short game. Keep that in mind also. I don't think I could sit through the game again, even for collectables, so there's not really any replay value either. The story is linear, the levels are mostly linear. There's no extra story. No secret areas. Just collectibles, and the main story.

I got the game, among others, for 11€ in a Humble Bundle. I would recommend getting this game at half price or lower (10-15€), no more.

TLDR: don't get this game full price, it's not a bad game per se, it's just also not a GOOD game either."

Recommended- with caveats.

The game has fantastic visuals. The environments are stunning.
However, at the time of this review, there are some significant bugs, such as clipping into terrain, possibly getting stuck in/on geometry if you morph back into the wolf at the wrong time or place, animals, plants, rocks, and other things floating above the surface (levitating when they should not be). Some random UE4 engine crashes, unknown what is causing them, no way to predict them.

An earlier bug that left the game running after you exited has been patched by the devs, but it means my total hours played is not accurate. (I bought the game on Launch Day, while the bug was still occurring). I estimate my actual playtime to be about 5-8 hours less than what is shown on this review.

All that said, I did truly enjoy the game. (And I will go back in to get the last achievements, after waiting for the devs to hotfix a few of the bugs that are more gamebreaking.)

The graphics are stunning. The world is very beautiful to look at, stunning landscapes, ruins, and building interiors. It is a feast for the eyes. Except the Legendary Animals... the bright glowing ultra-white color of them made them a bit painful to look at on the screen.
The music is wonderful. Really wonderful.
The voice acting is superb. (At least in English it is.)
The story is rich, and deep, and yes, political. It is a story of love, betrayal, joy, heavily tempered by loss and pain. The story is the main draw for this game. Kudos to the writer(s) who touched my heart so deeply with the narrative. The environmental story-telling, if you take your time and look at the world, and the things around you only adds to the depth and richness.
The animal models are fantastic. Cute and heck Wombats, different birds that look and fly like birds should, the wolf, with it's palpable expressions and emotion-filled eyes. The Little Silly Things each animal can do gave me a chance to breathe, and just have fun with them. Well done.
Sound design is very good. The different sounds of the wolf's pawsteps on snow, sand, dirt, stone. The ambient sounds from each environment... wonderfully done. The sounds each animal makes are real, and varied.
Some good Accessibility options, though more could be done. (Open Dyslexic font for subtitles... wonderful! No background behind the subtitles, not so wonderful. No option to resize the font, though it is reasonable for most without vision issues. However the white for with a black border gets lost on the white fade out screens and some lighter or brighter colored landscapes. ) For Deaf or HoH players, the subtitles will allow you to play the game, I noticed no missing dialogues in the subtitles, and no odd translations that made no sense. They stay on the screen for a good amount of time so you can read them slowly, however clicking the screen while they are up will make them disappear or move forward to the next line, with no way to go back and see what you may have missed.
The scavenger hunt for collectibles will either delight you (some are very well hidden,and require a good bit of exploration), or will feel grindy. I enjoyed it, YMMV.

Controls are a bit clunky on kb/m. The game plays much better with a controller. No key rebinds for kb/m, though the devs say they are hoping to add key rebindings in the future. There is a lot of mouse clicking, and keypresses... a tad tough on my arthritic hands, but not terrible. YMMV. Controller made it much easier on my hands, but still, not as good as it could be. Frame rate is capped at 60 fps, no support for GSync monitors (1440p/144 fps). Devs say they will try to add that in the future as well. But it was a consistent 60 fps, with no stutters, hitching or spiking on my system.

This is an Unreal Engine 4 game. It will heat your GPU up.
I played on:
Windows 10 Home 64 Bit
i9 9900K @ 3.6 GHz (no OC)
NVIDIA 2060 RTX Super
16 GB DDR4 RAM
GPU ran at ~70-75°C, regardless of graphics settings, only a drop of a few °C between Low and Ultra, both fans ran at ~50%, slightly higher in ""busier"" areas.
CPU never went past 40°C, but that is with a custom liquid cooling system, mobo and PSU stayed around the same temps (Custom cooled system, again).
No overheats on my system, but if you are playing at the low end of the minimum/recommended spec, keep an eye on temps, and adjust your setting down as needed.

The game needs more optimization, it is clearly optimized for PS4 and XBox One, and not so well set up for PC. Yet. Very new, young and small dev team, who obviously put a ton of love into the game, and who seems to be determined to fix bugs as well and as quickly as they can.

If you are unsure, the game does not seem like it is going anywhere, and will only get better as bugs are addressed and fixed. Wait, if you are looking for a first game from a small independent studio, releasing their very first (very ambitious) game. Personally, I felt it was worth full price on launch day (10% Launch Day discount). I still feel it is worth full price, in spite of the bugs it still has. I am very hopeful the devs are doing their best to tackle bugs, and add some things players have requested. Not sure? Wait a bit, and see how things go. It's not a Beta, but it does have an Early Access feel to it at the time of this review. I will return and update this review if I see improvements, or notice a lack of any, as time goes on. I understand how complex the game is, and how small the dev team is, so I expect it will take some time for them to fix all of the bugs.

Good. You made it to the end. Have a berry. Have a bunch.

12/20/2019) devs released a patch that fixed some issues with achievements counters not working correctly, and hotfixed a few other issues. I'll be playing again soon, to go for the 100% completion of the game.)"

A little gem for animal lovers and not only. The story, despite being slightly predictable, is well written and emotional. The trip itself is so gorgeous, and the places you visit so outwordly and magical! Maybe it's a bit short, take it as a dream to live in one session if you can :)

My god, what a wonderful game, with a touching story it is one of the most beautiful games I had the pleasure of playing.

In a world where there is so much violence and so much evil it is these games that I need to play.

I recommend it to adults, because young people today will not be able to feel the message that this game has to offer.

The quality of the story is so good that it doesn't matter if the game has any type of bug or not.

I highly recommend it."

its......hard to give this a honest review. It wasnt really a game, but it was more so like a very interactive movie. it had nice little mechanics with the animals, but there was hardly any suspension(only like 3 times when you had a sense of urgency).


the story wasnt all that great at the first half, very repetitive, nothing much going on. but roughly around chapter 4 is when things actually started getting interesting, and emotional. animals became slightly more diverse, and the environment became more diverse too, and the story itself started to get dramatic.

But....the game itself felt.....rushed....there were environments that didnt even have collision boxes, camera was very wonky, and there were times where i soft-locked myself on multiple occassions to where i had to restart at the last checkpoint. This story is good on the second half of it. but the first half was kind of boring and repetitive, environemnt seemed rushed, and i could tell there wasnt much tests for bugs or glitches, since there were many parts of the enivronment you can easily clip through or just flat out got soft locked.


Is this game worth $30? no. Is the Enviornment and story good? to an extent sort of but only towards the ending. It is a very short game tho, only 5 hours long. If you love story focused games, its got a nice story. But if you're looking more adventure/suspense than anything, its not the game for it. its pure story.

Honest answer, i'd give it 6.7/10."

Only one thing to say — the studio needs better level designers.

Lost Ember would benefit greatly if the locations were smaller and more dense detail-wise. There's absolutely no need to have so much space that is not inviting for the player to explore. It doesn't express much itself and doesn't contribute to the story; it only ever adds up the feeling of emptiness. The only motivator to keep lurking around is the collectibles, but they are so randomly placed, it is easier to take a day and vacuum-clean the locations with YouTube guide videos.

Other than that, I'm really on the fence whether I could recommend this game or not. This project is not, however, bad; the team just need more experience and better direction for their future projects, so I'll give them a pass."

Lost Ember is truly a masterpiece with beautifully crafted environments, stylized creature designs, fantastic soundtrack and an emotional story. The story is visually told through the journey you go on as a wolf and your interaction with your orb friend. Along your adventure you will encounter 19 different animals that you can take control over to use their unique characteristics to get around obstacles and to proceed further along. The movement of each animal feels fluid and is highly fun to swim, run and fly through enormous levels that are built for an ecosystem. There are tons (236 to be precise) of collectibles hidden throughout the world that extends the game-play greatly including a chapter select option to go back if your missing any. It took me over ten hours to complete the game but that includes me stopping and taking in the mesmerizing habitats. Overall, the game is very relaxing with soothing music and beautiful art style. Highly recommended [100/10]"

This game has decent assets, style, mechanics, and story, but combines them in a way that is barely even a game. The game has an incredibly linear flow, the player moves through the map and story constantly going forward and never returning to a space. The player is also given no incentive to explore the areas and any attempt at creative problem solving is met with heavy handed coercion back onto the main path.
This mainly takes the form of egregious invisible walls and very limited animal capabilities. There are many places throughout the map where traversal should be possible but the games creators forbid it. All interesting sequences from the trailer are essentially push-button events and there are sequences where all you need to do is spam space bar to keep things running. The linear map, reused assets, and excessive use of fog give the impression that the art team did not have the resources to make a satisfactory scale map.

The game had a number of technical issues, especially with the camera.
The over the shoulder camera feels clumsy and the default sensitivity is too low.
It is easy for the camera to clip through walls, especially whenever you enter a tunnel as a bird.
I encountered a fatal error in the first mountain goat section and the game ran very poorly on my laptop, where it did not even render correctly (the wolf was poorly textured and missing eyes)

If you play this game, follow the linear guides rigidly and keep your hands and feet inside the vehicle at all times. Any attempt to deviate will be unsatisfying and you are best off rapidly pushing through the story and enjoying the silly sequences (e.g. fish slide) as they come."

Lost Ember is a unique gaming experience and a must-have for all animal lovers. I became so totally immersed in this game that I played into the wee hours of the morning one night! Lost Ember is one of those games where you take your time and explore the environment to find relics and a variety of mushroom collectables.
The big adventure was to be morphed into the various animals around you from the slow sloth and giant tortoise to a mole or hummingbird. There were 6 legendary animals to possess, but I somehow missed them completely!!
The environment ranged from beautiful undulating hills, to a dust storm in a desert, snow high in the mountains or swimming down a raging river. It was so magical and such fun....and delights the child within us all.
The back story of an ancient culture was fascinating. You become emotionally invested in its story of rebellion, revenge and redemption. I guessed the ending, so wasn't surprised.
The graphics are stunning at times. Music was really good....loved that gentle piano at emotional moments. Controlling the animals could be a bit clunky, but nothing was impossible. At times, I got caught in rocks with my head stuck in it or morphed into the wolf at the wrong time, but going back to the last checkpoint was the best solution.
Quite expensive for the hours of play, but is replayable to get all the achievements and collectables. Not a perfect game, but getting better with each update. I was amazed to see the thousands of kickstarters in the credits. Highly recommend. 8.5/10"

I´ve won this game 2 or 3 years ago at the Gamescom - did not hear anything about it before but was look forward for it since then.
Overall you should not expect too much action or puzzles in this game but a lot of atmospheric story telling and an interesting journey.
Graphics are pretty nice in their own way.

I do recommend this game for the beautiful art work in the game, and the well written story.
But for how much play time you get to finishing the story... the price cuts a little deep. However there is a lot you can do- as long as you take your time looking around.

It was really hard to choose whether to recommend or to not recommend. I would say don't buy this if you don't have money to spare.
When I first saw this game I thought you would play as this red orb and you went around, becoming different animals while also exploring this world. There would be ruins, old civilizations ect. as well.

But, no. Instead, the ENTIRE game revolves around this short story that can be completed in 4 hours or less. Don't get me wrong, the story is amazing, the art is breath-taking and the music is beautiful, but this is not what was advertised. I was not expecting a movie, but a game where you could roam free."

I just finished the game, so I can finally say with absolute certainty that this game is beautiful in every way. The storytelling, the gameplay, the visuals, all of it. I would recommend it to anyone who can appreciate a good, wholesome, emotionally charged story with scenic views all around.

On a more specific note, If you've played Abzu, it is similar in terms of being a halfway linear and artistically excelling game but with a heavier emphasis on story and world-building. There are surprisingly many animals in the game, each with mechanics that function quite well and fit into both the story and theme. Play this game, you won't regret it."

Story - 9/10 would be 10/10 but story is shorter then I would like because it was good
Art and Design - 10.10 Amazing
Gameplay - 8/10
Performance - 10/10

I can't even begin to explain how beautiful this game is.
Just finished the story and it's unbelievable.

The story had me thrilled. it was a beautiful story that developed nicely in my opinion and had a lovely ending. I'd give the story an 9/10. Why? Because for as great of game this is... the story is fairly short. easily completable in a day or weekend no problem. Don't get me wrong, I DEFINITELY think one should get this game and I think the price is about right for what you get although others may have different opinions on that so if you feel the story is to short for the price then wait for a sale but do eventually grab it.

the art and design are amazing. especially the world around you. it's so beautiful and the soundtrack to go with it is perfect. everything just kinda flows nicely and everything looks beautiful. 10/10

Gameplay is... definitely not bad... but nothing revolutionary or anything. it's a pure story driven game, casual game. there's no fighting or enemies or anything like that and falling off a ledge just spawns you back up where you were, it's understandable in a way though as more resources were spent in other places to make them stellar and it shows. 8/10. Why? camera movement isn't perfect. it's 100% playable with little problems. I played with a controller so that may also make a difference too but the camera can get a bit wonky at times. quick clip threw a wall or something like that, nothing big, and some animals you control are a bit wonky to control as well. nothing serious or anything but I wouldn't mind if a bit more time was spent in that department, however, not all animals are like that. in fact, most control just fine, it's just occasionally an animal seems a bit off or something. the hummingbird for example, not bad but the overall movement of the hummingbird could have been better or tweaked.

Performance is borderline perfect. the desert area gave me some dips in fps but nothing bad or problematic. I'm running older hardware (970 and i5-4670k) and had 0 problem running at max settings 1080p 60fps (though I didn't keep track of the fps but it felt very smooth so...) 10/10 confident that this game could run on a potato,maybe an overclocked potato.

I backed this game on kickstarter like 3 years ago just cause it looked neat and might be fun but I never expected it to be this good and amazing. I would buy this game for myself 3 times over just to have it on every platform I play on and grab a copy for every friend just so they could play it too if I could.

A solid 10/10 despite it's shortcomings."

«Review(En):»
It is a masterpiece! This touching story about a lost soul and will not leave anyone indifferent.
It gave us a lot to think about, since chapters cover the events not only the personal tragedies of the main characters, but also provide an example of how arrogance, exclusion, arbitrariness and neglect by Government can drive peaceful peoples to revolution, despair and violence.

Great graphics, lots of details, decent design and animation, nice music and voice acting, the enchanting atmosphere of the beautiful nature and many cute animals, birds and fish, in whose bodies we follow the path in the City of Light.

The gameplay is simple and relaxing, reminiscent of walking simulators, but there are moments with finding a way, solving puzzles and quickly pressing buttons + there are many different collectibles (not so easy to find).


Шедевр, в который могут сыграть как взрослые, так и дети. Эта трогательная история о заблудшей душе не оставит никого равнодушным и дает огромную почву для размышлений, поскольку события охватывают не только личные трагедии главных героев, а показывает пример того, как можно довести народ до революции.

Великолепная графика, множество деталей, достойная анимация, приятная музыка, качественная озвучка, чарующая атмосфера природы и множество милых зверей, птиц и рыб, в телах которых мы проходим путь в царство света.

Геймплей простой и расслабляющий, напоминает симуляторы ходьбы, но есть моменты с поиском проходов, разгадыванием загадок и быстрым нажиманием кнопок + в игре полно разнообразных предметов коллекционирования, которые можно собрать, но не так легко отыскать.

Lost Ember is an emotional journey of discovery, following two lost souls through a lush and vibrant world.

The world of Lost Ember is brimming with life. The intriguing part is, you're not limited to experience it from the protaganist's eyes. You're able to transport yourself through the souls of various animals to manipulate and view the world through their eyes. From becoming a fish to explore below the water's surface, or perhaps a hummingbird to fly up high and view the canopies of forests and jungles, there is an abundance to see and explore. All the while, you are catching glimpses of your past through memories. Various cutscenes, 3D as well as 2D and narrative, help you unravel your story and an ancient civilization as you progress through each chapter.

+ Beautifully vibrant, lively art style.
+ Numerous breathtaking views of the landscape, literally making you say ""whoa"" out loud.
+ Superb environmental audio, bringing the exotic world to life around you.
+ Voice acting is appropriate. You can feel the emotion the dev is trying to convey.
+ The music is top notch and fits perfectly. Very calming.
+ Plenty of collectibles and little things to find while exploring.
+ The story and direction is very linear, but with my above point you still feel a sense of exploration and discovery.
+ Filled with little details that bring the world to life. Running through dandelions cause them to scatter into the wind. Traversing through snow leaves a path behind you. You can see the love that went into creating this world.
+ Be prepared for a box of tissues.

- Camera is not sensitive enough, not even when pumped up to 100% sensitivity. It feels like it can't keep up with your movement, so I'm constantly arcing my mouse multiple times in the direction I want to go. By the end of my play through, my wrist was a bit sore.
- Stuttering when loading. Game will freeze up in certain areas to the point I thought it had crashed.
- Camera clips through walls which breaks the immersion.
- Fell through the map in spots during Chapter 2. Invisible walls missing?
- Music fades in and out in weird spots, rapidly.
- After Chapter 3, I ran into a few fatal errors.




Despite a lot of bugs which are easily fixable in a future update, I wholeheartedly recommend this game. It is a charming adventure of self discovery and coming to terms with your past, filled with lots of little secrets and easter eggs."

+Story, story, story!
+Graphics, breathtaking

+Music and Sound

This game involves exploration, walking, flying, swimming; It is pure eye-candy and has a great story.

This game is ultimately about forgiveness. In order to have forgiveness something had to have transpired that requires it. Your job is to find out what happened long ago.

To do this you travel back in time assuming the bodies of different animals along the way. Some animals are better suited than others in the environment you are in. You will always have an animal you need to get through that chapter.

Regardless of the world or creature you are it is an amazing experience. You soar as an eagle, swim like a trout, scale mountains as a mountain goat. I do not know the exact number of mammals, birds, etc. you can play. Perhaps 30?

The music and sounds are perfect. You hear the slosh of water as you walk through it, the rustle of bamboo as you walk through.

There is an auto-save function that works quite well. If you jump off a cliff (like me, many times) you have an instant retry.

My game length was a whopping 25 hours. At least ten of these hours were spent goofing off, enjoying the animals and exploring the nooks and crannies. I were in no rush to finish the game; I savored it.

There are 77 relics you can collect, six legendary animals, and approximately 100 mushrooms.

There is a chapter option that will tell you what you missed if you want to go back and collect them. Thank you!

There is very little violence, what violence there is, is not graphic. This is a family friendly game.

There are few games that will entertain a teen through senior; Lost Ember is one of those games."

One of the most beautiful games i have ever played, such an immersive storyline, you get to take form of many many different animals, other than your main character. The music is just right with every memory renactment. So emotional too, 100% recommending it, i cried of how beautiful it is."

At first I have to say, it is one of the most beautiful game I have ever played. And I also have to add this: The story of this amazing game would melt the heart of the biggest badass in the world, certainly.

Story:

Lost Ember is about the love, forgiveness and about hope. The wolf is led with the light - her tiny friend on the way back to the City of Light. Their stories have a common past and their future you can find with them. It is lovely in every possible way.

I was always pleased with something new, which I found in next chapter. I could explore wide variety of land types or see the game world from different perspective, from the eyes of different animals. And, for example, I had a great opportunity to be turtle (they have really tough life, I understand it now).

I like games with intense storytelling, so if you like this type of a game, Lost Ember is for you too.

:

It was the feature I really enjoyed during the game. There was a perfect harmony. The music was relaxing and soothing. With the story and graphics they gave me the strong experience and it was worth it - money, tears (I am not kidding) and time i spent with Lost Ember.

:

5 the most important pros:
+
+
+ graphics
+ the main character - animal
+ different kind of animals you can play with

2 the most important cons (for me), i have not found any other till now:
- the game has lots of bugs, unfortunatelly, but the general impression was more relevant than this mistake
- the game was too short, overall

9/10 Recommend it.

I am looking forward to another such a breathtaking game as Lost Ember is."

This is the most stunning game I have played in quite a while. Design and music are beautiful, and you can see how much work the dev team has put into this. I started playing when the closed beta was out and played again several times after the official release.
The story is sad and heartwarming at the same time, for we follow a wolf and a spirit through a world were mankind is no more (a quite recennt event as it seems). The spirit was denied access to the city of light after death, and he's convinced the wolf has once been human, too, but done thinngs bad enough to let her be reborn as a ""lost ember"" and thus a beast. So the spirit is determined to get to know what the wolf had done in order to get her and himself access to the city of light.
I won't say anything else about that quest in order to let you experience that journey yourself, but I love how the wolf and the spirit step by step uncover bits and pieces of the past in order to make sense of the greater picture and find out what injustice has been done.
You walk around as the wolf, always accompanied by your spirit guide. In order to complete this journey, you get the ability to take over different animals and travel around in their shape. This allows you to get to places and do things you'd never be able to as a wolf.

At the beginning of the game, the spirit has no clue about who he was before his death. About halfway through the game, I had an idea who he might have been, but it took quite a while until I got to know if I was right or not - and I liked that, for it made me pay very close attention to all those little hints that I might find.

From the beta until now, I have seen the game being improved and the community being heard and answered. At this point, I only found very few minor bugs left in the game, small enough so they don't stop me from enjoying this game so much.

Since the release, I have played the game several times, and I still can't stop myself from crying at two parts throughout the game. The music really adds to the amazing story, and combined with the beautiful design, this is an amazing game. I can only recommend y'all to go play it and experience it yourself!"

Lost Ember is a (mostly) wordless narrative that pushes you to explore sun-soaked ruins in a lush, vibrant world that doubles as an apotheosis for your voiceless protagonist, a wolf traversing a strange, mystical environment while exploring its backstory through a myriad of frozen memories spread across the land.

I saw this stuff before in the Lion King... where it ended badly. 
A Screenshot of Lost Ember
By: Zuluf


Initially developed as a Kickstarter Project back in 2016, this indie title was recently re-released as a VR title for Steam and offers about 3 hours of gametime for a playthrough, possibly a few more if you’re keen on collecting all the mushrooms and relics hidden in every nook and cranny. Before we even start picking this thing apart, you ought to know there are absolutely no fights, puzzles or challenges between you and the ending cinematic. Lost Ember is primarily an immersive exploration experience and while it does provide a gimmick (which we will explore in detail further down below), the game simply isn’t about overcoming difficulty as much as it is about enjoying a fairly straightforward traversal of a diverse, sprawling world and enjoying its (mostly) visual narrative. To that end, I would recommend that you choose the minimalistic mode when prompted at the start of the campaign, as you will get a much more hands-on delivery of the story and may enjoy the mystery a lot more if you’re trying to figure it out from the imagery alone.

The elegant visual style is impressive by any standard - vibrant textures and gradients bless every surface and bloom effects come in no small dose from the first few minutes of gameplay. You control a wolf but can also possess most other creatures you encounter - flyers such as parrots or insects will enable you to dive from untold heights and enjoy breathtaking vistas, and small underwater cracks hinder your progress until you dive through them while mind controlling fish of various shapes and sizes. Controlling moles will allow you to dig tunnels under rock formations and jumping into mountain goats (my personal favorites) will give you the ability to climb great heights and traverse steep surfaces like it ain’t no thang. Which is great, because the natural winding paths, the mood transitions from vast deserts to towering mountain ranges, I would say, make up about half the eye candy this game is famous for, transcending its modest indie budget.
The other half are the ruins of the Yanren civilization - heavily inspired by the Inca. Like their real-life inspiration, the Yanren have built an ornate and elaborate chain of settlements, culminating in a giant, majestic hub they named Quilotasi, a citadel built on a mountaintop, indicative of a very deliberate and inspired shout-out to Machu Picchu.



Accompanying you is a wisp, commenting on your actions and providing a sort of translation for the things you see, but I found him kind of convention-breaking and mildly annoying. While your fates are bound and he is essential to the story and specifically to your character’s quest, I was so immersed in the aesthetic and non-verbal communication that makes up the majority of the game that a histrionic ball of light with a british accent felt somewhat out of place and distracting. Which is why I’d like to resubmit my earlier suggestion that you choose minimalism when starting the game, which will probably spare you his flavorless droning.
While there are a few bottleneck moments and maybe a handful of quick-time events between start and finish, for the majority of the playtime you’ll be running along a pretty obvious path and occasionally jumping into different animals for specific obstacles. Your inability to die (you just instantly respawn on the last safe spot if you fall off into the void) and the intuitive level design mostly guide you towards progression. Really, the only reason you would even stray off the path is to collect mushrooms or relics if you’re a completionist, but for the most part you’ll be pushing forward at a steady pace, motivated by the distressing memories uncovering what seems, at first, to be the sunset of an entire civilisation.

Every few minutes you get greeted by beauty - whether it’s a blood-red sunset as you transition between biomes, a pandemonium of parrots flanking your extraordinary flight through waterfalls or downriver slides ending in upward ramps throwing you violently into translucent lagoons. The color palettes are gorgeous and infuse the world with a kind of dreamlike filter. Throughout your journey, your come across memories releasing red smoke, through which you discover the fate of the Yanren civilisation, whose ruins adorn the twisting path you need to follow in order to reach your ultimate goal, The City of Light.

Without revealing too much of the story, I encourage you to seek out and uncover all of the memories - the majority of them you’ll uncover naturally, through the storyline’s progression, but in order for everything to make sense and figure out who plays exactly what role, you’re going to need all the puzzle pieces. As Kalani, the reincarnation of a Yanren as a sleek, blue eyed wolf, you will reconstruct not only the sequence of events that brought you here, but the roles and importances of all the other characters, who through their hubris, ignorance and impulsiveness set the stage for the bittersweet denouement you’re galloping towards.



The instrumental part of the soundtrack is fitting - string instruments and gentle piano licks paint an emotional and heartfelt backdrop for the whole experience, but it could have been so much more. Instead of having used the inevitable indie pop vocals that did absolutely nothing for the worldbuilding and consistency, the devs would have enriched their considerable worldbuilding efforts had they developed sounds and themes for the Yanren, adding a dimension of sound to what I perceive to be a fundamental pillar of the game’s lore. There’s a plethora of instruments they could have used, as the 15th century civilisations they drew visual inspiration from used very exotic and unique-sounding blowing and percussion instruments we can easily emulate nowadays. It just seems as a missed opportunity that would have further extended the appeal of an already vivid universe that doesn’t need hacky lyrics and talking wisp sidekicks to be profound or elaborate.

That said, it’s ultimately your decision how much you want to churn out for Lost Ember, as depending on what you appreciate in your entertainment, your enjoyment will vary dramatically. Its lean, careful aesthetics are backed up by a gripping and emotional story that, while brief, is best consumed not as a video game in the traditional sense of the word, but rather a journey through a vivid ecosystem, populated by the ghosts of long-forgotten peoples."

I was really looking forward to this game, but it's just not what I expected

From the promotional material I was expecting a beautiful, polished game with seamless shapeshifting between forms, and heavy focus on making movement flow and feel good for the player. I was thinking the gameplay would probably be focused around exploring, and finding hidden things only accessible with certain forms, and I wasn't completely off but..

The first thing I was met with was of course a cut scene introduction into the game, but I was surprised to find it came with voice acting, that unfortunately feels really out off place.
When I got into gameplay the first thing I noticed was the animation. There is no turning animation, if you stand still and turn around all that happens is the avatars position is rotated, it doesn't move. When you walk and then stop the avatar just stops frozen mid frame, with no transition to an idle animation and it looks really awkward. I then tried sprinting and found it a little clunky feeling, with the speed of the sprint varying greatly even on flat ground. And then the jump.. it just feels bad, and you hardly move off of the ground, it would have been better had they left it out. When the ""shapeshifting"" was introduced I was disappointed to find it wasn't shapeshifting at all, but possession of the animals around you.

After playing for a while it dawns on me that there really isn't any gameplay other than movement in different animal forms, which I would have been fine with had the movement felt good. They do have different collectibles scattered about that you can find by exploring the areas, and a narrative which I see many other people enjoying. Myself, I found it a little bland and maybe a tad unoriginal.

As it stands it isn't a bad game, just different from what i expected. But I will be refunding the game, but maybe pick it up again at a sale, at a more reasonable price tag. 30€ is a high price for what this game currently is."

Lost Ember is a game that I really wanted to like. I enjoy walking simulators and exploring. I enjoy story-based games. I'm a big indie game fan. However, this game did not leave me feeling satisfied.

PROS
* Major shout out to the voice actors. They did a phenomenal job with their lines and really tried to sell their characters.
* The atmosphere was overall positive: each chapter gave a good feel to the different areas, giving you a sense of belonging, loneliness, nature, or the elements (depending on the chapter). The graphics did a great job with this.
* Wolf. My old black lab I grew up with died a few months before I played this game. Just controlling Wolf, who looks a lot like my dog, and running around as her made me break down and cry a few times. Thank you for this, Mooneye.
* Controlling other animals can be quite fun, especially flying around.


CONS
* The world, while usually having a great atmosphere, just felt... empty. Exploration games should give you not only cool places to explore, but should give you things to do in them. Compare Lost Ember to some of my other favorite exploration games: Firewatch, What Remains of Edith Finch, Tacoma. Each of these games give you reasons to poke around and explore every nook and cranny. You can find puzzles, riddles, neat things that enhance the story, details of the world, and easter eggs. While the ideas of those things exist in Lost Ember, they're weak at best. The only puzzles in Lost Ember are taking control of animals, pressing X to do the animal's specialty, and moving on. The only things to find are collectibles which add minuscule detail to the world. It feels more like a collect-a-thon slog instead of things exciting and new to find.
* The gameplay is, quite frankly, boring. I nodded off several times while pressing forward, which is 70% of the gameplay. Don't get me wrong, I like walking simulators quite a lot; it's a great way to tell a story as a genre, but in this game the story pieces were at breaks, effectively little campfires that you stop at. The non-story parts were just pressing forward.
* The story. Minor spoiler: Major spoiler:
* This is super minor, but annoyed me: the camera can clip through the ground. It makes running down slopes awkward and breaks the immersion the game tries to sustain.


In the end, I can't really recommend the game. If you get it on a really good sale, I suppose it might be worth it. Otherwise it's just too empty and stretched out. It's a weird, forced way to tell a flawed story."
lost+ember,Not Recommended,5.6,"Posted: May 30, 2020
No but yes, allow me to explain.
This is a beautiful game whose trailer makes you think it will be a similar experience to Journey, THIS IS NOT JOURNEY, thought there are a few similarities. I can only recommend this game if you find it on sale for less than 20$, this is not worth the 30 they ask for it.

The visuals are absolutely stunning but uncanny at times, it is beautifully stylized however there are plenty of things that are questionable and after awhile you will notice that they wasted time in so many pointless little things that they could have spent in making the main played animals much better.

Right at the start the game caught me off guard with a fully voiced acted narrator, this game did NOT need voice acting much less a narrator, that is one of the beauties of Journey that the story is told completely by the visuals and music and therefor left to interpretation of the player, THIS IS NOT THE CASE HERE. Countless times, specially at the beginning, you will be constantly interrupted by the narrator, and the music in game is just... weak, it's almost like elevator music, it doesn't represent the scenes at all, and this is when there is music, and where there is music it keeps fading in and out for some strange reason. I truly believe that the best scenes in this game are the ones that are not voice acted.

As for the story, it's fine. It starts of so slow though, I can see why people say the story is boring, cause in all honesty for the first 3 hours of the game, it is very much boring. It eventually picks up but exactly cause the game lets you interpret it first before narrating over your thoughts. Sorry but this narrator really didn't work for me... You can turn it off but if it's there I believe the developers meant for the game to be played with the narrator.

And lastly, be prepared for bugs, specially if you like to stick your nose in every corner of the maps. I got soft locked 3 times in my 6 hour play through, with no way out but to reload a previous safe file. This game needed more polish.

To sum it up, this is a case where less could have been more, no narrator, stronger sound track, polish on the art and game play testing departments and I believe this game could be side by side with Journey and others games of the kind.

It is a strong 6/10 from me."

Pros

- Very pretty and soothing game to explore and collect stuff. Most of my time went just while gaping around and taking screenshots of everything.
- Love the art style, and especially the wolf. Huge droopy ears and miserable expression = instant bawling.
- The story is well-told, very important and something you don't see often especially in video games.
- Huge cryfest warning at the end. Bring tissues.

Cons

- Some minor graphic bugs.
- Toggle would've been more comfy. As Wolf you have to push shift to run. As a bird or fish you gotta mash space bar. My poor pinky finger and space.
- Grabbed this one from sale for 12€. Worth the money, but considering I took 6 hours to beat it and I wasn't even rushing, I'd say full price (30€) is too much for such a short game.

Judgement

Must buy if you like beautiful, zen, exploration and story oriented games!"

I think it was a beautiful game with a great story! Don't expect an action or puzzle game, it's definitely more of a walking simulator, but definitely the best I've played!

PROS

- the world is beautiful and more diverse than I thought! It's not all green forest, let's put it that way
- great story! I really felt a connection to the characters and was close to tears on multiple points of the story
- lots of different animals to play. This is probably the main thing of the game and it really makes exploring the world as different animals pretty fun and interesting
- huge world to explore

CONS

- no real challenge. You basically explore the world and find hidden areas and fun little extras until you're satisfied and go on with the story. But for me this was always fun and never boring or frustrating
- sometimes you don't really know where to go. This happened on a few occasions, but never lasted for too long. One time I restarted the checkpoint to get back to the main path. Luckily the game saves quite frequently so you don't ever go back that far.

I would definitely recommend for anyone enjoying a relaxed story game! It's not too long (I played about 4 hours), so the 30 bucks it asks for is a bit much, but I'd say it was worth it for me. Definitely would recommend buying when on sale!"

This is a game that I have been waiting years to play. My first playthrough took just under 4 hours to beat and it was a very emotion filled experience as you learn more about the characters and the world around you. This game has tons of replayability with all the hidden things to find throughout the landscape. After completing it I found maybe half of the collectible items.

This game is somewhere between an exploration adventure and a visual novel. You're exploration of the areas is rewarded with collectibles, extra pieces of lore and story, and even some bonus hidden things to make the areas feel more special. On top of that you get to live through the game's story as it builds a world of mystery around you before giving you a very impactful and emotional conclusion.

This game is worth the price if you are even slightly interested in what this game has to offer. My time with the first playthrough was amazing and I cannot wait to go through it many more times in the future.

On a side note. The game ran at 60 fps uninterrupted outside of when a few new areas loaded in where there was a mild drop into the 50s before jumping straight back to 60. The camera can feel a bit weird to get used to, but once you get a feeling for it, it feels very natural. The voice acting is very well done, but there are a few times where the tone doesn't fit the scene which can be a bit jarring."

So I attempted to play Lost Ember. I went into this thinking it'd be more of an exploration based game, with heavy story telling and decent game play. However, I can say with confidence that this is not in a fact a game, but a movie with collecting stuff in the background. But the game would not let me explore the area until it decided oh there is an item. And I wouldn't mind as much if the controls weren't bad, the camera was the worse I've seen in awhile, and the game was so railroaded that I could not do anything.
So to start with, the controls are passable, they aren't good, but they do the job. Each animal I got to play as was fun for about 2 minutes, and then they got boring. The only one I enjoyed was the humming bird, and that was because it allowed me to fly, unlike the duck I acquired a little bit before.
The camera, however, makes the game unplayable. The camera likes to breath down your neck as you play the game, and it really shows when you play the wombat. The wombat being the first animal you can play as, its gimmick is you can roll, and it tells you this in some nice, tight tunnels. So when I started rolling, I ran into some rocks in the tunnel, and then almost got softlocked because the camera decided to look at my butt while I was stuck between a rock and a hard place. And if it was a one off bug it'd be fine, but no, anytime you gain a decent amount of speed the camera decides that it likes to see your insides, especially in tight places. When I was trying to get a collectible as the humming bird, the camera quite literally wouldn't let me get the collectible for a solid minute due to the camera zooming around like a mad man.
So the game is not good gameplay wise, but maybe the story is good?
No.
No it's not.
The first red flag should be at the start of the game, when the game lets you turn off the dialogue (which if you do, and have subtitles on, you don't get any dialogue). The voice acting is... passable, though it doesn't work well in any emotional scenes, which is most of the cutscenes I saw. And the story itself was... meh. The concept is cool, but the delivery is of it is bad. I had no attachment to any of the story, and it was all just passable.
I will give this game credit where credit is due though, the visuals were spectacular in some spots, but that is the only positive I can see in this entire game.
TLDR: Bad controls, bad camera, unsatisfying game play, meh story, and some pretty visuals. Not worth the money."

Similar to games such as Journey and ABZÛ, but this has a narrated story. I was really unsure of it, until the end. It's a wonderful story. The game play is relaxing, and you can collect thing along the way.

There's a review that says to change the narration to a language you don't understand because the story ""ruins"" the game, which is absurd. I'm glad I didn't listen to it. ~ If you find you *are* annoyed with the narration of the story, you can turn the voice volume all the way down in audio options."

I enjoyed the game and found the story excellent. Though I suspect this is best played on a controller, it was certainly doable on KBM though certain animals were harder to control (parrot). Finding there was a slow-motion key (Q) was a godsend for that one. I wish they had a post on forums that explained key assignments.

Overall I was quite happy with everything, had no major issues that a return to last checkpoint could not fix and loved being able to change into and try out all the animals! Game was actually better on 2nd go round as I knew what to expect so approached some areas differently while I hunted down all the animals to try out and enjoying playing those.

I picked this game up on sale which is likely the best thing to do for the average player who will only do one playthrough. My first one took about 6 hours or so and then the rest of my time was doing the completionist thing, finding all the relics, mushrooms, etc."

Well, I'm only a short time into it. But I love it already.

It's a very charming game, from the Northern English accented narrator/ball of light/companion, to the cute animals you can control (warping into a duckling and swimming around a little is both 'cool' and 'awww cute' according to my daughter), to the verdant environment you explore. The unfolding story already has me wanting to know more of the what and why.

If you loved Journey, or Abzu, this is a must buy. It's also a very kid friendly game.

Mooneye Studios, well done. This, even to this day, is one of the greatest games I've ever played. This game was something I'd never experienced before. The plot, gameplay, and storyline are so simple and easily executable, but it was crafted masterfully in the Lost Ember. The soundtrack is moving, and the art style is beautiful. The worst thing about this game is simply its lack of content, the story is perfect in both narrative and length, but I don't think I've ever been more emotionally sad about a game ending as I was with this one. When I played this game on the PS4 last year in February, I declared it to be my personal favorite game of all time, and to this day, it still holds that title loud and proud. It felt like I was playing a book, but instead of reading the book, I was writing the book. When I first beat the game, with that ending sequence, I actually cried, it was the first game in my lifetime that got me to break down into my molecular format for beating it. If a sequel, or another game taking place in the same universe, was made, I would not complain at all. My biggest regret was not pre-ordering this game, because good Lord was it amazing. 11/10, would absolutely recommend."

Let's put whether or not the game is good aside. The real question is: Is it worth the money?

If this game were 10 dollars or less, I would say maybe.

But it's not. It's a thirty dollar game with a 5 dollar experience.

I LOOOVE open world/exploration games. I love wandering around in a beautiful field and looking at a massive moon and reminiscing over an old note left by an abandoned shack. The note says something emotional, that one NPC clearly wrote to another NPC, and it makes me think deeply about their life together. Then I go and pick three flowers and somehow craft an entire boat. I love stuff like that. Peaceful, serene, immersive.

When I read reviews saying that this was boring, I gave it a shot anyways, because usually ""boring"" open worlds are my jam.

The people that said it was boring were not lying.

Do not let the cute animals fool you. Nor the pretty graphics.

I could barely make it an hour in. It quite literally is running in a straight line with basically nothing to interact with. You're following some orb, and you're trying to help it, but the story is bland and there's no substance. Perhaps I just didn't play long enough. But I went to several different locations with different animals, and I just could not get into it for the life of me. There are no side missions. It's just jumping from one animal to the next on occasion, and finding random collectibles in obvious/bland places.

If you enjoy exploration games then you probably won't listen to anything I just said and will try it for yourself. That's what I did. So, I would tell you definitely don't buy it, but go ahead and see for yourself. I hope you like it more than I did!

P.S. If you want an amazing exploration game, buy Eastshade. One of the best games I've ever played."

Lost Ember is an indie adventure/exploration game where you play as a gorgeous black wolf in a world where nature reclaimed the spaces left behind by the Yanrana civilization. Throughout the game, you will learn what caused the demise of this people and the role you played in it.

In , you play as a majestic black wolf who just happens to meet a lost spirit on its way to the city of light (heaven). Quickly, the spirit makes it his goal to help you seek redemption to also get to that city and enjoy a peaceful afterlife.

For the most part, you will be able to run freely through the world and relive the memories from your past. Going through obstacles to progress and discovering items left behind along with a few mushrooms (why not?). To help you, you will be able to possess other animals’ bodies for help. From fish to birds, fly and swim through this gorgeous world to get where you need to go on your journey for redemption.

Sadly, its ambition fall short as there is just a lot of repetition in the way you get to explore the different zones, sometimes you will even have to wait for some specific animal to appear to get through the obstacle. Also, there was no real incentive to keep hunting all the collectibles except for achievements as you don’t really get to learn much from them. Without calling it pointless you won’t have the urge to hunt for it.

Though, you really get to choose how you will experience Lost Ember. The entire environment is a joy to run free-in, experienced all differently depending on the animal you control and its perspective. Every animal being unique, the developers adapted the game based on whatever you were playing, and it makes it a delight. Everything felt cute and I was honestly fond of it. Not many games can convey such feelings.

While it becomes self-evident after a while that the story of both the world and the lost soul are intertwined, relieving your memories with more and more context added will help you shape the perspective of who you once were along with an idea of how the Yanrana society lived.

The story while very short (finished the game in 4 hours), ends with a really touching conclusion. While I got some frustrations in the mid-game, the end game just gave me all the feels. The emotions you will feel all along just goes so well with the amazing soundtrack Lost Ember offers.

The game is simply put gorgeous. From the snowy mountains, the desert, the deep caverns, green spaces, the skies and the waterfalls the environment you are in is rich, vast and various. Running, swimming and flying is freeing and will bring you a feeling of calmness while feeling entirely unique in the way you control these different animals. The entire atmosphere of the game revolves around it, between the lost buildings, the fauna and flora this world feels alive in union with nature.

While the graphics aren’t of the highest quality, they are good enough. You will encounter performance issues with screen freezes and textures loading up as you get closer to them. There are some other textures clipping issues that can lead to some funny bugs. The game will also reload after some falls. This made me miss an entire pan of the game during a sandstorm, where I fell and ended up being teleported where I was supposed to be rather than doing whatever the game intended me to do.

Overall, the game is a splendid atmospheric adventure that falls just short of being as memorable as it planned to be. I enjoyed my time with Lost Ember, experienced many feelings and fell in love with its soundtrack. The audience for it might be considered niche, but I encourage you to try it when you want a casual light gaming session, but do me a favor and listen to its soundtrack."

My boyfriend got this game for me for my birthday and I knew right away I needed to 100% it. Played it through twice, once just to enjoy the beautiful visuals and emotional storytelling, and again for all those collectables and achievements. I would definitely recommend this game if you enjoy pretty, narrative-driven games with adorable animals wrapped up in a very human story. This is one of those games that kind of makes you just sit back and think about your life when you finish it. Enjoy."

Overview
Lost Ember is a new game from Mooneye Studios where the player embodies a wolf in search of their past, with the help of a small spirit guide to help them on their journey. The player is taken on a journey where they'll work to discover the history of the world around them while learning more about themselves, uncovering hard truths about their character along the way. This game is similar to many journey-like games, such as Gris and Journey.

It's not a game that will appeal to everyone, but for a handful of folks, it will remain a special experience. I'd recommend this game to a handful of gamers who are looking for a unique and sweet journey with some amazing visuals.


(+) Pros
Beautiful game
Immersive story
Detailed animations
Amazing soundtrack
(-) Cons
Some of the voice acting occurs at unexpected moments, hurting some of the immersion
Collectibles don't feel worth pursuing most of the time


The gameplay is fairly standard for a journey-style of game. For those of you who aren't aware, the game functions as a sort of 'walking simulator', or rather, a 'wolf simulator' where you explore incredibly detailed maps with a spirit companion who's attempting to help you on your journey to the 'city of light'. Along the journey, you discover the ability to inhabit the bodies of other creatures, allowing you to traverse the map in a variety of methods.

You can roam across the verdant hills as a wolf, soar past waterfalls as a bird, or swim down rapid rivers as a fish along your journey and while there's no single 'right' way to play, the options are varied and offer a change of pace. Sometimes it's more enjoyable to climb along cliffs as a mountain goat and in other areas, it may be more tempting to swim down-river past dozens of other fish. You're not obligated to inhabit certain animals other than a few instances to bypass certain puzzles to progress the story and thankfully, the game leaves it up to you to determine how to move forward.

There are a few quick-time events when encountering certain events in the story, which I would argue is the only damper on the gameplay. Personally, I would've liked to have had some degree of freedom on how I'd proceed past certain areas. One other issue that I encountered was certain collectibles offered in the game. For the most part, many of the items you can find and examine in the world open further hints into the game's world about the inhabitants that lived on the land. This does help build the world up but as for some other collectibles, most noticeably the different mushrooms you could find, those offered nothing than a simple checkmark on collectibles you found. Had the mushrooms given more reason for the player to pursue them, it might have compelled me to look for them more often. Unfortunately, they didn't do much for myself and after the 14th mushroom, I generally ignored looking for them from this point.


The story follows a wolf who is approached by a small spirit seen as a ball of light who is attempting to help the wolf journey towards the fabled 'city of light'. Initially, the spirit isn't sure what crime the wolf may have committed to having lost this privilege. However, as the pair continues on their journey, they uncover details about each other's past, both of which help and hinder their journey.

For many games such as this, there's value to be found in exploring the game's world. The story isn't going to be spoiled here but it's a compelling narrative that is only undercut by some weaker set pieces that occur every once in a while. However, the companionship in this game feels genuine as both the wolf and spirit come to understand each other and the decisions made in the past. For a large part of this game, the theme of this game embodies the ideas behind acceptance and moving forward with one's life. It may come off as slightly simplistic at times but it does make an effort to relay moments with as much sincerity as it can muster. Whether or not the developers succeed is up to the discretion of the player, but I felt that they at least hit the right notes most of the time.

What adds to the mystique of the world has to be the little clues that the game leaves about the people who used to inhabit the places you visit. You'll find ruins and abandoned temples, being reclaimed by nature which generally gives you a tantalizing glimpse into the heart of the land. You're often rewarded to explore and I'd recommend you'd take your time to really immerse yourself into the world.


The voice acting, for the most part, is fairly average. You have some really good performances but it is slightly undercut by the narrative element that is sometimes interrupted by your spirit companion. Now, to be fair, your spirit companion is voiced quite convincingly throughout the game but sometimes his voice can be distracting, especially as you explore memories of your past self.

The music is absolutely wonderful. It's perfectly ambient and while there aren't specific tracks I'd point to being 'better' than the other, it always nailed the mood and atmosphere perfectly. It was never intrusive and always felt like it was a part of the visuals, which is incredibly rare, even for a game in this genre.


At the time of this review, I haven't encountered any serious bugs or issues that affected the game in any serious way. That being said, I did have to restart the game twice due to a glitch where a character of mind became stuck on an invisible wall as a wolf. Also, there were some frames that dropped at inopportune times, such as when admiring the scenery near a waterfall.


This isn't a game made for everyone, but it's an experience that's worth sharing with many people. There's no 'win' function or any other repeated gameplay loops but a simple story about a wolf and their spirit companion on a path towards redemption. It's a short game, somewhere in the range of four to six hours, but that's a memorable period for sure. The visuals are absolutely stunning, the soundtrack is exquisite, and the story is memorable. Besides some weak collectible gameplay loops and some of the voice acting, it's still an absolute treasure to explore and I would highly recommend for those interested in this game to pick it up.

After all, the journey is just as important as the destination in the valley of lost embers.

I have a lot of fondness for the Journey/Abzu/GRIS/etc. style of gameplay-light story-driven exploration game genre, and this hit enough of those buttons to get me to finish it, but man, is this lacking in polish. Too long for this subgenre with its overly large levels, too much dialogue, too many poorly signposted areas leading to aimless wandering, and too many instances where the controls and level design can get you stuck in a spot to the point where you’re forced to restart from the last checkpoint (admittedly never a huge setback here, but that wouldn’t be an issue at all in a more tightly designed game).

Oh, and the story attempts to apply horseshoe theory to its two ideological poles of “revolution to overthrow an oppressive regime” and “licking said regime’s boots.” Who wrote this, Ken Levine?"

Lost Ember

Pros
-Gorgeous visuals
-Cute animals!
-Lots of different animals to play as, even a worm!
-Very realistic animations
-Lovely environments and levels
-Relics to collect
-Secrets/Easter Eggs to discover
-Great soundtrack
-Good story

-Sometimes it is unclear where to go
-A couple of bugs in the level design
-Optimisation isn't the best, but is at an acceptable level
-When I first installed the game, I kept getting a fatal error message which went away after opening the game again
-Sometimes the narrative is a little lacklustre, you'll notice when the ember shouts after someone that it doesn't really have much meaning behind it

If you love animals, music, great visuals and stories then Lost Ember might be the game for you!
I'd definitely recommend picking this up if you can."

Visually, this game is a masterpiece, and it feels very fun and satisfying to navigate through its gorgeous environments as all the different animals.

However, there's unfortunately a lot of factors that detract from the overall experience, both minor and major.
















While my time with the game was ultimately still enjoyable, I feel mostly disappointed by the large potential this game had to be better than it is. As such, I'm deciding to not recommend it. But if you're the type to skip story anyway, or don't particularly mind all my criticisms listed above, then, hey. By all means, go for it. The environments really are wonderful to experience."

I played this with a group of friends watching. Everyone was glued to screen and fascinated by the story. We all got emotionally invested, and really touched by the ending, by the characters. At the end of it, one of my friends told me to leave a review of this game in Steam just to tell everyone that we loved it. It was that good.

Short, bittersweet, beautiful. Worth your money for the experience."

Beat the story in about 6 hours, but it's less than that since I left the game running while doing other things. It's a good game, quite lovely and just fun overall. Like others have said, very short, but it's fine. I will say though...since it's like the shortest game I've ever played, it's not worth a full $30. Get it on sale >.> So, yeah! But no...kinda."

Beautiful graphics, clean atmosphere, interesting story. But the forced cutscenes which take twice as long as they need to by panning from scene to scene at abysmal pace just kill it for me.

Also the wonky perspective when possessing the animals makes me feel sick, especially for the wolf: you never end up looking straight ahead. You always have to look forward at this 30 degree angle from the direction the animal is running which is entirely counter intuitive.

Couldn't get myself to finish the game."

First of, I want to throw out that I was a kickstarter backer and have been waiting for this game for over 3 years. Personally it was worth the wait for me, but ultimately I cannot recommend this game to anyone who hasn't been waiting in anticipation as long as I have. To begin with, there isn't much in the way of gameplay, it's mostly a walking simulator with the twist being you can possess different animals to traverse the environment. This isn't much of a problem because the story is pretty great. That is, when the game doesn't get in the way of itself. Every time I found myself getting immersed, taking in the world and what happened in the past, the bloody narrator would open his mouth and ruin it. He felt like a worse companion than Fi from Skyward Sword, always pointing out the obvious and never shutting up when the visuals were doing a perfectly good job of telling the story. On top of that, the voice actor tried to make the character stutter and sound emotional but it mostly comes off as awkward pauses in his sentences that had me sitting there groaning and wishing he would just get the bloody sentence out. Overall it's not the worst game I've ever played, but I feel their should be an option to just shut off the narrator and the dumb song at the end and and just let the visuals do all the talking. The only bug I encountered was near the end, when I'm climbing snowy mountains, and I could hear frogs and birds chirping like i was still back in the forest. Really ruined the atmosphere. I would say hold off on buying this one unless the price drops to $10 or less."

Short Answer:
The best word I can use to describe my feelings on LOST EMBER is ""disconnected"": the environments felt disconnected from the story and each other, the gameplay felt disconnected from the otherwise relaxed and story-focused feel of the rest of the game, the main character felt disconnected from the events of the overall story, and I just felt disconnected from the emotional journey that I was supposed to have as a result.

Long Answer:
LOST EMBER is a story-driven adventure game that places you in the role of a wolf exploring the remains of a fallen world. You're accompanied by a spirit companion that teaches you about the history of the world and its former inhabitants, and together you'll uncover the events that led to your chance encounter—that's not a great explanation of the story, honestly, but saying anything else would require me to go into spoiler territory. I'll be honest, I didn't enjoy this one as much as many other players did, to an extent that I wonder in the back of my mind if I missed something. While it does have its positives (e.g. good visuals, great music), I found a lot of its core elements to be lacking, and sometimes even detrimental to the emotional experience it set out to provide.

. Some locations are directly tied to story beats (e.g. the ruins of an ancient civilization), but they were usually filled with haphazardly-placed art assets and didn't feel as though they lined up with the narrator's descriptions. A lot of maps are way bigger than they need to be and don't have much detail to justify their size, making them a chore to cross. The more confined spaces, on the other hand, are surprisingly hard to navigate, partly due to confusing level design and partly because your camera is always pushed in way too close to your character so it constantly gets in the way. This is probably a stupid nitpick, but the transition between different biomes throughout the game felt really jarring at times, like going from a ruined mountaintop city to a desert to a rainforest in just a few minutes time—almost like there's something missing that should be connecting each location. The sense of wonder from exploration would turned into boredom and frustration pretty quickly, and it made it hard to stay immersed in it all.

The main gameplay mechanic is the ability to transform into other nearby animals, a feature that ended up being far more limited than I expected. Each one serves a singular purpose—letting you get past a specific type of obstacle that your default wolf form can't—and trying to take these animals too far past the obstacle they spawn near will have you stopped by an invisible wall until you exit your transformation. There's no puzzle element to their use, no room for experimentation or creative problem-solving, just a definitive start and finish line for each animal (aside from a few that are there for added set dressing). Beyond this, you have unexpected quick time events that go against the otherwise relaxed pace of the rest of the game, and there are over 200 collectibles tucked away across some of the maps that add an out-of-place (not to mention cumbersome) collectathon to the mix. Gameplay can be a powerful tool when using video games as a storytelling medium; but .

The story is delivered piecemeal by visiting ""memories"" (represented by a little red smoke signal on the floor) scattered around the map, which give you you a bit of lore via slideshow-esque cutscenes while your companion explains in no uncertain terms what exactly you're looking at. Nearly every piece of meaningful dialogue comes from memories and cutscenes, meaning control of your character and camera have to be constantly wrestled away from you so you can be told what's going on; and the constant stop-and-go pacing gets grating after a while. As for the story itself, it didn't really resonate with me the same way it did for other people. One of the biggest strengths storytelling in games has is its ability to make the player feel like a part of the story, and I don't think did the best job of that. Sure, you're technically part of the story since nothing progresses without your input, but the only meaningful impact you have comes from an arbitrary ability to break the ethereal barriers that block your companion's path. The bulk of the story revolves around viewing events that have already taken place, while the rest is just listening to your companion go through their own character arc that you have no influence over. , following a local tour guide in some moments and playing chauffeur for the real protagonist in others. This feeling was only made worse by the final chapter, .

An unintentional band-aid solution exists in the ""minimalistic mode"", a setting that completely disables the companion's narration, which was added in response to player criticisms that his constant exposition was ruining the experience. Turning this setting on leaves most of the story open to interpretation and obfuscates your character's inconsequential place in the story, but doing this comes with its own problems. Without the narration, all you're left with is the visual storytelling, which isn't great: the big, empty environments don't do much, if anything, to help tell the story on their own; the cutscenes use red silhouette character models that all look too similar at a glance, making it hard to tell who's who when you're not being told directly; and the companion's entire character arc, which drives much of the emotional impact of the story's latter half, is completely removed since it's only conveyed through the narration. The story they tried to tell just wasn't designed to be told this way; and even though this mode did a lot to improve things for many players, I can't confidently say the same for myself.

It's not an outright bad game by any means, but it didn't click with me in the way I was hoping it would, especially after seeing so many reviews saying how emotional and impactful it was for them. If you think you're more likely to feel the same as them and still want to pick it up, I would still do so—but I would wait for a sale, because it's $30 price tag is a bit steep for how much you get. , and trying to extend that time through achievement/collectible hunting just detracts further from the overall experience. I know it comes with a complimentary VR version that adds to the value, but that's not very helpful if you're like me and don't own a VR headset."

Lost Ember looks nice and has its moments, like rolling down a hill as a wombat. You can control different animals and run around with them. But aside from visuals, the game doesn't offer much.
Most of the time you're playing as the wolf, switching to other animals is usually mandatory instead of optional, I wish you had more of a choice here. The exploration aspect is there, but not as relevant as you'd expect, since the world is quite big and empty, and the collectibles are poorly implemented. The story is interesting but kinda sappy, although that might just be my take on it. The game is also rather short, I finished it in about 4 hours; the story is the main driving force of the game, so you're probably gonna finish it in roughly the same time (unless you try to get all the collectibles, in which case you'll be busy for many more hours than that). Replay value is also low for the same reason.

In the end it's mostly a running simulator with nice visuals and a few gimmicks. And for 30€ that's a bit underwhelming. Not that bad if you can get it on sale though."

Lost Ember is a visually stunning game and the music is fantastic. From start to finish, I felt highly invested in the story of the wolf and her light friend and discovering our way to rejoining the City of Light. I'll be the first to say I'm not the best with directions, but in this game, that helped. I made a couple of discoveries I may not have otherwise made. Adding the variety of mushrooms and relics to find adds to the history and I will most definitely say that I love the addition of the fan art to the game itself. The fan art they included is as amazing as the game itself. Being able to play multiple different animals was also a nice touch, as was the developers decision to include the ""Fallen Heroes."" What an amazing way to honor the people who helped make the game real.
While the ending wasn't something I expected, I'll also say it's definitely worth playing through the game and finding out the rest of the story. I will definitely be looking forward to what Mooneye Studios has in store for us next."

This game has a nice visual style and relaxing music, but it's not my cup of tea. The gameplay consists of exploration and narration, but in my opinion the level design is not done well and (at least for me) this game lacks some sort of helping hand, a simple map or a compass - I understand that the devs wanted to keep the UI to a minimum, but I'm a little lost here. The game also has dynamic FOV, which just gives me a headache, not something that I want from a relaxing game. FOV settings should be standard in any modern 3D game. Camera also requires a constant babysitting.

I'd recommend getting this game as a part of a bundle or in a deep sale, definitelly not for 30€."

Lost ember is an interesting concept explore past through memory's that you can trigger at certain locations to discover a history to the fallen world around you. You start off as a wolf, which is your main form throughout the game you can transition into a number other animals to assist you on your journey and reach areas that you could not as the wolf. I have to say my personal favourites were the hummingbird and the fish.

This was an absolutely outstanding game. I have to say I think this is one of the only games that I have ever played that has almost made me cry. Beautiful and emotive story telling that keeps you intrigued until the end which really hits you in the feels. The artwork is amazing if you enjoy taking pretty screenshots you'll have a field day with this. The music is just the icing on the cake some great choices to convey the emotions of the scene and very relaxing music that you can chill to as you soar through the sky or swim through the rivers.



There are one or two cons to the game the first is that unfortunately when you are a smaller animal travelling through tunnels there are some clipping issues so you can see through the tunnel wall into the rest of the world which is a shame as it really impacts immersion and I feel with a bit of fine tuning the could of avoided this. I encountered one bug where I got stuck in the phasing stage from mole to wolf, this only happened once and I think it was because I tried to phase in an area to small as the wolf phases backwards behind the creature you are in. Finally be aware of your surroundings I have got stuck transforming back into the wolf in an area where the wolf cant get out of and there are no animals to transform into.



Overall I would say this is a must recommend two of the issues I have faced I would have to say are player error, although even if they were not the story is so brilliant that it wouldn't matter. I will definitely be replaying this in the future."

like another negative review said, i really don't know how this game has gotten as much love as it has. while it does seem like a labor of love for the developers and had a successful kickstarter, i really don't know where all of that has gone into.

it controls very poorly; whenever i'd inevitably run off a cliff due to the turning being weird and the camera being constantly too close to view the terrain around me properly, i'd always respawn right on the edge of a cliff and fall back off. this lead to a lot of frustration in getting back to a safe area so i could properly get around again - i had this happen with basically all land-bound animals.

the story didn't really seem to have anything to do. it was dramatic, but the ending fizzled out for me.

a lot of sequences seemed taken from a very similar game, journey. pretty much the entire half of the game after you leave the city. and due to this game's issues it just made me want to stop and play journey instead.

as mentioned above, the camera is very wonky. regularly you can see through the level geometry, mostly while underground or swimming, but sometimes while just running around as wolf. it hovers way too close behind you and causes wolf to take up so much of the screen that you can't appreciate the landscape, even though the game tries to give you some really lovely vistas.

finally, even though i have a fairly good gaming laptop, this ran extremely poorly. i can run mmorpgs and more polished single player games on this, but for some reason this game lagged almost constantly and froze up. having to stutter step around everywhere just made my experience feel slow. the game didn't feel fun at all. i really can't recommend this to anyone at this point, and i feel bad about that because so many other people seemed to like it and the developers clearly do.

Pros: This game is so calming. The music and the tone of the narrator are so soothing. Playing this game helps with my anxiety so much and there is no pressure to move on in the story until you want to. The graphics are absolutely gorgeous and it is very easy to get lost in the beauty of little things while just exploring the areas.

Cons: It can be easy to get lost sometimes. Trying to fly with the duck can get a little frustrating and almost clunky especially since it does a downward flight pattern. (But it could just be user error. Not sure)
My biggest complaint (which isn't that big), PLEASE fix it where you can accidentally swap to the wolf at very inopportune times. i.e. CLIFF EDGES. I've gotten stranded a couple of times on cliff edges as a wolf because I would hit the wrong button and then be stuck because I couldn't morph into anything that could fly. Why? Because any other animal would be too far and it takes the system a bit to send a random animal close enough to you to morph into."

I stopped playing when I hit chapter four. This game has some good ideas but not enough of them. Playing as different animals is cool the first couple of times; then it gets monotonous, especially since each has its own slight differences in control scheme and there's something annoying about each one. The fish sequences are the worst because there is no good way for you to see a damned thing and the water blur will make you crazy. The best way to get out of the game's perpetual narrow-FOV tunnel vision would be to play hummingbird the whole way, but you'd lose a finger pressing A because the hummingbird only moves in bursts.

(By the way, the game does not play well with keyboard/mouse, and some of the onscreen key cues when you play that way are actually misleading. I had to switch to controller when I got to the first ""dive down into tunnel"" mole sequence. I couldn't get it to work any other way. Up/down movements for birds and fish are much easier with controller anyhow, FYI.)

As for the story, let's put it this way: Normally I am perfectly willing to play ""walk around for the next plot dump"" games just to see how the story ends. This one, I didn't particularly care. I think some of it is the indirectness of it; we never really get much of a feel for the person who is theoretically our POV narrator, and our ""helpful"" laser pointer guide manages to be like the worst bits of Wheatley crossed with the worst bits of Navi.

The scavenger hunt elements are similarly purposeless ... yeah, okay, I can find relics and mushrooms but I don't really feel like there's any reason to, and this is coming from someone who went out of their way to collect every single Nirnroot in Elder Scrolls: Oblivion.

It's a beautiful world with a fairly clever mechanic waiting for something more interesting to happen in it."

Lost Ember is absolutely beautiful, in terms of story, visuals, and soundtrack. A lot of the game is spent travelling and exploring the world around you as you look for clues to uncover the story of its past, but the gameplay makes all of this enjoyable and relatively varied. That being said, it feels more like an experience than a typical video game. I think the story, exploration, and beauty make it well worth it, but I know that's not everyone's thing. I followed this game through very early development and I was really impressed with how it came out in the end, and my only regret is not supporting the kickstarter when I had the chance to!"

Animal Simulator.
Very relaxed and slow paced game. You can run/fly/swim/crawl as 15 different animals.
The choice to switch bodies usually arrives when have to bypass water sections or high ground areas, but
you can always return to the default wolf shape or carry on exploring as a bird or something else.

Press W to proceed.
Two collectible types (relics and mushrooms) will challenge you to check corners, ledges above or below you,
but it's all about running forward. Even story memories aren't hidden - highlighted by red smoke and placed on your path.
No puzzles to slow you down - there isn't one. You can't even die by jumping off the heights (I tried).

Big and contrasting levels.
The first part of the game features only day-bright forest locations. Later, you travel to sandy canyons, oasis patches,
explore underwater, watch how evening lights changes and eventually have to fight through storms and blizzard.

And as you explore new lands, background story unfolds more and more, from the memories you learn the past of yourself
and your companion."

Lost Ember is a game offering promising game mechanics and story, though both missed their mark. To summarize: I think that this game is beautiful and had potential, but a lack of use of its mechanics to create fulfilling puzzles or challenge puts too much focus on the holes in the writing.

Pros:
+Beautiful artstyle, map, and character design+
+An amazing soundtrack+
+Nearly fully voice acted (Pretty well done too. It was not something I expected.)+
+Accessibility settings to avoid button mashing (though I can't see why the mashing was the plan in the first place.)+
+Remappable controls+
+Fun animal morphing mechanic+
+Movement feels very fluid and fun in this game, such as when you're running or flying (I adore sliding down the rivers as a fish.)+
+Memory mechanic is neat+
+Options for no commentary (Character speaking outside of cutscenes) is available. (though I'd like to see a silent cutscene option too.)+

Cons:
-The gameplay is VERY liner and doesn't well utilize the mechanics it has. If you're using an animal ability once morphed, it's basically only to get past an obstacle. There's not much to do except keep moving in the story. There is no puzzles that you could use the animals to get through, no mechanics you truly need to learn to progress. It's just ""oh no. There's a wall in front of you. Use this buffalo we placed right here to knock it down so you can switch to wolf on the other side.""-
-The writing is mixed at best. I can see the story they are aiming for, and it's not a bad story, but the way they get there feels off. The characters are very flip-floppy with their emotions and actions, and this caused me to be more frustrated with them than invested in the story. (Spoilerish example: Someone gets mad and runs off for a very good reason, only to come back not even a minute later to apologize and say that they won't leave again.)-
-Despite options to avoid motion sickness, this game is still pretty jarring to play. Both the loose feeling of the camera (not keeping the wolf somewhat anchored in one area) and immediate cuts to black if you fall even the slightest distance were making me quite sick while playing. I don't recommend to people with these issues.-
-The cutscenes aren't skippable and get quite annoying when you have to restart a checkpoint and have to redo them.-
-You can and probably will get stuck and have to restart a checkpoint multiple times thanks to the level design in this game. -
-This game is very ""up to interpretation"" on some things. Weird ones too. I honestly don't even know who the character we are even is or why some things are brought up in the story.-
-The dang collectible/mushroom system is hell. If you want everything, prepare to spend hours hunting through a single map or painfully following a guide if you want 100% achievements.-"

Looking at the past through wolf's eyes

Lost Ember is an interactive visual story, told with great attention to how it's presented. Players take a role of soul wandering Wolf accompanied by a lost spirit. The duo seeks through memories of their past and the remnants of an old civilisation. Plot touches on numerous issues ranging from class inequality to subtle commentary about nature and environment. This is an emotional story.

Developers focus on grand picturesque open areas: colorful meadows, lost cities, grand canyons filled with waterfalls. Game's artistic imagery is enhanced through fantastic soundtrack. Audio-visual design tells a story of it's own and is an integral part of storytelling.

Even though I have a deep appreciation towards the game's story and visual design, I found it lacking in terms of gameplay. Lost Ember's „possess” mechanic feels lackluster. The collectible hunt works against the overall feel of the game as it exposes graphical simplicity and subpar level design.

This is definetly a positive review but I cannot recommend the game to everyone. Simplicity of gameplay paired with flawed collectible hunt cast a shadow on Lost Ember. Yet, as an emotional, visually impressive story it achieves artistic heights, far above the grasp of many other projects.

I can't say I'm super stoked about this game. Its a good game, don't get me wrong. Other then the many Unreal Engine crashes I had, the game was really nice. But.. Its too linear for me. It gives you no reason to explore at all. You just follow the main path, and reveal more story. The game is essentially a book, except you have to write the rest of the book yourself because there isn't much story written in said book.

To be fair, the price is a bit much. I am not sure if I would spend the total €30 for it, but in a sale, I would 100% recommend if you like peaceful story games.

First of all, I love the feature of getting the option to play different kinds of animals. You explore the world as an animal who is trying to help a lost soul (to not spoil much... I hope). Along the road you find some memories of the animal to figure our it's past life.

Fair to say I love playing through this game, exploring the worlds and trying to find all mushrooms and relics (still working on it). It's a peaceful game, so don't expect any fighting and falling of a cliff doesn't influence the game or you in any way.

I use this game to relax and calm my brain and for that, I'd rate this game a 8/10. It's a sit back and relax game!"

I sadly wasn't able to back this game when it was on kickstarter, but I did snag it when I saw it on steam over the lunar sale. Finally got around to playing it and all I can say is wow, what a fantastic game! The scenery is breathtaking and the story
is captivating. I love walking simulators when they tell a good story, however this game focused heavily on exploration and animal design with a good story to back it up. Being an animal lover, I found that balance kept me coming back over and over until I finished it. Whether I was losing it over how cute some of the baby animals were, running around getting collectibles, or progressing the story, I was enthralled. I highly recommend playing it if you too love a good story, walking simulators, or just love animals.

The only con that I noticed while playing was that the camera seemed to be a little fidgety, and would sometimes become a little unresponsive to my mouse. Hopefully that is just a personal issue and not something that everyone experiences."

Lost Ember isn't particularly bad but it's not particularly good either.

Pretty much, it's just alright. There are places that look really cool but a lot of the environments are just empty and bland. Possessing different animals for different abilities is a nice idea but most of them are just not fun to use. The voice acting is decent in most situations but doesn't really do the story justice when it comes to the emotional moments. The controls are somewhere between poor and average. The story is okay but underwhelming because of the game design. Most importantly, it's dull with little actual game play.

The basic game play has you run from smoking waypoint to smoking waypoint to get flashbacks of a story. You have to switch animals sometimes to get around obstacles but most of it is just running from point to point. If you want to, you can try find all the hidden items in the world. The flashbacks tell a story but pretty much all narrated static images or freeze frames of weird red models that look a bit like the mummies from Pompeii. That, combined with your main character being completely silent, makes it near impossible to form any attachment to the characters, so the emotional bits are lost.

It would've been a much better game if we could actually play the flashbacks. That would have added some excitement (and actual gameplay) and provide real opportunities to bond with the characters. Things do get a little better as the game progresses but the few interesting or exciting sequences are completely outnumbered by the boring ones.

Edit: The song at the end is pretty cool though."

You can play as a baby duckling. 10/10

On a more serious note, this is an impressive debut game from a small team of developers. Featuring gorgeous imagery, lots of cute animals, a lovely soundtrack and an emotional story.

You play - mostly - as a wolf who is called upon by a mysterious spirit. Your task is to find out what happened in your past. As the game is fairly short, to say any more than that would be getting into spoilers.
Suffice to say that along the way you will need to ""possess"" many different kinds of animals to navigate the obstacles in your path. Dig into underground tunnels as a mole, soar into the skies as a hummingbird or parrot, swim upstream as a fish, climb mountains as a goat and much more. While I was aware of many animals that were going to be featured in the game (many of them stretch goals during the campaign), the amount of variety in the final game still managed to impress.

As of writing this, the game has only been out for a couple of days and there are still quite a few bugs to be ironed out. Fell through the map a few times and occasionally got stuck in the landscape, forcing me to restart from a checkpoint. Thankfully, checkpoints are ample and usually only a minute or two of progress was lost.

Highly recommended if you love relaxing games and/or cute, cuddly animals."

I backed this game on Kickstarter with an estimated delivery date of March 2018. Needless to say, it came out a little late.

For that reason, I have found the game to be underwhelming so far. Three years of hype is a lot to live up to. The best part of the game is definitely the story. I'm only two hours in, and it's already moved me. I just don't feel like it's worth $30.

The gameplay is plain. It's a very linear walking simulator, except you walk around as different animals that can do different cute things. The graphics are great, but the levels are either overwhelmingly expansive or constrictive. The voice acting is pretty high quality, but the recording is lacking. There is an echo or something that makes the people and animal voices sound tinny, which breaks the immersion for me. Something is missing from the cutscenes; they are choppy, both in the animations and in the audio.

I was hoping that, after so many development delays, the final product would be a little more robust and polished."

I'm unsure if I would recommend this game. I only played a short time of it because; first, I ran into a mountain that didn't exist and proceeded to continuously fall through the world, even as it respawned the character.

Then when I chose ""restart to last checkpoint"" when I was in chapter 3, It restarts me at the beginning of the game where I must travel all that distance again to reach where I last was.

THEN as I was entering chapter 2, a pathway that I had taken previously had completely disappeared and I again fell through the world on a loop. Prompting me to just quit the game. I think I'm going to uninstall it for now, don't know if I will ever give it another try."

One of the few games to blow me away, Lost Ember is a must-play for anybody who enjoys heartfelt story, visuals, or anybody who looks for games to simply vibe along with.

I have bought this through Humble Bundle and one day decided to do a blind play-through-- not knowing ANYTHING about this game aside from what the trailer here on Steam shows. I haven't even read any of the reviews.

Since I'm one of those people who love story based and environmental, artistic, feely games, I was dedicated to play through this entire game in one sitting because I was so hooked to see what would happen next.

The story is simply fantastic and especially wound up the closer to the end it has gotten. It starts a bit shy, but by the end, the feelings hit.

I expect to play through this game a couple times by the time I'm done with it, for sure!

Pros
The graphics are absolutely STUNNING.
The soundtrack is EVEN MORE STUNNING.
This game is super friendly to casual players or even people who have never really touched 3D graphics engine games.
The story is amazing if you like story's that are roller-coaster rides of emotion."

Lodt Ember is an up to 5-7 hours adventure game, that is both lamentable and cute at the same time. It has interesting mechanics, hearttouching plot and a lot of cute and amazing creatures, that will help you through the story. Game graphic may look simple at the first look, but it's still breathtaking at some moments. Soundtrack composition, imo, could be little different than it is, but sometimes it still did bring feelings of joy and developers efforts.

This game falls just short of being everything I wanted from it. While it’s stunning visuals had me running circles just to enjoy each area a little longer a few key issues put a damper on my experience. Textures/objects not loading properly, getting stuck in soft lock zones with only a checkpoint system to reload back to and the occasional character movement clunky ness took me out of the experience when it happened to come up. When everything was working smoothly however it feels magnificent. Definitely worth a play but I wouldn’t want to try 100% the game searching every nook and cranny."

First, Steam glitched or something, because I did not play for 39 hours. More like 8.

This game is hard to give a simple thumbs up or thumbs down. It really deserves a sideways, but a thumbs down felt too harsh.

There is a lot of good in this game. The story is good, and at times touching. There are moments when you are running through the tall grass, listening to a pan flute, relaxing, and the game is really great. Dashing around trees and through caves. Piecing together the mystery. Any time I was pushing shift+W, and listening to music, I was enjoying myself.

But then there are times that the game is really bad. First, you are accompanied by a flying spark, reminiscent of Navi from Ocarina of Time. It is something of a companion, but it is also an annoying exposition machine. Instead of letting the story beats land, and let the player reflect on them, the spark will tell you what happened, and how you should feel about it. ""Oh, look at those people dying. How sad. People shouldn't die like that. I must make you really angry."" It is really rough, because the exposition ruins the flow of so much of the emotion in this game. I wish they had found ways to eliminate that exposition, even if it left more mysteries in the game.

Second, the game has a Banjo-Kazooie level of collectibles, which is really odd in this game. Again, running through the tall grass with wonderful music is a great experience. Seeing a collectible, gliding as a duck to get it, missing, and needing to waddle slowly up the hill to try again is a horrid experience. I recommend skipping the collectibles, since there are hundreds of them, but seeing all of them around and ignoring them is also frustrating if you completionist tendencies, as I do.

Should you play this game? There are better games out there, but this game is occasionally great."

The story was impactful, I will give it that much. It's been a long time since I was this upset at the conclusion of a story I thought was going somewhere better. The closing of the game left a bitter taste.

Mild spoilers:

Major spoilers:

Mechanically, I enjoyed this game. It is pleasant to look at, the movement and possession mechanics are satisfying. The camera has problems with glitching through walls, but there are some really beautiful moments. It was 6-7 hours to complete, which is a length I enjoy; it doesn't feel artificially padded. (There are collectibles and it might get annoying if you are trying to 100% those.)

Okay first thing is first: This game is NOT worth the $30 it's sold at right now.

It's a walking sim but with a great movement mechanic and the ability to shift into animals to get through certain areas. You go from place to place in the afterlife, sometimes in very fun and inventive ways, and explore points of interest which reveal more about your life when you were alive. The voice acting is a bit rough but the story is interesting enough to keep your attention. The music cues are sometimes lacking but visually the team did an amazing job for their team size.

I'd try to grab it at $15 or less, personally. It's an indie game and it has a lot of weak points but overall is a great game to play through... just not worth $30."

This game is probably one of the most relaxing, beautiful games i have ever played.
Since I love to explore the environment and look at pretty scenery, this game was perfect, especially because finding the relics and mushrooms gave you a small reward for taking your time to look at everything.

I loved the story as well, even though I personally would have preferred a different ending to it, but no spoilers here and of course whether you like it or not is something very subjective!

If I would really want to search for something negative about this game, it would be a few small texture issues or some invisible walls in places a bit more far away from the story path. It did not disturb the gameplay at all and you really just notice it if you go quite far away from where the story is trying to lead you.

Tough to rate this one. It is pretty, and the narrative is presented well even though the story is commonplace. The gameplay is somewhat at odds with itself though. If you follow the path you get plot snippets that are nice, but the collectibles are off the path, so if you hunt those you sometimes miss the plot vignettes. Hunting the collectibles was fun at first, but there's no mechanism telling you if you've found all of them in a given area, and there are many points of no return where you cannot go back, so once it became obvious I had missed some I quit looking - plus it was taking so long going to every little nook in each area. I guess in the end I'll give it a thumbs up. It certainly isn't a bad game, but it's not a great one either."

This game, while breathtaking and gorgeous, suffers from a lack of level definition. It's ""open world"" until it's not, and you can tell you're getting further and further out of bounds by how polygonal the trees and things get. This game tries to incentivize exploration through collectibles, but ultimately the levels are so clunky that exploring and trying to find collectibles feels like more of a chore and a game of chance than actually exploring. There was a section where I glitched so hard that I had to restart the game, and that's when I stopped hunting for collectibles that were not immediately in my path.

The story itself is decent, though the way it ends is not my favorite."

*For the World is Hollow, and I Have Touched The Sky*

Lost Ember is a game made by someone who tried to combine Dark Souls and the bible and then set it in a post rapture mayan type backdrop. I cannot bring myself to give this title anything higher then a 2.5 out of 5. Other reviewers have probably said what I am about say better, but I am going to try and stab at it anyways.

I want to do a pro/con list here but for the life of me I can't find a pro that justifies purchasing the game when its not on sale. Its really pretty. You can howl. Animals *sometimes* have cute little things they do. Cons outweigh all of this however. So here is the list;

PROS
-Very pretty game
-possess animals
-make the animal you possess do cute things

CONS
-Railroad. Seriously. Its a 'just keep moving forward for 4 hours' kind of game
-there's no puzzles
-collectibles are a joke. They provide no narrative to the game. No hidden secret. No insight to the culture outside what you would assume of the item. Find a spear? ""The tribe used these for hunting."" That's the text. And you're expected to explore these huge empty areas to find 1 or 2 in a sequestered corner.
-Animal possession mechanic? Yeah i hope you enjoy being the same 3 animals for most of the game. And the camera loves to freak out when you possess or go back to being a wolf.
-Ducks can fly right? sure, but apparently they can't fly up at all. This one really got to me.
-There is only 1 voice actor in the game, and I sure hope you like hearing about how great and amazing this dead civilization was and how terrible you are. Because that's most of his lines. Visual story would have been so much better.
-Story is extremely predictable. Like extremely. It's a pseudo acceptance into heaven for a lost soul narrative. You get that from the beginning. But they try and hide it and do BIG REVEALS with cut scenes of...well I am honestly unsure if they have anything to do with how the civilization fell. Especially since it was SO AMAZING

Honestly, it did not take me long at all to begin rooting against what the game was trying to do. I was glad the civilization was in ruin and the people were all dead. I was driven forward to try and confirm my suspicion that the pseudo-heaven was empty, or that the civilization was ended by one of the several plagues that are kind-of-but-not-really talked about, or a war with the neighboring nation(s?) that they may or may not have conquered and enslaved. The first cut scene mentions that humans who don't get proper funerary rights reincarnate as filthy beasts and are not admitted into pseudo-heaven. So maybe I will lead the rest of the lost souls into the light?

Nah son. Sorry but that's too deep.

At the end of this game I was left with no answers. Everyone was dead except for a single sentient wolf. The world was empty. Devoid of life. Bereft of meaning. I traveled for miles only to be given the answers I already had. Left with a thousand questions that will never be answered."

I'm not entirely sure how this game got such high reviews to be honest. I'm guessing the people who played it only remember the very end of the game where it starts to pick up, but IMO it never really gets anywhere.

The game suffers from stutters between loading sections, and the camera often clips inside the geometry, including during the in game cutscenes.

The story is incredibly generic and been told many many times before and consists of the usual plot arc of; greed > conflict > revenge > regret > forgiveness. You've probably seen the same tale told thousands of times before with different characters and settings, and probably told in a more interesting way.

The collectables are for the most part uninteresting and there are far too many of them. If you choose to go explore the world you are often left let down. The ""legendary"" animals are pretty uninspired too being literally a bloom glow.

The main draw of this game to me was the ability to possess the many different animals and use there abilities, which for the most part were not well implemented. A lot of the time the entire point of using them were to get around barriers, and no puzzle elements were ever introduced. The most memorable moments using animals for me were the fish water slide segments and the parkour mountain goat segments. Also the hummingbird controls were incredibly frustrating, not sure why the ability to move was mapped to having to repeatedly press a button.

Usually I really enjoy these kinds of games but the extreme frustration and boredom of the first chapters made it hard for me to even enjoy the later chapters, and try to care about the ongoing story. Speaking of which I had already figured out the plot twist by the second chapter and I'm not sure why the writing seemed to think it was a well kept secret.

I cannot recommend this game because of my experience with it. Your experience may differ."

It's beautiful, really. It's well worth your time, but as far as being worth your money, mileage may vary.

The art is beautiful, cinematic moments are beautiful, the music is beautiful, and the story is beautiful too. My recommendation is to play it as a story, go along with the flow and the linear path and just enjoy the experience. You can reload chapters later to hunt for legendary animals, relics, and mushrooms. The cinematics and story are worth not messing with the flow by checking every nook and cranny your first time through."

There's something to be said about games like Lost Ember. Regardless of how you shake a stick at it, this game is a work of art. You can tell a lot of love went into this game, and that love definitely shines through.

Lost Ember is a... well, it's a... you know what? Lost Ember is quite difficult to classify as a specific video-game genre. And that's honestly a fantastic thing, really. Lost Ember is a journey through a beautiful world where humanity is long gone and nature has rightfully reclaimed the land. You play as a wolf, who ventures forth alongside a glowing red orb as you both attempt to find the ""City of Light"", or the afterlife. It's well orchestrated storytelling about love, loss, betrayal, and forgiveness.

The game-play is remarkably straightforward, with much of the game's entire structure build around exploration and utilizing the wildlife around you to uncover different parts of the scenery as you uncover the memories of how you ended up as the wolf who is searching for the afterlife. That's it really, and that's actually fantastic. Given the free-form revolving around exploration, there's no map, no status bars, no compass, none of the bloat the screens tend to have with most video-games nowadays. I'd honestly say that's a fantastic choice on the developer's part.

Now, just like any other game ever created, this too suffers from a few minor hindrances, but nothing so terrible as to detract from how satisfying Lost Ember really is. For whatever reason, the developers built a collection system into the game. I'm not saying that it's necessarily a bad thing so much as I'm saying it's wildly out of place and honestly very jarring compared to the overall experience. It may have been more successful as a mechanic had the collection of items had something to do with the plot of the game, or added something to the overall world-building, but when you stumble across a Pokeball in your adventure, you definitely get ripped out of the immersion very abruptly. Beyond that questionable mechanic, there are a handful of minor bugs and graphical errors that appear from time to time, but they're nothing that can't be easily ignored in favor of how satisfying the overall game is.

For a game that can be loosely completed in about five hours, I'd say this game is actually worth it's price. It's seems like a steep cost given how short the game is, but you can easily get lost in this game, and that's really what counts in the end."

Lost Ember is a game that I really wanted to like. I even set it aside for a while before playing it because I thought that it would be a game that would tug at my heartstrings. After finishing it, I feel like I want both my money and my 3 hours back. Lost Ember is a game that desperately wants to be the next Journey or Abzu, but the developers seem to have misunderstood what makes those games special.

In Lost Ember, you play as a wolf accompanied by a fairy-esque spirit companion. You journey throughout the land, watching cutscenes and turning into various animals to progress. Perhaps the biggest failing with this game is that it treats the player like an idiot. Your companion constantly chatters to you about what you should do, to the point where I found it to be incredibly patronizing during my playthrough. He talks over cutscenes, actively destroying the ""show don't tell"" mantra that similar games use to their advantage. This issue is compounded even further by the awkward English voice acting.

The narrative suffers from severe plot holes and awkward pacing in the last third of the game. The few characters they even had in Lost Ember are both contradictory and uninspired. If you need an example, look no further than the point when the player enters the Emperor's castle. Your companion discusses how it is cruel that they kept wolves in cages, but then proceeds to talk about how exciting the animal fighting ring was to watch not 2 minutes later.

The story as a whole lacks any sort of bite. I never felt attached to any of the characters involved since the story moved so quickly from plot point to the next. Characters ""argue"" and go their separate ways only to come back together as friends no less than 5 minutes later. This is a game that is supposed to hook me by its story and dialogue, yet it lacks the confidence to present something beyond a cliche development. On top of this, the player is regularly railroaded into story sequences that remove player control completely. This game's narrative just doesn't seem to mesh well with games as a whole because it seemingly cannot trust the player to interact with and learn about the world themselves.

Exploration is ruined by the sense that everything was designed purely for the player's sake. If you are stuck in an area, look no further than 5 feet away because there is probably an animal you can transform into to get out. Open areas are not only barren, but littered with collectibles that provide nothing more than flavor text. This game's ""cities"" are nothing more than empty streets and rooms. There is no sense of history to any of the ruins, and thus no sense that anyone ever lived in this game's once great civilization at all.

The real twist of the knife is that animals are laughably robotic in this game. Lost Ember's animations are floaty and awkard, with no sense of weight, rhythm, or impact. The AI is incredibly bonkers, effectively ruining any semblance of atmosphere this game was supposed to have. Rodents run off of cliffs and birds fly into walls. Most animals just sit vacantly, doing nothing until the player interacts with them. Ducklings are probably the most egregious example of that, seeing as they do literally nothing. Animals in Lost Ember are more like powerups than anything else, which completely misses the point of portraying a game in nature in the first place.

For a game that is supposed to be all about nature, I don't understand why the developers chose to have somber music playing for almost the entire playthrough. In my opinion, the soundtrack is nothing to write home about, but it also steps on some of the game's tender moments. Nature is best experienced in its purest form, games like Rain World capture that essence brilliantly. Lost Ember's music undermined its own selling point: a natural world to explore.

This game is absolutely plagued with narrative, technical, and design issues that I simply cannot overlook. I never buy or review a game thinking that I won't enjoy it beforehand. After all, reviews are glowing for this game. A whopping 90/100 from PCGamer was enough to convince me to give it a go, and I almost feel like everyone else played a different Lost Ember than I did. I can't help but feel like this game is mediocre, and I cannot recommend it in good conscience. For $29.99 you could buy 2 copies of Journey, a much better game, instead."

Some are saying that the game is only worth being purchased when it's on sale, while others that they would even pre-purchase this.
Some are saying that the game is worth being played, while (very few) that it's not.

What I know is that even though I've never been a fan of indie games this one felt different from anything played before and I did enjoy every single minute spent playing Lost Ember.

If you like fantasy worlds with a cool soundtrack and nice story line, this game is definitely the complete pack for you, but a thing that it's important to mention is that you shouldn't pay 100% attention to the description of the game because this is quite vague and there are missing a lot of important details that would (perhaps) make you want to play the game. Such as the game is not all about playing with various animals exploring a broken world, but most likely that you are playing the role of collecting all those puzzle pieces to find out what caused the world to be like that."

Im a huge fan of exploration games like Journey, Abzu, Firewatch and more, is basically one of my favorite genre of videogames. But an exploration game is not the same as a ""walk simulator"" game. The exploration game has this thing that intrigues you, hypnotizes you and guides you in all the process of the game and that is one of the things this game lacks ."" Lost Ember"" has a beautiful visual and concept art, but thats it...

1) The story has a LOT of potencial, but they didnt make it work and it felt absolutely flat, simple (even contradictory sometimes) and also predictible.
2) The gameplay is very annoying sometimes; glitched animals that even run to a ravine and fall.... weird....; getting stuck in the corners so u have to restart the game; animals that dont move at all. When u poses different animals sometimes you have no idea what to do, how they work. If the wolf falls even from a little height it restarts from the savepoint so is really frustrating when u just want to run and run at hight speed and jump everywhere (like you do in games like Okami). All these glitches makes you fell that this game wasnt very polished
3) The voice acting is very good, is not excellent but it works.
4) The music is nice but it doesnt go ""with you"" and your journey. In games like ABZU or Journey you are surrounded by music all the time that makes everything better, it makes you feel different emotions, moving you, making you happy or sad. In this game the music is just there just to not be silent, it doesnt make you any company through the way.
5) The landscapes are beatiful but there are like ""too big"" for nothing, most of the places you explore dont have anything so u waste a lot of time thinking you are gonna find something where there is nothing.

I dont like to ""not recommend"" a game, because I know there is a lot of hard work behind, I believe they have a great idea but the developers failed tremendously. Im sorry but I cant recommend this game, it turns repetitive , frustrating and boring as u progress in it. If you have some money to waste, wait for a sale and try it but still.... the experience might not be what u were expecting."

Lost Ember is an absolutely stunning 5-15 hour hour game, the music is top-notch and the graphics are incredible. The story was fun, interesting, curious, and heart-wrenching and it’s everything I knew it would be after watching the trailer. Enter and explore a huge Fantasy world that was abandoned and destroyed by greed, vengeance, grief, and the natural passage of time.
Uncover lost memories, discover who you truly are, and help the lost soul – and yourself – journey to the final resting place of nearly every soul, The City of Light.

A lot of how I feel about this game thus far has already been touched on by others, but I want to write my own review.

I bought this game lured in by the beautiful art style and interesting concept. On those fronts: this game does not disappoint. It truly is a beautiful game with a great soundtrack that is soothing to listen to while exploring the landscape and inhabiting the bodies of numerous different animals.

Where this game comes undone is the very needless voice acting implemented into the spirit you are for some reason obligated to help and follow. This game doesn't need obvious exposition in the background explaining long, drawn out cutscenes that frankly, don't really need to exist. However, the story seems to revolve around finding these plumes of smoke, then howling to uncover these memories.

This game has the capacity to be truly memorable experience. If only the story was more challenging, enabling you to slowly uncover your history: finding amulets/trinkets and objects that trigger memories by overcoming obstacles and puzzles. Rather than running to plumes of smoke and being subjected to the obnoxiously long and frequent cutscenes. I HATED the cut scenes after only playing for shy of an hour. They interrupted game play and slowed things down painfully, whilst having to listen to the little pommy orb explain things that were very apparent.
All I wanted was to run around as a wolf and enjoy the landscape, or fly around as a bird ducking and weaving around obstacles.

If you want a game that is visually stunning and relaxing - this game is for you.
If you're looking for a game with a challenge or a story open to interpretation - then sadly, like me; this game isn't really for you.

I really hope the developers update this game and help it live up to its' potential."

WARNING: MILD SPOILERS

Allow me to start by saying that based off the trailer, I thought I would be getting a game like Journey/Abzu. My expectations were not so much a story and more-so a captivating visual experience. If you set your expectations to games such as Journey or Abzu, expect to be disappointed. I'm about to be a huge snob in this review, but I hardly ever write reviews. I'm writing this review as a warning, and a bit of venting.

First, I'll start with the story and the way it's presented. The story frankly, in my opinion is rather meh. It's not terrible, but it's nothing innovative. I feel like I would have liked the story more, had the game NOT STOPPED ME EVERY TEN SECONDS to dump dozens of minutes of dialogue onto my head. The amount of times cutscenes and story break up gameplay, I wondered if they should have just made a movie instead of an actual game. The longest times I had between cutscenes were the times I got lost. The cutscenes alone are not even remotely worth the screen time they're given. They consist of red statues occasionally moving, occasionally speaking, and in general are just super boring to watch while a monotone narrator gushes dialogue. I wish instead of taking control away from the character, the game would slow you down, enable the scenes, and let you walk around inside them. But they don't do this, you're forced to watch still frames for however long the narrator cares to speak. Granted, some cutscenes needed to focus as some details were too difficult to see from far away, but the amount of times I was taken out of the game and placed back in it was genuinely frustrating. You could hardly go entire minutes without being stopped forced to watch a cutscene. I looked it up, and with my total playtime of 4.4 hours (1:00:00 of which was me AFK), the game has 1:36:08 of cutscenes. That's insane.

Second, soundtrack. Where is this soundtrack everyone is hyped about? Did something break in my playthrough? I've heard the same handful of walking songs the entire playthrough. Sometimes there was just dead air, nothing but the wind. The part that stuck out to me the most was when you'd run into a flock of birds and they'd all fly away in this spectacular cloud of wild animals. There is zero musical build-up to this moment. You sprint down a hill, your heart thinks ""Oh here it comes!"" and when you do it, you do it, but the music is nonexistent. Your only music is the wind ambiance in your ear. The game trailer's song is what captivated me, yet we never hear it in game, and the only thing we get close to it is at the end of the game.

Finally, visuals. I really don't see what I'm supposed to be seeing that's so breath-taking. Sure, there are a few moments: flock of parrots, the sandstorm, and a few buildings/fields. But the part that made me the saddest, was that I hardly ever got to experience the scenery. In every zone you go into, the game physically grabs your camera and shoves it into the air screaming ""LOOK HOW NICE THIS LOOKS!!!"". Yes, Lost Ember, it looks great, now PLEASE let me see it for myself. Outside of certain moments, you're going to be looking at a lot of dirt, grass, and brick. Abzu comes to mind when I think of how a game captivates the player with scenery. Lost Ember feels like it only has certain moments of this, and everything else blends together and is rather dull. Nothing grabbed me. Nothing said, ""explore me"". Every area that whispered hopes of exploration were short lived and resulted in a collectible item in a drab location.

I apologize for so much negativity, but damn I wanted to like this game. The only reason I finished it was because I accidentally AFK’ed past the 2-hour limit on Steam refunds. I was ready to call it quits by Chapter 4. I can't help but feel like I've missed a key feature in this game. What am I missing? What did I do wrong?"

I love ancient civilizations, the architecture, the culture and even though I do not believe in any form of afterlife and consider myself a logical person, I absolutely love and admire the look ancient civilizations had on spiritual afterlife, throw in those elements from real life ancient civilizations and you get the games unique own little story of Kalani in an magnificent ancient civilization and its downfalls. Now aside from my love of ancient civilizations, mainly Egyptian, more on the game itself. I really enjoyed Kalani's story. I was invested into it the entire way and loved the journey. I can't help but admire people who happen on a righteous journey of revolution and search for the truth. While I find downfalls of civilizations very sad, I do love the wilderness combined with the trip to the past of the said ancient civilization, when you explore what they left behind, the architecture. The atmosphere in the game is amazing, makes you really enjoy every moment of your experience. I really like the idea of controlling multiple different animals to deal with different challenges and pass through different areas and I feel like they nailed on the selection of animals, I really liked how unusual many of the animals in the game were. Out of every animal, birds were the greatest experience to play as, flying has always been something I've wished to be able to do out of will, I love the feeling of freedom you get when you're up in the limitless sky, the views you have and can't forget the night sky and the stars that you're the closest to up in the sky. I just loved that the game gave me a little bit of that feeling I grave for from flying. A few flaws would only be how the game was built, so if you really go out your way to glitch out, you'll run into glitches and while collectibles are usually enjoyable for completionists, they made enjoying the games atmosphere a bit more difficult at times and the only real way to completely emerge yourself into the game is to just play and enjoy the story first, forget about collectibles and if you really wish, search for them afterwards. Essentially the game combined everything I love, amazing ancient civilizations and a journey of someone from such a civilization, nature and wilderness, sky and the stars and the magic of spiritual afterlife."

Lost Ember is a game where I struggle to understand the Very Positive rating. It's not a terrible game, but it just isn't worth the time either. The animal switching is the only interesting mechanic, but they don't give you a good reason to use them all, if there is a hummingbird in any given area, you are going to be the hummingbird. This is because the other glaring issue is the vast emptiness that makes up many of the areas, there isn't a quick way to traverse them unless you fly, and the only reason to traverse them in the first place is because somewhere they hid a collectible mushroom in the middle of said emptiness, and not in a place that ""feels"" like a collectible should be in. All this combined with a mediocre story make Lost Ember a game that isn't bad or ugly, just one that is a bore, and falls short of it's potential."

I'm not going to lie, the ending did make me cry a little bit.

Although the story is emotionally quite complicated , it still definitely got to me to see the lost ember start to slowly understand wolf's side of the story.

The soundtrack and the game were absolutely gorgeous. I have been looking forward to buying this game for months now, and it finally went on sale so I purchased it. It did live up to the hype I built up for myself prior to purchasing it, and I would absolutely recommend to anyone who wants an adventure game that is extremely unique to most anything else you have played before.

It is a very special game, but it does have some downsides I was not anticipating (and I am a very easy-to-please person):
I walked/flew/ran through the landscape into nothingness more times than I can count.


Overall, I would highly recommend this game. It's long, beautiful, quite relatable , and I most enjoyed being able to play as so many different animals. For the most part, it is an intuitive game and not overly complicated. There are tons of collectibles and achievements to unlock. I just finished my first playthrough and I only focused on the plot, but I do intend to go back through each chapter of the game to try to complete all of the achievements as well."

(Review rewritten after recent play through)

I really wanted to love this game. Typically, exploratory adventures with beautiful scenery are my cup of tea. On my first attempt, I played for 3 hours before my frustration outweighed the fun factor. I initially approached the game planning to find most collectibles (around 200) which put me searching at the boundaries of the environment and experiencing the worst of the interface issues (wonky controls and 'soft' boundaries that your character falls through or gets permanently stuck in).

After playing Spirit of the North, I decided to retry Lost Ember and ignored collectibles and achievements. In this mode, the game is a fairly linear walking simulator with a wolf as the main character. It has a sweet story, beautiful landscapes, good music, and the twist of inhabiting various animals as you make your way (fish to swim, birds to fly, mountain goats to climb, etc.). Just playing the story resulted in me finding a fraction of the collectibles and only 12 out of 33 achievements. BUT, it was an enjoyable experience. The story is one of redemption and forgiveness and is narrated by the wolf's spirit companion, with cut scenes that provide memory flashbacks. At times, these cut scenes are quite lengthy.

So, having tried the game again and playing through to the end (about an 8 hour run without peeking at a walkthroughs), I would recommend this game to adventurers who like an exploratory narrative that does not require platforming skills.

However, players need to be aware of some game play issues. You will regularly find yourself permanently embedded in a wall, a rock or cliff face. While not a true bug, it is very disconcerting and does not help with navigating. Extricating yourself often requires either possessing another nearby animal or restarting from the last checkpoint. Your field of view is somewhat limited so you don't really have a chance to take in the whole of the scenery to get a point of reference on where you have been and where you need to go next. I played with a keyboard and mouse and the controls often get unpredictable and overly-reactive, especially in flight or when trying to make a tight turn. While these issues are not deal-breakers, they do detract from the overall game experience."

I enjoy the mechanic of changing into different animals. Trying to gather all of the collectibles is a nightmare but if you go through the game without worrying about the collectibles then it's a nice experience. I feel it starts off a little slow but the story starts to build up and become more interesting. Overall I think it's a pretty game with a beautiful story."

Yes, this game is visually stunning, but the visuals are the only redeeming factor. My immersion is broken when animal models get stuck inside walls or spin in circles, and many animals feel like their natural movements are restricted for 'game balance'. Bird's can't fly, they can only glide, fish can't turn quickly or stay near the top of a body of water, and the hummingbird can only fly in one orthogonal direction at a time. There are bugs throughout the game, causing me to lose hours of progress when the wolf clipped into a wall during deposess and could not get out, or posess nearby creatures.

The story is boring and narrated by a disembodied, painfully British accent that explains everything to the player as if he or she was a small child. It completely forgets the 'show, don't tell' rule of writing. The collectibles are just there for achievement hunters, and although the landscape was beautiful it did not take long to become bored of solving all of the game's mini-puzzles and realize that there was no point to the game."

I backed this project on Kickstarter in 2016, so after such a long wait... I guess all I can say is what a disappointment. Considering how long it was pushed back, I was really hoping for more out of it. The animal graphics are cute, but the rest of the game has about as much detail as games from the early 2000s. Far too polygonal and a let down after all the build up. The story never really grabbed me, I didn't care about the characters. It's really just a cute walking simulator with nice music and retro graphics. Being a completionist, I hate leaving anything undone. The fact that I couldn't backtrack even a short way, and the story is completely and totally linear was a serious problem because I couldn't go back and pick up any of the ridiculous amount of collectibles. I honestly wanted to like this game, but in hindsight I definitely wouldn't pay for it."

The world needs more creature games!

I absolutely loved this game, though I'll only play the ending sparingly because it hits me right in the feels. THE FEELS, MAN! T^T

Parts of it felt similar to Flower or ABZÛ, either in level design, aesthetic, or gameplay, but Lost Ember has a LOT more story, plot, dialogue, feels, DID I MENTION THE FEELS? I started playing around noon and spent the next 10 hours playing through the entire thing. I just couldn't put it down.

If this review seems incoherent, it's because I just finished that 10 hour session, sorta finished crying, and probably need sleep but need to cheer up a bit before I can do that. Soon... Soon I shall sleep... And probably roll around as a wombat some more tomorrow. ^^

Anyway, yes, 9/10. More creature games, plz."

This game is very good, from the storytelling to the world around you. However, there are some major flaws that i'd like to point out immediately.
- I bugged the red orb at the beginning of the game so i lost him for a good bit, literally just by sticking my head in a wall.
- One of the animals can literally levitate around the map. you gain access to it at the beginning of the game.
- The game has some ""quick-time"" events which aren't challenging at all and mainly just serve as cutscenes.
- The levels are WAY too big for the little amount of exploration this game pushes you to do.

With that out of the way, let me just say. This game was absolutely fantastic. From the visuals to the story, this game was AMAZING all the way through (minus the bugs.) The story still sticks with me to this day, the music and OST is some of the best I've heard in a very long time, and it definitely fits the environments you'll be playing through if you decide to pick the game up. The OST is instrumental, though.

TL;DR: game good, minor bugs that stick out after first playthrough, good ost.

Would I recommend this game? yes.
MAYBE pick it up on sale if you're unsure, sale price is $20 iirc."

What a beautiful, emotive game! The graphics are gorgeous, the scenery is lovely & the music fits in perfectly with the ambience. I genuinely had so much fun & loved every minute of it.

A melancholic story is slowly revealed through past memories that you uncover through each chapter. The main themes circle around loss, repentance, & the deep, soul-wrenching remorse you are inadvertently gifted with after irreversible decisions. The road to hell is paved with good intentions, as they say... I even ended up shedding a few tears at the ending.

Note: If you're a bit of a terrain wanderer like myself, you'll possibly encounter some bugs getting stuck in between tight places that likely weren't meant to be scaled over. Don't panic & just restart at the last check point! (After this happened a few times I learned not to climb over EVERYTHING I see LOL)"

You can play as a baby duckling. 10/10

On a more serious note, this is an impressive debut game from a small team of developers. Featuring gorgeous imagery, lots of cute animals, a lovely soundtrack and an emotional story. I was a backer in the Kickstarter campaign, spent years waiting for the game and the final result did not disappoint.

You play - mostly - as a wolf who is called upon by a mysterious spirit. Your task is to find out what happened in your past. As the game is fairly short, to say any more than that would be getting into spoilers.
Suffice to say that along the way you will need to ""possess"" many different kinds of animals to navigate the obstacles in your path. Dig into underground tunnels as a mole, soar into the skies as a hummingbird or parrot, swim upstream as a fish, climb mountains as a goat and much more. While I was aware of many animals that were going to be featured in the game (many of them stretch goals during the campaign), the amount of variety in the final game still managed to impress.

As of writing this, the game has only been out for a couple of days and there are still quite a few bugs to be ironed out. Fell through the map a few times and occasionally got stuck in the landscape, forcing me to restart from a checkpoint. Thankfully, checkpoints are ample and usually only a minute or two of progress was lost.

Highly recommended if you love relaxing games and/or cute, cuddly animals."
lost+ember,Recommended,7.6,"Posted: June 26, 2021
Having backed this game on Kickstarter years ago, I've finally finished it and decided to write a review. It's a very beautiful game that knows its style and theme well - definite inspirations from Journey, and sequences in the gameplay reminded me of ABZÛ - I would like to cover my thoughts on each element in an ascending order of positivity, so as to try and break negativity bias. Bear in mind I did not think any particular element was overall ""bad"", so to speak, so the lowest point is still mixed. There are things I liked and disliked about most elements.

The controls - I found the controls strange at times. Input and movement feels floaty, but I actually think that particular bit contributes to the overall smoothness of the gameplay, and being able to relax while you move and view the scenery. However, certain animals didn't help with maintaining that - many required constant and repetitive input to keep a good speed or altitude, particularly birds and fish. Holding the spacebar would be a much more desirable option for certain controls rather than having to tap it repeatedly. The camera has an extremely strange acceleration curve - Moving the mouse at a medium speed orbits the camera fastest, but if you go faster with it the camera input slows down heavily. I am still not sure if this is a technical or stylistic issue. When I did want to experiment or investigate in terms of movement, the floaty controls and strange camera movement were a disadvantage. The camera often clips into walls and terrain. Sometimes the out-of-bounds recovery system sticks you into an endless loop of falling, and once I even got into a falling loop outside of the map, and loading the checkpoint shoved me all the way back to the start of the game. Thankfully I was able to load my save and it put me back at the right location.

The story - Even though the story is perfectly acceptable, the way it was told irked me at times, primarily the monologue from the Companion. I feel like the story in general could have been told a lot more visually (though certain world-building elements might have to be simplified for that) - There were many times when the Companion made an exclamation or commented on something that I thought was perfectly obvious from the visuals onscreen. Unfortunately most of the story is this way, and I more often found myself getting the most emotional when there were no voices, and the sweeping music and unique visuals could take over. The ending is another thing, however - Absolutely worth working through the rest of it. The sequence at the end moved me very heavily.

The gameplay - Moving around vast landscapes and switching between animals is well-done and each animal has its own unique abilities and movement. I felt some animals were developer jokes (the caterpillar and the tortoise in particular), but they contributed to the tone of the game and kept things light. I feel like many animals could have been fleshed out more, particularly with more animations. Locating the right animal for the right location and just exploring areas in general and seeing how they connect was very rewarding, particularly with the collectible mechanics in place. I did spend a lot of time combing over large areas but still did not find a good chunk of things in the end. It was hard to tell consistently where something might be hidden, which I suppose is part of the exploration fun.

The sound/music - My only gripes with the sound design is that sometimes it was spatialized strangely, like it was jumping around between far and near and not being consistent, or that when the Companion spoke at certain times it was drowned out by other effects, or was very faint because the camera was far away from him, especially in camera cutscenes. I could control and still hear myself walking around during the credits. The sound design in general was good. Voice acting could have been better; I will reiterate this could have been alleviated with purely visual storytelling.
An impressive soundtrack maintains ambiance through various levels. Sometimes the themes became a little repetitive when I was in the same area for long. I had to draw out the condor flight at the end because I wanted to hear the full vocal song. Perhaps I had flown the first sections too fast. The soundtrack itself is excellent, it dances through lots of different themes and tones.

The artstyle - Lost Ember knows its artstyle well. All creatures were consistent with each other. The terrain was simple yet effective, and very fantastical at times, with caves and holes in rolling mountains, spires, beautiful water features and recognizable landmarks in areas to help navigate. Building and ruin design was also good, with large and small structures. The cutscenes and memories were also simple yet effective, and the storyboard-like telling of them simulated memories quite well, I thought.

Overall - Be willing to put up with a few hiccups in terms of controls and storytelling, but I certainly recommend this game for its relaxing tone, unique artwork, beautiful music, and the more emotional beats of the story."

It's okay.
Don't get me wrong, it's absolutely gorgeous with stunning visuals and a heartfelt story to go along with it, but this doesn't feel like a game. It feels like it was meant to be a film instead.

The animations are smooth and satisfying, but the movement feels awkward at times. There are plenty of bugs for you to explore as well. The gameplay feels boring the majority of the ""game."" Either you're watching a cutscene that seems like forever or trying to recover from a game-breaking glitch.
I expected much more from a game like this and I feel like this wasn't worth nearly $30.

TL;DR:
This is quite an atmospheric adventure game, with great visuals, amazing soundtrack and a touching story.

I can't really say much of this game (since that would spoil you the story) except it is a a great experience to be had. The gameplay is simplistic and does the job. It consist of navigating the world and uncover your past from region to region and by ""possessing"" other animals.

The only irritants would be the many OPTIONAL collectibles in this game, scattered in the many places. The good thing though, is the game is divided in chapters so you can always reload past progress and find them all! The other complaint could be the game length. I did find it a tad too long but the finale is pretty good."

TL;DR: The art and music are amazing. However, it does not make up for the cringeworthy storywriting, pacing, and the frustratingly limited freedom to explore. Art/Audio=10/10. Writing/Mechanics=5/10.

The good:
I'd followed it for awhile and was very excited to play it. Starting the game felt like a plunge into an immersive world, with the art and music adding amazing depth. I laughed out loud when I morphed into the lil furry ball of fluff that is the wombat and munched snacks. The action was pointless to the overall goal of the story, but I didn't care. I was a lil ball of fluff. I was certainly going to act like it. Unfortunately, this is where everything went downhill.

The bad and the ugly:
Following the small opening moments, I discovered that there was very little else I could do as the wombat, and I chalked it up to being in the tutorial area of the game. Hoping to see more and encounter more animals to tinker with, I trotted out to the open field and started exploring. I soon discovered that there were severe limitations on my exploration and capabilities. The ducks could only fly a small distance over land and water, the wombats had no other actions other than munching on what looked like blue pebbles (which, without any real clarification, boggles my mind. what wombat eats rocks?), and the hummingbirds just existed. There were several times when, in my efforts to explore, I got stuck in the environment so much that I had to consider whether I wanted to struggle some more or close the game and make my way over the terrain once again.

I really wanted to like this game. I wanted to like it so much that I endured the mechanics, hoping the story would distract me enough so I could do what Bethesda normally does and call it a feature instead of an issue or a bug. I could not have been more wrong. I want to emphasize that, after of gameplay, I could not bear to play another second. The frustration with the restrictions in movement and actions as each animal, combined with the spirit commentary was too much to bear, and I immediately stopped playing the game. While I'm certain the overall plot of the game is amazing, the spirit commentary and pacing prevent it from truly shining."

I was thinking, if I should write this review in german or english. Because you will notice that my english isn't the best at all. But I want to recommand this game to as much people as possible. That's why you read this review in english.

I was waiting for the game to be released for more than three and a half years... And when it finally got released I was completly happy. Just to realize that I won't get enough time to enjoy the game with all the calm it deserved.
Everytime I was able to spend more than one our in the game, I was doing it. And I could never wait to play it again.

They said during the development: ""we all had the same vision for our future: working in our own, independent studio on our own game. Something different, something new, something that would not only entertain, but fire up emotions.""
And first I thought: ""Oh well... Nice goal but fire up emotions isn't that easy. But..nevermind I am going to try to enjoy the game as it stands""
But after finishing the story (no not the game), I am able to say: ""congratulations to the developer. You've reached everything you wanted.""

Lost Ember is a game that's perfect for people, that doesn't have that much time to spend in a game but nevertheless want to have a perfect game.
The idea of just discover a world full of memories and emotions with different animals is just genius. You get different kind of views and it's just gorgeous. I even start to sthink about how other animals think about thei kind of view (this turtle just killed me xD).
However... just a genius idea isn't enough to make a game perfect.

But with a beautiful soundtrack and breathtaking artstyle and enviromente you are going to love this atmosphere. It just catches you.
I could try to write even more about this game, although you get my point: I can only worship this game.

I want to recommand this to everyone who is able to appreciate this game.
And who is able to appreciate the game?
-Someone who loves to discover.
-achievmenthunter in a calming world.
-someone who want to have some variety in a game (and maybe loves to fly)
-someone who lay an eye on the story
-someone who doesn't have any problem with shorter game
-yeah maybe even little graphic and soundtrack lover
-someone who don't need much action and would also enjoy a interactiv movie.

Well at all... I hope you are going to love that game. But you have to be ready for a calming and discovering game.

I hope I could help you in any way.
Have a nice day.

Good effort to the studio for a first game, but the pricing of 30euro for a game with enough blatant issues to kill the whole experience is disappointing. I don't quite get the buzz around this game.

Apart from a gameplay that allows you to incarnate different animals that truly felt refreshing, the magic only laster for half an hour before the bugs and glitches started to pile up and ruing the game.

About the story, the lore of Lost Ember felt like some reheated lost civilization storyline that lacks depth with some spirituality clumsily thrown into the scenario in a beautiful dystopian world that lack some coherence overall.

Paying the full price for this game felt like i've been ripped off. Don't get me wrong, i'm happy to contribute to game developpers to encourage them but 30euros for what felt like a beta version after 2 hours in the game didn't feel good. See below for a list of issue i noticed from one hour of gameplay, the game clearly lacked some further beta testing (or budget cut?).

I hope the game will get some good patches and improvement before more people get in it. I am not sure i would even finish the game after all the issues i encountered ruined the fun.

List of issues:
- the random freezes,
- glitches that let you see through walls when you are a hummingbird in a tunnel
- unrealistic physics, e.g. the dirt piles you find in the tunnels that you can ""pierce"", because doing so makes no sound it is like a random pile of ghastly weightless dirt that you push away without any environmental sound or cue.
- the narrative is plain and somehow he talks to the wolf knowing who she was and some other time adressing her as a total stranger with no clue about history or environment (ok i understand this is to explain to the player, but it feels very incoherent)
- glitches after transitions that need you to reload from last save to get out of (i.e.: *right after making the pillar drop and before the hummingbird rush part, i couldn't move, my character (wolf or mole) was not on screen, the camera locked on a dirt pile, and pressing B would prompt the ""hold to skip""... totally random)"

Beautiful environment, concept art, story, music, sound-design, but as far as gameplay go.

- mole, get stuck inside a wall, can literally not move, okay I guess,
- duck, constantly crash in to random skyboxes, can literally not fly higher than 10inches off the ground.

You should enjoy exploring the levels, but instead you need to constantly think about the game limitations and move accordingly, which doesn't make for a very fun or relaxing game."

I really wanted to give this game a positive review. Nothing story-wise is really that bad. The core mechanic of possessing other creatures was fine, the music was good, the story was alright at best. Portions of the terrain were beautifully crafted. Very lore-dense.

But there were times in the game where I was completely bored out of my mind or stuck on a certain section, trying to find out where to go with no help. Times I would get lost completely and when I reloaded from a checkpoint, it just teleported me to a place I've never been before. I would randomly phase through terrain, sometimes getting stuck. If you hit the checkpoints or memories in the wrong order it would reset your progress to that point.

Some people complain about the narration, but I didn't think it was that bad. Is it worth the $30? Probably not."

A little buggy/laggy at times, but nothing that doesn't fix itself (and that isn't amusing, in the case of bugs), and that does basically nothing to detract from how I'd score this game:
The story is in some ways a little predictable, but absolutely beautifully told nonetheless, the soundtrack is gorgeous and the art style and world design is lovely! Collectables encourage you to explore but never force you to, so you can either play the game just for the story and experience without having to worry about walls needing X many of Y collectable, or go searching for them and enjoy the scenery at your own pace.

The game is ok in my opinion, which is surprising given that it is Kickstarted and is the first game this studio has released. The story is fair with both depth and holes, the visuals nice, the game-play kindof lack luster imo. But what really nagged at me was the narrator’s voice. For some reason it kept taking me out and sounded out of place but I could not figure out why, usually I love British narrators. It wasn’t till days after I’d completed the game with my mind chewing on that conundrum that it finally hit me. My subconscious must have been screaming at me that this was someone I knew and this was not how they should be acting. This explains ALL of the problems I had with the narrator and I’m amazed it took me so long to place it.
Unfortunately, I’m certain I’ll never be able to seriously replay the game again with that connection in my head as I’ll never be able to take the narrator seriously."

If you played Abzu or Journey this will be right up your alley. Albeit a bit more vocal and story focused.

Lots of beautiful scenery and vista to take in, it is quite the long journey to partake in.

The wolf is a little on the low polygon/texture side, kind of off and stiff. I have maxed out graphic setting. But its minor thing as the environment is the main draw of the game.

You will be possessing other animal to traverse the world, which I find keeps the pacing fresh.

If focusing on the story the playtime is quite short. There is however a lot of collectible and hidden area for you to explore."

What starts as a typical trope, ends up being the foundation set for a rather amazing story, all while ensuring you get to laugh, be in jaw-dropping awe and have your moments of sadness and redemption.

Lost Ember takes you on the journey of a spirit finding its memory, and it is interwoven with decent lore and an awesome mechanic-- soul jumping, which allows you to jump from animal to animal to progress the story in different ways. In good taste, the game allows you to explore areas in different ways, mostly allowing you to decide whether you waddle, run, fly or even dig. In some cases, the animal mechanic feels forced, but it doesn't detract from the story.

The latter part of the game really opens up into amazing vistas, picturesque scenes of flying with flocks of birds, and even getting a chuckle with some internet-popularized animals. In this, alongside the story itself, the game ensures that you feel the entire breadth of your emotional spectrum, and it plays it just as well as the soundtrack itself (highly recommended it is purchased!).

While the game takes its time to find its legs and get you moving in the right direction, the persistence pays off, and you can find yourself through the grand story in about five hours time, unless you go hunting for some other things. To that end, there is the ability to hunt for different fauna, but it seems to be a mechanic that will draw you into exploring the map, but it does not offer any bonus to the gameplay itself. I would sooner have skipped it were I not a completionist.

Lost Ember has found its way into my heart, and while it does not have high replay value, for the price and the experience, I'd definitely give it a 9 out of 10."

If it wasn't obvious from the trailer, the game is very much a walking simulator. I've never played a game of this genre before, but I walked in with an open mind.

I'll start with the elephant in the room, the visuals in the game really are astonishing. I often found losing myself to some of areas the game has to offer. But I don't think it's fair to not mention that there also were areas where all of this was greatly lacking as well.

The mechanic of possessing animals to progress the game is such a great idea, but I really think the developers criminally underutilized this mechanic. It was very common to possess an animal just to go through a doorway and then change back to Wolf form for faster travel. I know the game is a walking simulator, but they really could've been a ton more creative with this mechanic and it's sad to see it being at the state it is when it has such good potential.

Storywise, I can definitely see where they were going with it. It sounds amazing on paper, but not as easy to convey on a game like this. In the end I think it was okay, but it does have a fair share of stumbles on the way.

I think the way they designed the characters in memories was great and unique, but their decision to not animate them and instead go with poses that slowly fade out into a new pose really pulled me off from the experience. I don't know if this was because of the budget or a creative choice, but it really affected the ability to display emotions the characters were going through.

Some of the other things that could've been better was the general sound design and voice acting. The latter was alright in my books, but I think they really struggled to convey the emotions of the characters on some of the more emotional parts of the story.

Now let's get to the more negative parts of the game.
The camera and controls were very noticeably terrible and caused constant frustration from the start till the end. The last quarter of the game really came off as very rushed to me and started to pull me from the game. But most notably the game really lacks the polishing it needs.

In the end, the game is okay-ish.
Sadly the positives cannot carry the game further than that with all the negatives weighing it down. But they have enough stopping power from letting the game slip into the bad category.
I can forgive some of the slips because of the measly 326k budget (not to say that there weren't some things they could've improved with little to no change in that) and the fact that this was the first game from the studio. With a bigger budget and improvements on their shortcomings they could definitely create really amazing games.

I'll be keeping an eye on their further releases and hopefully they can deliver a better game in the future."

Very beautiful game with an interesting story line and fun mechanics. I was a little surprised that I finished it in 5 hours but I don't regret the purchase at all! Well done :)"

Finally a game that feels fresh again.

I've Kickstarted this game a few years ago and it was the right thing to do. Beautiful visuals, interesting story and it's fun to explore the different animals."

Beautiful game. Great music, great story and being able to change into all kinds of different animals is really cool. Just be prepared to search EVERY nook & cranny in order to find all of the collectibles."

8/10 for Graphics, Sound, Story. When you fly as the Condor into the Sky, that part did give me chills.

4/10 Gameplay. 5hours of gameplay for 25 quid...very expensive and incredibly linear.

I don't know, I just wish there was way more to the game."

The game is absolutely beautiful - the art's breathtaking, the landscapes are vast, and the memories have a wonderful art style evoking a unique culture.

...But, while it has some fun movement, the game is more or less a walking simulator, moving between stations of cutscenes, meaning it must carry itself entirely on its art and story. While the story has some promise, it is largely delivered via poorly-written exposition dump. The voice actor for your expository partner is fine, and the dialogue fits for a relatively modern, down-to-earth portrayal. ...but the accent (British, maybe?) doesn't remotely fit the setting, and there's little of the enchanting mysticism or folklorish quality that everything else about the game seems designed to evoke to your magical spirit companion having the voice and vocabulary of a guy you met down at the pub.

It has some promise, and few individual aspects are really done badly. However, some poor, conflicting choices make it very difficult to get invested in what the game should sell itself on."

I don't get where the love is coming from for this game. It's not particularly beautiful or deep - it's tedious, awkward, passive and repetitive. All you do is run around this world watching a story unfold (you take no action but just watch passively). The story doesn't make much sense. To explore you can zap yourself into different animals and each has its own abilities, but most are pretty underwhelming and the controls are awkward - be prepared to get stuck in rocks and bushes a lot. You can collect some stuff you find, but for what? Just for the sake of collecting, there's nothing to do with them. And this dot of light that you follow also is a one-way relationship - you can's talk or interact with it. This really seems like half a game. Where's the other half, for the money I paid?"

One of a few games that could be really good if you only stripped all story, cutscenes and VA from it. Being able to control and move around as different animals is very fun and luckily a large part of the game, though after a short while you'd experience everything and have to progress the story for more entertainment. Speaking of which, the story and its messaging is absolutely abhorrent and excusing abuse, which for a cutesy animal game is very jarring. Cutscenes are uninspiring and the VA I just couldn't stand anymore half way through and turned it off. Can still be enjoyable for people that are able to distance themselves from story, but for people like me, that want a story to either make sense or not be there, it's one of the worst games I ever played and the bad taste it left behind will not go away any time soon."

Very good, but a bit ... janky.

Lost Ember is obviously a gorgeous game, with colourful and beautiful environments, stylized (and cute) creature designs and wonderfully fitting music. It tells its story visually through the journey you go on as a spindly-legged wolf, but also via narration by your British orb companion, and while the voice acting isn't bad, I'd probably recommend turning it off - it's more interesting to piece things together for yourself instead of having someone tell you everything, although your mileage may vary.
Either way the story is one with emotional highs and lows and some not-too-surprising revelations.

Generally, the movement feels fluid and it's very enjoyable to run or fly or swim around, as one of the main mechanics of the game is to take over other animals you find and make use of their specific characteristics.
On the other hand, there's also a chance you'll get stuck in places. I once found myself flailing and splashing in the corner of a small pool with no way to get out except by reloading a checkpoint. (Granted, checkpoints are frequent enough, so it's not a major issue, but I also had to do that occasionally when I turned back into a wolf in inconvenient places.)

There's a bit more jank as well.
The animations - especially for the wolf, which you'll likely spend most of your time as, or at least I did - are a bit off, mostly when turning or stopping since the latter has your current animal simply freeze in place.
Sometimes the camera works against you, gets into walls or the ceiling or so close that you can hardly tell what you're doing anymore.
Several ducks I found had forgotten how to duck, meaning they were standing at the bottom of lakes and rivers, at least one fish decided it didn't like being underwater anymore and simply sat - motionless - on the shore, and there was one goat suspended in mid-air, mid-jump.
During one sequence that was otherwise utterly beautiful - like the rest of the game - the music faded in and out for reasons I couldn't discern.
None of these are major issues, but I found them and other little things to be noticeable and, for lack of a better term, a bit immersion-breaking, especially considering how much the game drew me in and kept me engaged overall.

There are collectibles, mainly relics which can give some additional information about the world and setting, but also different kinds of mushrooms and specific animals.
(I couldn't tell you whether finding all of any of these adds anything other than completion since I missed a good chunk of them; might well go back to try and get them since it's very fun and relaxing to simply explore.)

A little bit of jank shouldn't deter anyone from playing such a wonderful game so I 100% recommend it."

The game has some pretty scenes in the first half but it is a very subpar gaming experience. Over the few hours I ran into invisible walls, getting suck in a rock, aggressive negating of big jumps even though npc animals can make it, a restart checkpoint in chapter 5 that sent me to chapter 1, a restart that at least placed me in the right level but did not spawn the necessary animal to make it over the next obstacle (I thought it was the hardest puzzle in the game and in a way it was).

Spoilery stuff

The second half is a straight line moving experience through bare environments. One segment had a pop song as you press forward like it was Metal Gear Solid 3 but it was completely unearned by the bland game. The game expect you to find mushrooms and relics but when the level involves trudging through snow at 0 miles an hour, it's a big ask. Another segment slowly reveals a massive scaffolding setting up a jumping puzzle many stories tall... all for you to crawl in a hole to the next area instead.

The game uses an Incan vibe to tell their simplistic tale of revolution, tragedy, and understanding but the main voice of the game is a British bloke. He's all ""ello guv' me needs tuh find me City o' Light watcher oi cor blimey!"" One of the reveals at the end is that this British ball of light who needs to find his way is the titular ""Lost Ember."" Holy ssss really?!?!? Not me, a wolf? And the chap can ffff right off with his condemnation of the main character in the mid-game, though his real identity (the only other named character in the flashbacks) makes the ssss he gives make sense in hindsight."

I can safely say that this game is one that everyone should play. This game is stunning, the graphics and colors are superb, and the controls or very smooth. The different animals you play all are unique and the landscape changes frequently so it's not the same boring place as you progress. You can tell a lot of thought was put into everything. Words do not do it justice."
