Have you ever noticed how, in a typical RPG (and, now that I think about it, most games in general) battles don’t really mean anything? How many times have you defeated a miniboss, only to have it stand back up and laugh at you, saying “I have underestimated you! You are a worthy opponent! This is not the end! We shall meet again!” and make a getaway? Think about it. How many times do you beat up Balrog in Cave Story only to have him fly away without a scratch? How is Black Knight able to keep running away after Shovel Knight stabs the hell out of him? How come you black out if you lose a Pokémon battle, but none of the other trainers do? And how does the big bad villain always seem to get away, even if their HP hits zero, so they can reappear in the sequel?

Undertale asks the question, “What if defeating an enemy in battle always means that they die?”

This might seem quite inconsequential in random encounters, but Undertale will also pit you against several main characters. If you defeat a main character in battle, they’re dead for good, and the whole story changes to reflect it. Heavy stuff.

But thankfully, as the game advertises, you don’t actually have to kill anyone! The game offers a second option to get out of battles: talking the enemy out of fighting. This involves solving a simple puzzle, almost always involving the “Act” menu in battle. The puzzle changes depending on what kind of enemy you’re fighting; sometimes you’ll just need to give them a compliment, other times you’ll need to survive several of their attacks, and so on. Once they’re not emotionally invested in the battle anymore, you can “spare” them, and the battle ends. You won’t get any EXP for it, but you’ll still get gold. It’s a very unique fighting mechanic!

I admit, after my first playthrough of the game, I was disappointed in the story’s presentation. I thought that both the very beginning and the final area of the game were fantastic, dripping with shocking emotional dilemmas, but the middle 80% of the game’s content seemed like it relied too much on oddball humor and not much else. The game hilariously plays with expectations and has no shortage of genuinely witty satire of its genre, and I found myself amused by nearly all of it, but after the first two hours as I was walking across long linear worlds and listening to dozens of characters try to tell me jokes, I started to wonder where the emotional gravity had gone. “Why is this game making me laugh, when I thought it was supposed to make me cry?” I asked myself. “Where are the feelings? After such an excellent and powerful prologue, why is the game taking so long to show me more?”

Later that night, as I was lying awake in bed, the answer hit me: the game was quirky and lighthearted because I was sparing everyone’s life. I wasn’t playing as a murderer. If you want this game to have drama, And I think that’s where all the hype is coming from, all the talk about player choice. This is a game about being a tree-hugging pacifist, or a murderous psychopath who kills anyone who gets in the way, or anything in between. You only need to live with whomever you decide to be, because the game won’t let you ignore what you have done.

Though it isn’t the most visually impressive game, and the stage design isn’t always the best, has left me feeling that I have just witnessed a work of art. It tried some new and ambitious things and isn’t ashamed of what it wanted to be. It's about 6 hours long; I’d recommend anyone to play it at least twice, just to be able to say that they've made their own choices and seen what the game has to offer. It’s hard to imagine that anyone would regret the experience."

Ten dollars. Only a few hours of gameplay. 16-bit graphics compared to the flashy 1080p stuff in standard games.

But... wow. Undertale blew me away. It doesn't need flashy graphics or even fanservice to falsify its enjoyment. It just does things right, and boy that was one immensely enjoyable experience.

I think most of the magic of this game comes from knowing absolutely nothing about it. I got this game from a friend and just decided to play it since it looked very interesting and it was getting good responses. So I went in completely blind, knowing nothing but the game's name. And I'm glad I did, because everything the game presented to me was unexpected, notably dark in places, and very emotional, which would have been lost entirely if i watched someone else play it. So, if you happened to have been flooded by everything Undertale on tumblr and the entire story's already laid out for you, the magic has been lost and the game won't be as incredible of an experience. I'm sorry.

Of course, I call Undertale an ""experience"", not a game, only because it does such a fantastic job at it. Following the motto on the store page, ""the game where you don't have to destroy anyone"", the game always tries to nudge you in that direction, taking a back seat in your mind and reminding you to ""Spare them!"". And of course, you answer with ""Why? Why should I do that when it offers me the option to kill anyone I want right in front of me? What's in it for me?"" And that's where the game literally turns into a personal experience, as everyone has a different response for the game's selling point. And boy, does it turn to black or white pretty fast from here.

Undertale's ability to completely turn the tables of its story depending on your actions is massive. Upon your game's startup, every little thing you do will be set in stone in the game's story pathing. If you're the type who immerses yourself into the game's charming music, laughs at the childish but hiliarious anctics, and is willing to hork down healing items just to prevent yourself from killing a monster just because a fight is difficult, the game rewards you. It opens up a very character-developing and world-unfolding story, along with some of the most emotionally invested boss battles I have ever experienced. You know a game is good when it breaks the fourth wall so well that you're shaking in your seat in true fear and can't stop the shivers, all while having to fight a hopelessly overpowered god of a boss. The amazing writing only starts once you beat the final few bosses, and the story doesn't stop being good from there onwards.

On the other hand, what makes this game different is that it keeps its dark side from you, and its entirely your choice to experience it. If you scoff at the game's sparing choice since you're or to possibly be nice to people, you can go around and intentionally sink your weapon into a monster who just wants to be a friend. And unlike many other games, this isn't just a simple moment of ""Oops, I killed another unnamed enemy, let's reset the game and nothing changes""... the weight of a dark choice is huge. Nothing can be taken back, and it forever changes your playthrough. Reset the game, and the characters know. Events change. And with each curious kill, you, in turn, turn from the only human in a land of monsters into the biggest monster in a land of innocents. In the end, ignoring what Undertale sets out to do, which is to let you experience childlike innocence and fun, only makes it delibrately change the game into a quieter, more grim story. Very little character development, and the world isn't explained to you, nothing. There's very little reward for going through this route. Yet it is a choice you can do. Granted, you get two of the hardest boss battles by becoming the murderer and will be forced into Game Overs repeatedly from them, but even that is a message from the game...

It's as if you're doing deeds in an actual living, breathing world. And that's what makes it even more terrifying when you decide to become a murderer instead of a savior, because only you know that you're willingly going forward to obliterate every weakling in front of you. It's a test of your willpower, and it's your choice. The worst thing? The damage cannot be repaired. Go clean, or go home tainted. The game even gives you the choice to completely delete everyone's happiness after the most satisfying happy ending. The happiness you worked so hard to earn. And you can even become the murderer after saving the world, which will only permanently taint your game and never let you have a satisfying ending again. That's absolutely brutal, and yet that's still a choice. Amazing.

Yes, this game might not be for everyone. The humour may become dry after a while for some people, and tons of gamers nowadays like to bash at popular games instead of trying it out, just because they feel accomplished by doing it. But, if like me, you are willing to experience why everyone's been talking about this game, give it a shot. Hell, even if you hate the game to bits and want to kill everyone, buy the game, do so, and at least have your own personal experience before refunding it. This game does the morality concept so well that other games can only dream of doing the same, and it is one not to be forgotten.

It is a sin to call Undertale a game. Doing that would categorize Undertale into the bland and consequence-free ""kill-em-all"" genres that a lot of games are falling into now.

Undertale is a story-driven, emotional ."

At a first glance, Undertale probably looks like any other bland/low budget RPG but looks can be deceiving. Underneath the pixelated exterior lies a gem that I would consider to be the crown jewel of indie games: a highly successful kickstarter that was conceptualized and developed (mostly) by one person (Toby Fox).
To this day, I still reminisce about my multiple playthroughs and still regularly listen to the soundtrack (and covers). Simply thinking about the game fills me with determination.

Played with keyboard

Positive:
Lately I have been hesitant to describe a game as “unique”. Given how saturated the gaming market is, truly unique games have become harder to come by. In fact, it is often easier to just resell nostalgia. Think of endlessly milked game-series (i.e. FIFA) and the large influx of remasters/remakes. Furthermore, “unique” can sometimes be a “non-word”; a lazy descriptor that doesn’t actually say much about a game.
. I am not exaggerating when I say that I have never played anything quite like it. I would go as far to say that this game has shifted the paradigm for future 2D turn-based RPGs. Having played so many RPGs before, I mindlessly jumped into Undertale with the usual RPG mentally; kill bad monster, level up good. Without giving away too much, I will simply say that this game made me question my subconscious bias and left me determined to replay multiple times.
In the hopes that this game will have a similarly profound impact on you (whoever is reading this), I intentionally wrote this review to be as vague and with as few spoilers as possible.






A modern classic and personal favorite. Highly recommended to all (including my future children)."

I hated Undertale.

It was, pretty clearly, a game about sexy skeletons. I did not care about sexy skeletons. I refused to play a game about sexy skeletons.

Then my friend made me listen to the soundtrack, and I decided I could deal with a few hours of sexy skeletons if I got to listen to the best video game music I had ever heard while doing it.

I played Undertale. It's not a game about sexy skeletons. It's a game about choices, maybe, or morality, or curiosity. It's a game about pushing the limits. It's a game about experiences, about ""what would happen if I did this?"", about storytelling so intricate and complex and raw that it shouldn't be able to fit into seven hours of bullet hell and pixel graphics. But, somehow, it does. Every choice you make has an impact. Every object you check has a story. The soundtrack, the witty yet profound writing, the simple pixel graphics, and even the menu screens and bullet patterns themselves all intertwine in order to tell a story that only you decide the ending of.

Also, the skeletons aren't even sexy.

My advice to you: Go in as blind as you can. Don't read walkthroughs. Don't watch playthroughs. Don't prepare yourself. Don't even look at overviews. Hell, don't even read the Steam page description. Just buy the game (and give some well-earned money to a little white dog), and, as it were, climb the mountain yourself. Don't let anyone backseat. Don't listen to people who tell you there's a right way to play.

And when you think you've reached the end, just think--what other choices could you have made?

So, yes. I hated Undertale.

And then I played it."

This is one of those few games that come along when times are bleak, and games have become regularly bland and heartless. Where you feel disenfranchised with the whole idea of video games. And you begin to start ask ""Why?""... Like ""Why should we play games?"", ""Why are games different from other media?"", ""Why should you use games as a form of expression?"" and even ""Why even play games at all?!""

Undertale come along and says, ""This is why."""

When I first heard of Undertale, I had no interest in playing it. I thought the fanbase was massively cringeworthy and the game was probably uninteresting.
I was correct about the fanbase, but boy was I wrong about the game.

I normally play action/adventure RPG games with the occasional sprinkling of singleplayer FPS. I am not the kind of person to normally go in for conceptual hipster nonsense, and I say that because that's what I thought this game was.

In reality, it has some of the best atmosphere and writing I've seen in a game in a very long time. And above all else, it manages to be heart-rendingly (no pun indended) sad at times and actually funny at other times. Plus, the music is fantastic and the whole package has a level of care I don't often see anymore.

You are doing yourself a disservice if you don't try this game out. And I don't say that lightly.

Story/writing: 10
Music: 8
Replay value: 7
Gameplay: 6 for the actual fun of it, but I'll give it a 7 just because of how inventive the mercy system is. This is an RPG you can play without killing anything."

When this little game rolled onto the Steam storefront on September 15th of 2015, I think it’s pretty safe to say hardly anyone probably could’ve imagined the impact it would have. I know I certainly didn’t; after all, my first exposure to Undertale came in the form of seeing the backlash its own fanbase brought upon it, alongside the vocal cynics and critics who panned it as “overrated garbage”. With claims flying left and right that it was the next Five Nights At Freddy’s and constant jokes about how it was “Tumblr’s favorite game”, I had plenty of reason to be skeptical.

When I looked into things myself, though, I found something far different than what I had been anticipating. Even from the very first moments I saw it in action, Undertale…connected with me, in a way few games have ever managed to, first impression or otherwise. As time continued on, I was shocked to see just how much love the game was receiving, including praise from such people as Totalbiscuit and Yahtzee (people known to have trouble enjoying most JRPGs), and so it rapidly became clear that there had to be something to this game; something big. If it could so thoroughly draw in even those who typically can’t enjoy the genre, then if nothing else, it had to be worth checking out.

I went in with some damn high expectations.
What I got was one of the best games I’ve ever played.

I truly wish I had the words to properly explain what Undertale is to me. I could go on for hours about the near-perfection of the soundtrack. I could rave about the writing and how rewardingly rich in detail and nuance it is. I could praise it for its characters and the level of care put into making even the most minor NPCs come to life with personality. I could write a freakin dissertation on the sheer brilliance of how it uses meta not only to comment on the tropes and conventions of its genre, but also as a powerful gameplay and storytelling tool that rewards replay value. I could gush until the end of time about the powerful messages Undertale presents and the skill with which it presents them, even addressing real world issues with an inspiring amount of dignity.

However, what I truly adore the most about this game is how unapologetic it is. It’s never afraid to be what it is, and that confidence takes its strengths and makes them into something far greater than the sum of those parts. From start to finish, Undertale is one of the most utterly brilliant games I’ve ever seen, executed with a pitch-perfect prowess that creates an experience the likes of which few other games can match.

There is always something new; another layer to be peeled back; another beautiful detail to be discovered. And the deeper one digs, the more brilliantly this absolute diamond of a gem sparkles. No part of Undertale is manufactured: not a single pixel has escaped the loving caress of a gentle crafting hand, and as the offspring of a mere $51,000 Kickstart (over 10x the amount Toby asked for), it’s easily one of the most refreshing games of the last few years. Undertale made me laugh. Undertale made me cry. Undertale made me think deeply about the world around me.

But most powerfully of all, Undertale touched me unlike any game before it. It's no small wonder, then, that upon completion it became my favorite game that I've ever played.

Yes indeed, this wonderfully unforgettable experience.

It fills me.
With determination.

I adore this game.

Undertale is a game that has gained a considerable reputation, and even if you haven't played it, you've likely heard of it to some extent. While graphics and size are not the sole determinants of a game's quality, at first glance, it's hard to imagine how Undertale garnered so much praise with its seemingly simplistic graphics and ""simple"" gameplay. In reality, Undertale absolutely deserves all the praise it has received, and even now, many elements and its music continue to exude vitality in various other domains.

The game incorporates elements from traditional RPGs and Manic shooters in its gameplay, but what makes Undertale truly outstanding is not its gameplay but rather its storytelling and music. In terms of the story, Undertale presents players with a genuinely moving yet unconventional narrative about family, friendship, trust, and betrayal, employing a natural and unpretentious narrative approach. The game's interactivity is also remarkably high, allowing players to deeply experience the impact of their actions within the game and explore countless details to fully appreciate the game's charm. The characterization of the main characters in the game is vivid and lively, effectively showcasing their glamour. As for the music, Undertale's original and captivating soundtrack, combined with the game's storyline, provides players with a profound dual impact on their emotions and auditory senses.

No matter how exceptional a masterpiece may be, it is not exempt from criticism. However, in my view, this is not a game's flaw. Since the game's primary focus is almost entirely on crafting its narrative content, if you're not interested in most games' stories or cannot derive any emotional resonance from them, Undertale may not be suitable for you. Similarly, the game's systems are relatively intricate and complex, encompassing numerous puzzle-solving elements. Additionally, it deviates significantly from most typical RPG games, making the game much more challenging without guidance, and experiencing all the game's content in its entirety may require many meticulous operations. Furthermore, any spoilers regarding the game's plot can significantly undermine the gaming experience, putting players in a dilemma between relaxing walkthroughs and preserving the integrity of the experience. Certain routes in the game also pose considerable difficulty, rivaling that of hardcore Manic shooters, which may hinder all kinds of players from smoothly experiencing all of the game's content.

Undertale is an absolute must-play, worth experiencing for the majority of players. Please be careful not to get in touch with any game spoiler content, as it will greatly diminish the impact of the gaming experience. While it may require more time, it is undoubtedly worth it. If you don't enjoy narrative-driven games, dislike spending time exploring the game's content on your own, and don't enjoy empathizing with the game's characters, then Undertale may not be suitable for you."

(Mostly spoiler-free review)
I hate turn-based RPGs. This is my Game of the Year. What.

After becoming ULTRA-JADED about gaming with the cancellation of Silent Hills, this game re-established that games can be really, really frickin good.

This thing was made with an incredible amount of love, and it shows in every nook and cranny, every joke, every secret conversation you never thought a game dev would have thought to include. Tobyfox is the most thorough dev ever. I'm continuously impressed with how many things he thought to include in this game, and how he managed to make it all extremely fun the entire way through. You'd think you've seen everything in this game, but you haven't. There's always another amazing thing, another way to turn the genre on its head, another great joke you didn't see coming. And it stays engaging the entire time, supported by a cast of fantastic, endearing, hilarious characters. Great puzzles too, imo!

It avoids all the things about (turn-based and non) RPGs that I despise:
-There's no grinding (unless you want to)
-Battles are a great length and never overstayed their welcome for me
-There's no boring menu-navigation-only-based combat (bullet dodging/timing-based stuff really spices it up, as well as bossfights always having a new, really fun gameplay twist on them!)
-There's no unlikable/unrelatable characters that go on and on about you being the ""Chosen One"" or whatever
-No plot where you gotta go to the 7 temples and find the 7 sacred whatevers and then oh wait now that you've gotten those 7 sacred whatevers, you gotta go to 4 extra places and get 4 SUPER sacred whatevers...
-No backtracking (unless you want to! Backtracking is actually usually rewarded with more fun conversations and such.)
-No constant equipping and unequipping items because, oh, this one is +2 Def but -3 Speed but THIS one is +3 Speed and -2 Def but THIS one is immune to fire and this one is...
-It actually has a way more complex, useful moral than ""Evil is Bad, Good is Good."" Everyone has relateable motivations.
-The writing doesn't suck like 90% of RPGs. It has a wonderful sense of humor and a simple plot that is underlaid with complex emotions.
-Has jokes about anime, doesn't take itself seriously.

I could gush about it forever. Undertale's not only made me less jaded about gaming, but also less jaded about real life. It has a strong message about empathy that stays everpresent, while somehow not being cloying about it, or shoving the message down your throat. It's simply a wonderful experience, please play this thing!!"

a lot of negative reviews claim this game's community is ""awful"", ""cancerous"" and ""perverted"".

they might be right

however, it looks like those people did not get the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ memo that this place is for reviewing the game, and not the fanbase. why is fanbase even important in the first place? you can simply ignore it, if worst comes to worst.

so what about the game?

really, there are only two issues i have with undertale. once you begin the game, the first couple hours are absolutely boring as all hell. i have a feeling this might just be me though, because no one else seems to have similar gripes.

the second, more pertinent issue, is that the game lacks length. if you can read, you can see that i've played undertale for about 30 hours, and that's about as long as it's probably going to last you if you progress at a decent pace. keep in mind that i've very literally done everything there is to do and seen everything there is to see in these 30 hours.

now that that's out of the way, please consider the following:

the game has a really good story. i'm not gonna lie, one of the game's 3 endings almost made me cry. i'm not an emotional person either. i've played through games with truly gripping, touching stories like spec ops: the line and felt next to nothing, but undertale absolutely knocks the competition out of the park.

when i saw the credits roll for the last time, and knew that my time with undertale was done, i got the same feeling i've only felt before after finishing a very good book. i was sad because it was done, and sad because it would be a long time before anything would ever come close to the experience i'd had.

ok, well now you know how undertale affected me. let me explain why this happened.

1. undertale has wonderful music: toby fox, the game's maker, is actually not a writer nor programmer, but a ""music producer"". this complements perfectly the excellent battle system, which i'm about to discuss

2. battles. some of the game's battles, especially battles where you really are the bad guy (if you play the game you'll se what i mean), are exceptional. the epic momentum of toby fox's well written score works perfectly with the fun and fluid combat.

3. writing. toby fox seems to have a rare talent for excellent dramatic/comedic timing. if you play the game, as you should, you will see exactly what i mean. furthermore, the characters and story are just really fleshed out. in fact, i'm astounded to see someone from a music background succeed with flying colours where professional writers have failed many times over.


i highly encourage you to try this game"

At first glance, Undertale seems like any other 8-bit point-and-click adventure game with RPG elements. But upon playing it, I found out that there was far more to it than first meets the eye.

Undertale is a game with an amazing story, and a great cast of characters. At first, your very presence in the game seems to be shrouded by mystery as you ask questions like ""Who am I?"" and ""How did I get here?"" As time goes on, and you continue the story, you'll slowly discover more and more how everything ties together and falls into place.

Along the way, you meet some really awesome critters with great personalities. And based on your choices of how to interact with them, you can get some pretty wild outcomes!

Additionally, there are some cool little secrets, easter eggs, and mind games hidden along the way, with the ever so annoying tease that will really just make you throw up your hands and say ""What the actual stink was that?!?!""

While there are several variations, there are three main outcomes, each of which require a certain playstyle throughout your playthrough of the game. Neutral, Pacifist, and Genocide. Each of these requires you to do a certain number of tasks in a certain order, and if you wish to learn how to do this correctly, I suggest you look up some guides here on Steam. Though, just be warned, spoilers may be present, and the game is very story based.

Also, the game tends to break the 4th wall, and does it well. It reminded me a little of my time playing Doki Doki Literature Club in this way, though (in my opinion) Undertale does it better.

While most puzzles/minigames in this game are pretty straightforward and not too difficult, there are two boss battles in this game that are HARD. I'm talking hours of practive, learn the patterns hard. But dang, are they rewarding to get through.

Things I really loved about the game are as follows:

-Great characters
-Amazing story
-Bonus content w/ lore tied in that requires multiple playthroughs
-Fun mini-game concept
-Challenging bosses
-Old school themed 8-bit graphics
-Easter eggs
-A great sense of humor (including breaking the 4th wall)
-An innovative take on a timeless genre

A couple of things I thought maybe could of used a little improvement:

-All the gameplay is based on the minigames in which you interact with monsters. While there is some variety to this, it can become a little repetitive.
-This game is perfectly built for a Battle Royale mode, but there is none present (totally joking)

If you like games that are richly story based, innovate on timeless concepts, and provide a fun little adventure over the course of a few hours, then I heartily recommend Undertale!

Before I get into the game, I'll start off by saying that my friends played it almost as soon as it came out. One of them maybe even helped Kickstart it, I don't know for sure. I thought they were cringy as hell. They bought it for me, but I refused to play it for like a year and a half or something like that. I thought it was gonna be so overrated and that it was going to bore me to sleep. Hell, I really only played it because I wanted some of the trading cards that would come with it so I could get CS:GO cases. I honestly thought I'd just play it and be done.

But,

I have never been more wrong in my entire life

This game literally changed my outlook on life in general. The story is amazing, so long as you keep an open mind. The soundtrack was phenomenal. The songs perfectly portrayed what was going on in the story, especially when big story events happened. My only recommendation for playing this game would be to spare every monster before you try any of the other ways to play. If you're anything like me, it will change you. Over all, Undertale has become one of my favorite story-driven games ever. I haven't felt this attached to a fictional story in years. Undertale's fanbase is cringy. Hell, you probably think I'm cringy just by reading this. However, if you are in any way curious about this game, just try it. Go into it keeping an open mind and maybe you'll love it as much as I did.

tl;dr I thought this game was gonna be trash, but it was actually really good and I loved it."

I finally understand why this game made people go nuts in 2015"
undertale,Recommended,10.2,"Posted: November 13, 2015
Wow.

Just, wow.

I'm at a loss of words. This game...

...It's an absolute MASTERPIECE.

For my loyal readers, do you remember my Shovel Knight craze last year?

Undertale is my Shovel Knight of 2015.


Graphics

The graphics are a simple 8-bit style, and although it's considered ""generic"" because of the whole ""8 bit indie game made by one guy"" sort of thing, this game uses it properly. I know, that seems really weird, but it's true. If you play the game and take a certain route, the final boss WILL blow your mind with the visuals. Not much here to say, it's not what's supposed to make this game so noteworthy, but it's still acceptable nonetheless.

Gameplay

Undertale is a lot like Earthbound in many ways, the most notable trait being the turn based combat and how it's portrayed. Nowadays, LOTS of games have opportunities where you can spare or kill a certain character and decide their fate. Their flaw, however, is that the said death often is just shrugged off, both in the game's world AND in real life. Undertale takes this concept and cranks it up a notch, leaving literally every single character's fate in your hands. You can go for a pacifist run and kill no one, and this is the one I would recommend going for if you do decide to purchase this masterpiece. There's also the neutral ending, which is the most common of the bunch but has one of the most creative final bosses I've ever seen in video games. I won't spoil much, but it will BLOW your mind, you can trust me on that. There's also the genocide run, which is incredibly difficult to pull off because of how emotionally difficult it is to actually kill this lovable cast of monsters. The combat itself is like Earthbound's, as said earlier. This being said, Undertale takes yet another step forward, adding bullet hell and platforming to the mix and blends the two perfectly, making the game far more exciting, while keeping the original RPG elements.


This is the very core of why Undertale is such an unforgettable experience. Of course, though, you shouldn't be shocked at this point, because most of the internet will agree with me on that. The cast of characters is so diverse and unique, each one having traits to make them likable or the one you'd love to kill on a genocide run. For example, you have Sans, my favorite of the bunch. He's a laid back, prankster, and easy going skeleton who has a brother named Papyrus. What Papyrus lacks in intelligence, he makes up for with a big heart for humans. You also have Flowey, who immediately will creep you out because of how ruthless he is. As for the plot itself, it's one big emotional rollercoaster you would want to ride over and over and over again. It has its hilarious moments, since the writing is surprisingly well done, while it has its sad moments, too. What takes the cake on all of this, though, is that it literally makes you rethink everything you knew about video games. The fourth wall is also broken often, and this is done in the most clever and creative ways. It's like Kid Icarus: Uprising, except Undertale does it far better. I almost forgot, too, but every action in this game will be remembered by the characters, long after you actually beat it. People have called this game a ""sentient being"" and I can actually agree with them on that. Trust me, Undertale is literally perfect for storytelling, and I won't be shocked if you cried a bit. It's hard not to, and with such a unique cast of lovable characters, it further justifies my point.


I have a friend who also loves Undertale, and the one thing he seems to point out about it is the soundtrack. I can't blame him, because it's really catchy. Remember how I said this game was my Shovel Knight of 2015? I wasn't kidding about that, it has the awesome soundtrack to go with it. You have Bonetrousle, the sinister, yet lighthearted and catchy tune that fits Papyrus. There's the Spider Dance, Muffet's theme. This theme is a lot more evil but far more catchy, and is one of my personal favorites. The king of the bunch, however, is one that didn't directly originate from Undertale: Megalovania. Sans' theme is slowly becoming an iconic boss theme, as it has been used in two different times in the past, and this variation is definitely my favorite of the three. You also have some humorous songs, namely the Dogsong. I won't get too in-depth with that one, but I need to say this now: GEEEET DUNKED ON! There is no voice acting, but why does that even matter? This game doesn't need it. Overall, this game has some high quality music, and I love it that way.


As I said earlier, this game has multiple endings. Want to know what makes it interesting, though? The characters will remember EVERYTHING you've done. I mean that, too. Mess with the game's files and try to beat it that way, I dare you. With the multiple endings, the replayability is far more dependent on you. If you have no soul, you'll probably try and do a genocide run while doing the other two runs as well. Maybe you'll try and do a pacifist one so you don't have to go through the pain of killing anyone, then do a neutral, and finish with a genocide ending. Just remember, EVERY choice will be remembered permanently.


Undertale is easily my GotY at this point in time, but it's also one of the most creative games I've ever seen. This is an absolute masterpiece, and I really hope it wins a LOT of awards. Do I recommend this game? Well, I'll join the internet on this one and say, ""Of course!"" Just be ready to stock up on spaghetti, because you'll need it while you stress-eat and do a playthrough of this gem.

I remember how I avoided this game like the plague, the fandom and those cringe compilations really did a huge number to make me dislike the game even tho I never played it, in addition YouTube and all social media platforms were full with Undertale content, youtube was recommending playthroughs and boss fight videos basicaly spoiling the entire game for me. Now years later, when I noticed that I completely forgot everything about this game I finally decided it was the perfect time to play it, and boy oh boy was that the best idea I ever had.

Where do I even start, Undertale is an incredible game, it made me care about fictional characters like no other game has ever done. The story is fascinating, the world building is well done, the characters are unique and well defined and have genuinely made me laugh multiple times throughout my playthrough, and to this game’s credit the art style fits a minimalistic style that I love and appreciate and gets elevated by the wonderful work of art that is its soundtrack.

This game aged like a fine wine, it's enjoyable and entertaining and has done something that a few games can do, it made me care. I played it by following the advice my friend Bigby gave to me, which was “To fully enjoy the game, do not kill the monsters and bosses” and he is 100% correct, I enjoyed it more than I thought I would.

Consider myself a fan now Toby, looking forward to Deltarune."

♥♥♥♥. This is a tough one to write, not at all like my usual reviews. I'm just sort of rambling and gushing because there's so much to say about Undertale... and I can't SAY anything without spoiling the experience for you!

Yes, you!

Buy this game, don't watch anything on YouTube about it, don't read the Undertale subreddit or any wikis, don't even read this review (though I've avoided spoilers, of course) – just seal yourself into a room with a computer and some kind of makeshift toilet, play it to completion, clean yourself for the love of God, and come back.

...

Hero? Villain? Or something wholly other?

The year isn't out and there are some huge releases yet to come, but that being said...

Undertale is a GOTY contender, indie or otherwise.

It's the best RPG in a year of amazing RPG releases.

It's the funniest, most well-written game in, well, a very long time.

It's the most genuinely heartwarming (and incredibly dark) game in, well, a very long time.

It's challenging but surmountable, given a little skill and a whole lot of determination.

And it's also the most mind-♥♥♥♥♥ game in, well, a very long time, in an entirely unique way! Sure, you can compare it to Metal Gear's Psycho Mantis or Eternal Darkness' sanity meter effects, though that won't do Undertale's special, thoughtful mechanics justice.

But I digress.

You play as a tiny, gender-neutral child with bad fashion sense who falls down a mountain into a cavernous underworld filled with all sorts of fantastical monsters – all of whom have been banished there after losing a war with humankind. Now you have to get yourself back to the sunny, human-friendly overworld.

Fairly standard so far, complete with the pretty concept art cutscenes and humdrum hero origin tale.

Then five minutes pass and all your expectations just sort of fly out the proverbial window screaming, never to return.

Like, ever.

Thus begins your six, seven, or eight hour (initial) journey into Undertale. You'll encounter all sorts of wacky, zany characters and monsters, puzzles, traditional RPG-type environments... loaded with obstacles standing between you and the finish line. And it's up to you decide how you're going to approach the aforementioned zany characters and monsters. Sure, you can do the traditional “kill indiscriminately” thing, but that's just one solution. See, Undertale is an RPG where you can beat the whole damn thing without killing anyone!

Like, you can hug your way through the entire affair!

Easy enough, right?

And you can always just reload a save if you screw up, right?

…

Anyhoo, combat mechanics are... it's hard to describe. It's like a traditional turn-based RPG combat system only, well, those expectations all went screaming out that window I mentioned earlier. Your heart appears in a window below the enemy you're currently dealing with and you have to dodge bullet-hell-style attacks... most of the time anyway. Even after your old expectations are but a distant memory, newly established expectations go flying out screaming too.

It's a little weird.

If fighting is your style you'll have that option, of course. Presented with a flashing bar, hit the sweet spot and you'll do the most possible damage; rinse and repeat. You can access items, check on the enemy's stats and what have you, pursue a peaceful resolution... lots of options, and every monster is a little different.

Well, not a little different – incredibly different, incredible variety! And figuring out their ticks, traits, fears, and dreams is all part of the fun puzzle that is Undertale.

But there's more!

Undertale's music is fabulous – in that wonderfully synthetic, retro way. Every character has a “voice,” every monster, region, and special event has a theme, and when appropriate, the music is chillingly absent. It's the best part of this game - beside the top-notch writing.

I said every character has a “voice,” referring to the musical tones playing during dialogue. But they also each have their own VOICE, you understand? There's the overly protective mother, the bad jokester, the lacking-any-self-awareness fella... but even then it's just scratching the surface. These ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ emote! These sprites have some Shakespearean depth that becomes more apparent with each hour, each playthrough.

You'll care for them, whether you want to or not.

…


What else is there to say? I laughed out loud two dozen times or so, I lost count; I nearly cried at least five times, I was ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ jumpscared more than once, I had an existential crisis, and I'd do it all over again.

And again.

And again.

There's, like, nothing I can even complain about! Were some of the fights tedious, long-winded? Yeah, but I might be biased because I wanted to just enjoy more dialogue, more strange interactions, more environments. Were some of the references lost on me (particularly Anime stuff)? Sure, but that's what Google is for.

Undertale just is... objectively good.

Objectively great.

It's an experience like Shadow of the Colossus, Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Half-Life, Red Dead Redemption, Dark Souls, EarthBound... a little, unassuming 2D RPG game released in 2015 stands shoulder to shoulder with some of the best games of all time – one I initially judged by its cover and ignored.

I'm glad I deleted that particular corrupted save file and started fresh, because missing out on this game would have left a little heart-shaped void that I might have never filled."

-Amazing soundtracks

-Crippling paranoia about everything you've done and will potentially do in your miserable span of existence

I first played Undertale 6 and a half years ago. I was 11 years old and I went into it mostly blind. It was the first single player story based game I had ever played. My games library prior to Undertale was pretty much just Minecraft and Castle Crashers. My 11 year old mind was absolutely blown away by this amazing game. I remember laughing at the silly comedy, falling in love with the characters, and I remember very clearly being TERRIFIED when Flowey coldly called me out for killing Toriel and resetting to save her life. I quickly fell head first into the fandom. For a few years this game was EVERYTHING to me.

Around the time Deltarune Ch1 came out, (ironically) my interest had waned. Then two years after that, Covid hit and I went right back around to it. It was comforting and familiar and it was my lifeline during the pandemic.

All this to say... Undertale is very important to me. I recently replayed the game after receiving it as a gift, and I was able to rediscover everything that made this game be hot glued to my soul. Something that has been lost in the fandom, between the theorizing and the multiplying AUs and the memes is the HEART that went into this game. This game is full of so much heart. It's about love and choosing kindness despite everything, about granting mercy whenever possible, and friendship, and love, love, love. Oh the things we do for love. The love of the sibling you'd do anything for. The love of the children who have gone. The love of the kingdom drowning in sorrow.

Toby Fox masterfully weaves a story of tragedy and hope. A story where people are selfish and cowardly and heartbroken, where people make mistakes again and again, and despite all that they deserve a second chance, and a third, and a fourth, and as many chances as it takes to do the right thing. He presents us with these flawed characters and shows us how to love them not despite but because of those flaws. Despite the simplistic graphics, he somehow blurs the line between real life and video game to such a degree that I can never bring myself to reset after achieving the happiest ending. These little clumps of pixels have wormed their way into my heart and are there to stay permanently.

I could wax poetic for days about the other things that make this game great. Toby's attention to detail to such a minute degree that I'm still finding out new things 7 years after the game's release. The secrets hidden in the code. The foreshadowing and mysteries that plague the fandom to this day. The million little dialogue differences based on your actions, and the numerous endings to the game. But I think I've said it all. This game is not the best game I've ever played, not by a long shot. But due to the way the story has impacted me, it is my favourite. I hope I can make something that impacts someone even a fraction of how this game has impacted me.

Good night."

EDIT: I've truncated this review to try and avoid any implied spoilers. Besides, most of the stuff I cut was fluff.

I was skeptical when I bought it. Oh boy, another game with a moral choice system. I was wrong. So terribly wrong.

This is the only game I've ever played that made me fall out of my chair laughing, jump out of my chair in shock, and slump out of my chair in the least manly of tears. I need a new chair is what I'm saying. The other thing I'm saying is... just... holy crap. This game is powerful.

It's also nice to have a game where I can have a cute flower as a best friend who understands everything I've done.

Go in blind. Play it how you like - there is no ""correct way"" to play it, and the game makes no presumptions. Just remember this -- you are NOT above consequences.

And if you don't like it, that's okay too. Not every game is for everyone. This one definitely was for me."

I love this game so much, I made the trailer for it! I did so after being super impressed by the demo, and asking Toby if there was some way I could help out.

After experiencing the final game, my high expectations were absolutely blown away.

Undertale is a fantastic, novel, unforgettable RPG experience in so many ways.


It couples thoughtful, reactive NPC interactions with a very engaging bullet hell / varied minigame combat system that, unlike most rpgs, never becomes a bore or a slog. Difficulty was a gentle ramp, though affords opportunties for the player to really challenge themselves. All of the combat defenses are unique to each enemy, serving as both funny and clever expressions of their personalities. Mechanically the combat is so solid it makes me wonder why I haven't seen it done before.

Undertale ties its combat and the rest of its game systems so intricately into its narrative, into achieving what it sets out to do as an experience, that it's almost magical.

The characters are genuinely likable and relatable. I find this supremely important to stay interested in narrative-focused games and Undertale does not disappoint. Depending on your interactions with characters, the choices you make will hit you. Hard.

Audio... Well, Toby Fox is known for doing some tremendous music tracks. On first listen to many of Undertale's songs I said to myself 'oh yeah, I can tell this is going to become an instant classic.' The melodies and compositions are just excellent, and truly help create memorable in-game experiences. You want the soundtrack, trust me.

I might consider graphics to be the 'weakest' aspect of Undertale, but I'd stress that they are utterly appropriate and support the experience. Really the one nitpick I have is that I'd liked to have seen more NPC animations in the overworld, to make monsters feel as lively and ~sassy~ as they do in combat. But it's a small quibble in a very, very intricate game. Ultimately Undertale's simple, cartoony, certainly Mother-esque graphic style suits it perfectly, enhancing and fortifying a very chill, friendly tone.

A single playthrough is in the neighborhood of six hours, but by design Undertale encourages both replay and reeximation of choices made throughout the game. I went through its content repeatedly, eagerly looking for new insights and interactions I had missed, and I feel like I got way more value than I could ever hope to expect for the price.

Get this game, it's touching. It's worthwhile. It's Undertale.


Oh, and Toby? Thanks for letting me help you. It means a lot to me."

Undertale, “the friendly RPG where no one has to die.” When a game makes you feel bad for killing monsters and makes you consider not killing any more, then it definitely does something right!

Story

The story goes that both monsters and human once ruled over earth, living together, until war broke out between the two races. The humans defeated the monsters and drove them to the depths of Mt. Ebott, trapped with a magic spell. You appear on a bed of golden flowers, and are greeted by a flower, and taught about friendliness pellets. Afterwards, you can choose to massacre every monster you meet, or choose to show mercy to your opponents. Your actions of killing or mercy will shape the way the game progresses, as well as how others view you. The dialogues, and even the music of the game will become happier or distorted based on your killings or acts of mercy. With that said, there are a few endings that can be achieved within the game, some being more satisfying than others; some feeling like you are cutting onions, and some just for the cold hearted. What makes these outcomes to impactful, and sometimes sad, is the way the monsters react to the player’s actions, and sometimes questioning your actions and making you feel like a monster for the things you do. This is also true when you do immoral things like take more than one candy from a bowl of candy that says “take one please”.


Gameplay is very easy to catch on to, and is like one of those old time rpg games like Earthbound. Your goal is simple, but complex, just get through the game(through any means necessary). Your initial goal, or why you are there are not stated, but you can assume you fell down the mountain (as seen in the opening). Your real goal is to play the game as you like, exploring this unique world of monsters and see what it has to offer. While you explore the world, you will have numerous random encounters with monsters, in which you are a heart that must avoid monster’s attacks, and will die if you take too much damage (causing you to restart at your last save). Pretty easy to understand and play, but a bit difficult to master, as some of the later encounters will be a lot more difficult to dodge seamlessly, and may prove to require a bit more thought and endurance to overcome, rather than just one lucky turn. The game itself is not too difficult, in that it does not have any difficult puzzles to do, and no grinding is required to win the game, as the game can be beaten without killing a single thing.


The visuals are all a bit old timey, but that does not take away from the experience. As for the audio, there are a wide variety of songs that make the game very fun while in combat scenarios. The beginning music was a bit new to me, as I did not think it would have the old retro type of music, but it surprisingly worked well and was not monotonous, and seemed to match the backdrops, and battles very well.


Why would I include a characters section in a review? The answer is, because they are such an integral part of the game, otherwise it would be like any other rpg, with the exception of the option to spare your opponents. The characters are what make this game so memorable. It’s not the fact these characters are super likeable, since you may end up disliking or even hating some of them, but the fact these characters will end up growing on you in the end. Without such a unique and hilarious cast of characters, the player would not feel any real motivation to spare them, or any remorse if the player decides to kill any of them. They are in all respects to this game, the driving force that makes it so popular and why it causes many (if not all) it’s players to shed tears.

9/10

Staying determined really is the only way to beat this game!

Some games are okay.

Some games make you stop and reevaluate who you are at the very core of your person, make you feel a depth of emotion that no work of art ever has before, and then leaves you with a genuine sense of loss when its all finally over and gone, because you know you won't ever be able to experience anything that beautiful for the first time ever again.

You should probably play Undertale and find out which one it is."

This game was (and still is) 𝘵𝘳𝘶𝘭𝘺 amazing. I don't play pixel games often, but this game proves worthy of the highest tier.
The storyline is very captivating, and you always have a desire to explore forwards. Characters are unique and lovable in their own ways, whether that's looks, personality, humour, or speech. Map design and environments are quite lovely. The story changes based on how you interact with people and battle opponents; your choices 𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘭𝘭𝘺 𝘥𝘰 matter, but you can also replay with a different playstyle to experience a new game. The ending(s) are especially brutal in the best way possible. You'll wish you could erase your memory and play it for the first time again.
Even if I had an hour to think, I could not create 𝘢𝘯𝘺 complaints for this game. I wish I could give it 2 thumbs up. You won't regret buying Undertale, simply put."

How do I explain this game? Its like trying to describe a sunset to the blind. There's no *real* way reading any review or explanation could give you the exact feeling playing this game gives you. But I'll try to give you an idea.

When I first saw the trailer and heard of it I skipped past it a bunch. Sure I heard it was a good game, but it was some wierd 16bit thing. I'd rather play GTAV right?

Boy was I wrong.

So it comes on sale and I grab it out of sheer curiosity. Man was I in for a treat. The game itself is mechanically simple. You avoid enemy attacks with your red heart as enemies shoot varying behaving projectiles at you and then fire back by either using the ""fight"" option or the ""act"" option.

Its how the game handles the aftermath that makes it special. Kill a monster? It remembers that. Regret it and reload the game? The game remembers that too. You grow attached to these underground dwelling monsters, from the silly innocent Papyrus to the brave Undyne. I'm going to avoid spoilers as to how these characters develop but suffice it to say that they are all unique, likeable, and everyone is going to have their favorite. No monster down here in the underground is easily classified under evil or good. They all have stories. They all have reasons for the way they are.

The graphics aren't anything special but they don't *need* to be. This is a game about a story. This is a game where you can write story. Do you want to be the angel that saves the monsters, or the demon that destroys them? Do you want to crown someone king? Or do you wish to make no friends and simply leave this underground place.

All that can be done. By your choices. By your actions.

Don't take my word for it. I know you've been skipping past this game awhile. Maybe you keep seeing it in your front page and go ""Ugh! I already know about this game!""

Do yourself a favor. Buy it. Its worth every dollar spent and you'll remember this game for the rest of your life."

Undertale. What to like about this game? Warning, Undertale is best played without ANY prior information. GO IN BLIND. Then you will understand what the game truly is.

-The Morality System: Your every action has consequenses. Unless you go into the game's files, the game could potentially remember you killing a single enemy and then reseting 100 times. The Game is not afraid to shatter the fourth wall, and when it does, it does so with glee.

-The Combat System: The game is a combination of traditional RPGs and Bullet-Hell shooters. You can dodge every attack if you are good enough. Also, with the ability to spare of kill any Monster you encounter, it challenges what we think of as good RPGs.

-The Story: While the story is basic at first, it is more about the characters you meet along the way. Flowey, the master of fourth wall breaking and a terrifying creature. Toriel, the motherly character who will do anything to protect you. Sans, a skeleton armed with bad puns and bad times. Papyrus, the brother of Sans who will do anything to join the Royal Guard and loves cooking spaghetti. Undyne, the leader of the Royal Guard with a hotheaded personality. Alphys, the Royal Scientist with a dark secret and a passion for Anime. Mettaton, the Killer Robot TV Host. Asgore, the king of all Monsters. Not to mention each Monster in a battle has a personality.

-The Endings: Neutral, Pacifist, and Genocide. The Three endings. I can't spoil to much, except that each ending accomplishes very different things. For Example, while Pacifist gives you a feeling of happiness, Genocide is physically and Mentally exhausting. In Genocide, you're gonna have a bad time.

-The Music: Oh My Days, the Music. Beautiful in every way.

Is this a good game? Yes. This surpassed all my expectations. 10/10."

Upon first discovering it, Undertale seemed like a neat little game, with its promises of ""you don't have to kill anyone"" and ""you can date a skeleton."" When I got around to playing it, though, I went in as a skeptic; sure, a lot of people on my Steam friends list were giving it high praise, but I had doubts that it could really be THAT good. After two playthroughs (one neutral and one 100% pacifist), I can safely say that it really is THAT good. This review will probably be a bit vague, but I don't want to spoil a single important moment of the game.

That being said, this is not a game that will hook you from minute one. The game as a whole is deeply inspired by--almost a love letter to--the Earthbound/Mother series, and the opening scenes reeked a bit of trying way too hard to emulate those excellent, beloved games. Undertale takes a little while to find its own voice, and it does eventually reach the point where its unique style and charm becomes fully realized.

In particular, the game masterfully shifts gears between hilarious and heartwrenching, and wacky and reverent, sometimes in the same scene! A few jokes fall flat, of course, but this game had me smiling and laughing way more than any other game in recent (or even not-so-recent) memory. The characters are delightful, and the gags can be both groanworthy and genuinely hilarious. The more serious, emotional scenes still don't feel out of place, though--the changes in tone never feel abrupt or out of place.

The story and characterization are incredible. Just trust me on this. The only thing I'll point out here is that I love how the main character was designed. This character is androgynous and never assigned a gendered pronoun, which I think is really nice!

The music is incredible, too.

Gameplay of Undertale feels secondary to the plot in terms of importance, but it's still just as fantastic as the rest of the game. It's a somewhat ecclectic mix of strategy (How can I end this battle peacefully?) and bullet hell-inspired dodging sequences done in WarioWare-sized chunks. Battle encounters against each of the game's enemies are all well-crafted; boss fights are fun challenges, with most offering their own unique spin on the basic game mechanics.

Calling Undertale ""a labor of love"" doesn't even do it justice in my mind. This project feels like something that was in developer Toby Fox's head for a long time, and he finally managed to get it out and present it to the world. You should play it. Yes, you. It's real good."

I had to see what all the hype was about. How could this little indie game have better reviews than The Witcher 3? Honestly, I was very skeptical going in.

I'm no stranger to old school games; I grew up playing NES and I'm on the verge of finishing Earthbound on 3DS. However, the truth is that I was super annoyed with the control/mechanics of Undertale for the first 5 hours I was playing. Everything just felt so archaic and aggravating! But I was *DETERMINED* to finish so that I could say I'd beat it when I wrote the negative review I was planning. So, I kept playing.

But then something happened... The game started breaking the 4th wall... The game began to blow my mind... My knuckles were white from how intense the bullet-hell battles were becoming... The charm and quirkiness that had annoyed me in the beginning was now the cause of the permanent grin plastered on my face as I played...

In the end, I must confess: The people are right. The hype is not empty. Undertale deserves all the love."
undertale,Recommended,13.1,"Posted: May 16, 2016
I think it's a testament to Undertale's excellence that, despite my exposure to the embarassing cosplays, horrible (and at times pandering) fanart, bizarre Rule 63 alternate universe shippings, and an obsessed community that only Tumblr and anonymous image boards could create, it still managed to blow me away and leave me suprised.

Every facet of Undertale is pouring at the seams with tender care; the memorable characters, the wacky encounters, it's unpredictable gameplay and the layered soundtrack that fits perfectly with every situation. Believe it or not, this game never feels like it was made to pander; instead, it feels like it exists as a labor of love, a tribute to what makes video games in general great. Because of this, it's very easy to distance what the game actually is from whatever the heck some parts of the fanbase want it to be.

It does truly upset me that many people are so disgusted by the rabid fanbase that they're turned off from playing Undertale, but this game has a massive following for a very good reason - I myself feel horrible I waited so long to experience it. It's that very rare kind of game that I think everyone should at least give a shot."

Undertale is both a game that can be so heartwarming, yet heartbreaking at the same time. Usually it depends on what route you choose to go down in your adventure, but both aspects can be found in any route. Undertale is a stunning game that i share many many lovable memories with. This game has been there through my ups and downs since it released, and I hold it very near and dear to my heart. Toby Fox is a genius, both story-telling wise and music wise. The characters and soundtrack tell such an incredible story and all the characters are very well thought out, in both their stories and personalities. Undertale will forever be a feel-good game that will always cause me to get emotional."

I don't normally ever write reviews for games, even ones that I like. However, Undertale is probably the best game, nay, best piece of any form of artistic medium I have ever experienced. When Undertale first came out, I automatically pushed it away because of the fan base. That was the worst mistake I could ever have made. This game changed who I am. This game helped make me who I am today. Before Undertale, I was a bitter, kind of hurtful person. I bought the game when I was a freshman in high school, and my friends made fun of me for it. They reduced the game to its then toxic fan base. I heard overwhelming good things about the game, and decided to give it a chance, ignoring its fan base. My best decision I have ever made in terms of a simple purchase was at this moment.

The game itself is a very humorous and wholesome game. The game legitimately made me realize I should treat others with respect and friendliness because of how warm inside the game made me feel. The soundtrack reflects the wholesome/humorous themes in this work of actual art. Tracks like ""Bonetrousal"" and ""Temmie Village"" are on the more humorous side of the soundtracks. And there are also the more serious, heart string-plucking songs such as ""Home,"" ""Undertale,"" and ""Save the World"". ""Undertale"" in particular really could be considered a piece of art in itself. Toby Fox is an absolute musical genius. Without the soundtrack, the game just wouldn't be the same. Undertale is the only video game I have ever become emotionally invested in, and I've been playing video games as long as I can remember.

I truly believe that this is the best game that has ever been made. There is so much passion and SOUL put into this small, 200 MB game. Toby Fox poured his heart into these characters and this soundtrack. If I could forget playing Undertale so I could play it for the first time again, I would do it in a heartbeat.

This game changed me, and I think It might change you too. Thank you Toby Fox for this wonderful game, you changed so many lives and lit up the world."

At first when I saw this game I didn't think much of it. All I knew about the game was that there were two cool looking skeletons named Sans and Papyrus. Other than that I thought nothing else of this game. Infact I thought this game was lame in all honesty. So, one day I decided to purchase the game. I thought it was going to be a waste of money. Little did I know this game was going to be the most heart wrenching, intense, emotional game I will ever play in my life. The characters in this game are memberable and relatable. Theres always excitment everywhere you turn. I've been so attached to the characters in this game. When they gave me the option to kill I could never bring myself to it. Even after beating this game I can't bring myself to hurting the characters. WHICH IS SO STRANGE BECAUSE THEY ARE VIDEO GAME CHARACTERS. This just goes to show that this game will make you attach yourself to the characters you interact with. And the underlying theme of this game is incredibly strong. I don't want to reveal it in this review you're just going to have to beat the game and find out for yourself. This game is incredibly powerful and it's totally worth the price. You will be entertained for hours and your heart will be torn into bits and pieces (trust me, my heart was crying so much) If you are still reading this I thank you for your time. Toby Fox and his team did an amazing job on this video game. I've never been happier with a game such as this one. Lastly, Don't judge a book by its cover, as cliche as this sounds, thats what I did and I could've missed out on a great game. That is all I have to say. Have an amazing day:)"

Please don't let your impression of the fanbase ruin this game for you. Undertale is an amazing experience and I'm so jealous of anyone experiencing this game for the first time. It features an amazing cast of memorable and diverse characters, a heartwarming and compelling storyline, unique gameplay, and an incredible soundtrack. Enjoy it, and try to not let anyone else take away from your experience of the game. Overall this is one of the reasons video games could be classified as an art. Have fun and stay determined."

I expected to be bored, but the clamouring of my teenage daughter to finally FINALLY play this thing grew incessantly hard to ignore. So I caved--and I'm glad I did. The charm and stunning soundtrack threw me back to my own teens, when I played and loved nerdy-but-cool JRPGs like Chrono Trigger (of which this reminded me, not least because of the catchy tunes). That said, this game felt thoroughly unique with its mixture of catchy writing, endearing charm, soulful humanity and sheer backasswardness. At times disheartened by the bullet-hellish challenges too frustrating for my old-man reflexes, I was nevertheless filled with DETERMINATION and managed to rediscover that home is where the heart is."

Undertale is difficult to explain. There's something about it that just shines so brightly, the dialogue is witty, the characters are so interesting and diverse, and the story is amazing. Undertale is one of those games that when you complete it, you want to forget that you played it and experience it again. Undertale is by far one of my favourite games and I hope that others can enjoy it the way I have."

A friend bought me this game a little while after it came out and let me tell you that it has become such a huge part of my life. The characters are all unique and full of whit and real emotion, you will quickly become attached to them as if they were truly your friends in real life. I can honestly say that I cry every time I play this game, I highly recommend it. Don't let the crazy fandom deter you from picking up a copy of this for your game library, it is entirely worth it.

Definitely a solid 10/10 for me."

Listen. You and I both know that if you're browsing reviews and haven't played Undertale yet, you've probably seen or heard things that summon a bad taste in your mouth just from hearing the name. I was fortunate enough to play the game very shortly after it was released, and it was one of my favorite gaming experiences since I first picked up a GameBoy 20 years ago. It's no easy task to isolate the game from all the negative stigmas surrounding it that have arisen over the years, and I feel bad for all the people who have been turned away because of such things, but if you try your best to push all that aside you'll find fun characters, quirky gameplay, and spectacular music that come together to tell an amazing story that I don't think anyone should miss."

I am 42.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ****ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.
After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

That's all, thank you

One of the most heartfelt and genuine games I've ever played. Undertale is an RPG where, as advertised, you don't have to kill anyone. You play as a child who has accidentally fallen into an underground society of monsters, long since locked away after an unsuccessful war on humanity.

However, despite an immediate declaration that this world is ""kill or be killed,"" you are introduced to a motherly monster named Toriel who introduces you to the Ruins you have landed in, and the puzzle-based world they live in. From there, you find your own way, and decide to befriend the monsters, or whether they are deserving of your wrath, as you venture forth and find a way home.

As overly 'quirky' as the screenshots of the game may make it seems (although don't get me wrong, the game is gut-bustingly funny), Undertale's writing is top-notch. No other game has invoked so much emotion in me, in... well, ever. The game runs the gambit from heart-wrenching tragedy, to unstoppable laughter, to genuine unease, aided in part by the way the game handles YOU, as a player, and the way you interact within the world, and what sort of entity you are compared to the denizens of the underground. And on top of that, each character is unique and has a strong personality, from the bosses-turned-friends (on pacifist runs) to each and every monster you encounter.

The music is, most certainly, one of the game's strengths. Most of the game was made by Toby Fox, a musician who has composed for the popular webcomic Homestuck. Each track is crucial in setting the game's tone, and most songs will stay with you, even long after you've left the world of Undertale.

I'm really bad and awkward at writing, so if there's one thing to take away from this review, it's this:

This game has exceeded all of my expectations and made me emotionally unstable. Get it."

Just buy it. Don't read anything, don't touch the fanbase, just go in blind and I'm sure you'll enjoy it. The characters in this game have so much... character and the game overall just has a beautiful atmosphere. Gripping from start to end.

Undertale reminds me of the time I was a kid when I could play a game with next to no preconceptions. I'd see it for the adventure that it was, the wild fantastical world that I loved to lose myself in. I didn't care about anything else, who made it, what it looked like, the genre it encompassed. Just the idea of what I thought I could find if I played it.

There are a lot of things that be can be said about the game, but I think the real thing is how the experience is so different for so many players. It seems to connect to people in a way they didn't expect it to. It is, at its core, a lovingly handcrafted experience. The best thing you could possibly do is to ignore everything else that has been said about Undertale and just play it for yourself."

The Best Game İn The World


Yes we know this so lets learn how to make a cupcake


Step 1: Prepare Ingredients
Allow the butter and eggs to stand at room temperature for 30 minutes. This will make the butter easier to blend. Room temperature eggs allow more air to be incorporated into your batter for a lighter texture. Grease and flour twelve 2½-inch muffin cups or line with paper baking cups (Target); set aside.


Many cupcake recipes call for beating the butter and sugar together for 1 minute, using a hand mixer $34.99 (Bed Bath & Beyond) or stand mixer. This is called creaming, and it creates little pockets of air in the mixture, resulting in light and fluffy cupcakes. Just be sure not to overbeat the mixture. You can tell you've gone too far if the butter starts to separate.

After creaming the butter and sugar, most cupcake recipes next call for adding the eggs. Depending on the recipe, you may add whole eggs, just egg yolks, or just egg whites. Some recipes include other ingredients to add along with the eggs, such as vanilla or other flavorings.

Test Kitchen Tip: Break eggs individually into a custard cup or small bowl first. This way, if you get shell fragments, you can easily fish them out, rather than trying to get them out of the batter.

In a separate mixing bowl (Crate & Barrel), stir together the dry ingredients, such as flour, salt, and baking powder. Most cupcake recipes call for alternately adding the dry ingredients and the wet ingredients (like milk or cream), beating between each addition. Don't be tempted to add everything at once. Adding all of the wet ingredients at once can cause the batter to separate, resulting in a heavy cake. Adding all of the dry ingredients at once can make the batter too thick, which can lead to overmixing.

Wondering how much batter to use per cupcake? For standard 2½-inch cupcakes, fill cupcake liners with ¼ cup batter to about ⅔ to ¾ of the way full. Avoid adding too much batter, or the cupcakes will overflow the cups as they bake and cause a mess. Here are some easy ways to fill cupcake liners with cupcake batter:

If the batter is thick, use two spoons to scoop it into the cups.
Use a medium ice cream or cookie scoop to spoon batter into the cups.
Fill a heavy resealable plastic bag with batter and cut a small hole in one corner. Squeeze the bag gently to fill the cups. Plug the bag's hole with your finger as you move it to the next cup.
If your batter is thin, pour it into a large glass measuring cup. The spout on the measuring cup will make it easier to fill cupcake liners with batter.
Test Kitchen Tip: Cupcakes rise higher in paper liners and are easier to remove from the pan. They're also easier to grasp for frosting or decorating.

For chocolate, vanilla, and most other cupcake recipes, you'll want to bake for 15 to 20 minutes in an oven preheated to 350°F. Test for doneness by inserting a wooden toothpick into the center a cupcake. If the toothpick is clean when you remove it, the cupcakes are done. If wet batter or several moist crumbs cling to the toothpick, they need to bake longer. Cool the cupcakes for 5 minutes in the pan before moving them to a wire rack to cool completely.

Here are some general guidelines for adjusting baking times for larger or smaller cupcakes:

How to make mini cupcakes: A recipe that makes 24 standard (2½-inch) cupcakes will make about 64 mini cupcakes. Generally, they're baked in a 350°F oven for 10 to 15 minutes.
How to make jumbo cupcakes: A recipe that makes 24 standard (2½-inch) cupcakes will make 10 to 16 jumbo cupcakes. Typically, they're baked in a 350°F oven about 25 minutes.

For the prettiest cupcakes, start with decorative liners. It's the easiest way to spruce them up for special occasions. From there, use a piping bag (Michaels) to decorate your cupcakes. If you don't have piping bags, use a resealable plastic bag with the end snipped off, or simply spread with a knife. Use our customizable buttercream frosting recipe (with seven flavor variations) to get started. For an unforgettable dessert, feel free to go wild with holiday toppings, sprinkles, nuts, or whatever your heart desires."

I don't think anyone really reads reviews for Undertale anymore, given that it's been 7 years since its release, and it's arguably one of the most famous indie games of all time, but I thought I'd just leave a review pointing out a part of this game that is under-acknowledged.

Undertale is among one of the very, very few - if not only - to actually promote being virtuous, while simultaneously making the player make the extra effort to be so. The story of the game to one side, the message of it is actually really clear, and very realistic: being virtuous is not always the easy option, nor the most clear one, but a virtuous path always has the best rewards. Maybe I've just not played the right games (if so, please recommend me them), but I have yet to see another game deliver a story as pure and simple, yet realistic (through allegory of course), as Undertale has."

I've just finished my first playthrough of the game and got the good ending. I feel like now's a good time to give some honest thoughts about the game here as someone who didn't absolutely lose their mind over it like so many people did when it came out.

It is a fantastic game.
+The game has a great sense of humor. There were times where it even got me to laugh out loud, here alone in my room like an idiot.
+Everything is just brimming with creativity. The characters, the designs, just everything.
+The characters are all great. I can't name a single character in this game I hated, even the cruelest villains.
+The music is great. I can't even describe it. Just watch the trailer for yourself and get a taste of it.
+You have choices to make, and your choices will affect how the game ends.

I do have one and only one negative comment, but it's not about the game, but more towards the fan base. When this game dropped, people acted like it was the return of Jesus Christ. It was getting to be so obnoxious, that it honestly pushed me away from even wanting to try it for a while. I'm glad to say that I eventually decided to give the game a chance, because it is a damn good game, and I would recommend it without a 2nd thought, and if Toby ever makes another game, he's got my support.

Undertale is a game that took me by surprise and it has left an impression that will stay with me forever. It is one of those magical games that come along only so often. I loved everything about it. The music, the writing, the gameplay, the art. This is a beautiful game that has so much heart and soul. What Toby and his team have created is a classic. If you're still skeptical, please keep reading and try the demo at http://undertale.com!

Undertale is a ""traditional role-playing game where no one has to get hurt"". If you're familiar with most any RPGs, then the basic game mechanics should feel very familiar to you. You play as a protagonist who explores a vast labyrinth, encountering monsters, engaging them in turn based combat, leveling up after gaining EXP, talking to NPCs, and solving puzzles. Despite having all these standard elements, Undertale is NOTHING like any RPG you've played before.

Despite being rather short, roughly 10-13 hours for me, each moment is precious. There's so much attention to detail and you'll find surprises around every corner. The writing is brilliant, filled with humor and wit, and at the end I was hanging on every word. Each character is rich with personality and you'll remember all of them long after you've completed the game.

The combat system is very unique and is one of the first things to stand out about the game. Confrontations are a mix between classic turn-based RPG combat and ""Shoot Em' Up"" mini-games. Each enemy feels fresh and completely different from the next, and that's not even the half of it. Aside from attacking and defending, there's a lot of other fun actions you can explore. Most importantly, the option to refrain from fighting all together.

It's nothing new for a game to let you choose either a violent of pacifist approach, but Undertale takes the concept to a whole new level and is fundamental in what makes it so special. Despite placing you in the role of a vulnerable child lost in an underworld full of monsters, the game wants you to be comfortable, enjoy yourself, and learn to love the universe you're in. It does this so well, that by the end, the thought of hurting anyone or anything in this world will break your heart.

Toby Fox has single handedly risen to my top 5 game composers. He already has an impressive portfolio; you may have heard some of his earlier works from Homestuck. His range of styles and the feelings he evokes is simply astounding. The score for this game is very unique, and maintains a masterful quality all the way through.

Undertale has moved me in ways that only a few others before it could. It fosters so many strong and pure emotions. It will make you laugh and it'll make you cry. It's a world you'll want to fully immerse yourself in and for only $10 it's a steal. The memories I've made with this game are worth infinitely more. Thanks for reading my review. The thought that it may have convinced even one person to play the game fills me with determination!"

In a time when videogames concentrate on just being adictive, eye candy or making profits, Undertale comes and makes us remember why we love videogames so much. I played this game the days after it was released by non ""legal"" methods, and holy gross, what can i say, i loved it.

The game itself its just a cute rpg like earthbound with a simple mechanic that let you spare your ""enemies"" instead of killing them, but it was so well executed in a way that complements the story perfectly. The music on the other hand is fantastic, i still hear it almost every day on my way to college or when i want to chill at home.

But clearly, the most important thing about this game is that it has a lot of heart in it and you can sense that from the very first minutes of the game, its not another game that you buy and leave it in your library forever (i know i have only 8 hours on it but trust me i played it a lot more outside of steam), its the kind of game that makes you convince your friends to play it because you need to talk about it, its the kind of game that makes you search for countless covers and animations on youtube. This game its the kind of game that makes you feel like a child again, getting carried away by the characters and the world in it, making you laugh or cry.

Undertale is my kind of game, and i hope and dream that more games like that will be created in the future.

Happy Birthday Undertale."

I'd definitely recommend this game. It has it's pros and cons like any game would, but I feel the pros out-weight the cons. My main ones are as follows:

PROS
- The game, especially when compared to others I've played, runs very smoothly and have little to no bugs that I can think of.
- The game is deeply story rich. If you have the right mind for it, you can really get drawn into the game from that.
- As I'm sure anyone who's ever heard of the game can say, the audio is wonderful. The soundtracks are beautiful and fit the settings wonderfully.
- While being single-player, I'd never call it a game where you'd get ""lonely."" Some single-player games feel like they drag a bit because there is no one else there, but this one doesn't.
- You get to choose your path. With the different routes available, you can go completely different ways and still end yourself with a wonderful ending.
- The game is easy enough (in pacifist and neutral) to get through within a reasonable amount of time, but it still doesn't feel rushed.
- Being able to name your character is fun if you ask me.
- As far as pixel graphic games go, I'd definitely say this has one of the better graphics.
- The character are all independent, but yet work together well. They have different personalities that are kept constant throughout the gameplay.
- The controls aren't bad.
- It's not overly expensive.
- Good for nearly all ages.

CONS
- The genocide route has a lot of mandatory grinding, which can be tedious.
- (not for me personally but) If you don't like pixel graphics, then that's a con.
- I feel like you can only play it a number of times before getting bored (though that's the same with many other games and I was able to play this for hours without reaching that point).
- The fanbase can get a bit... weird and annoying (but that's just my opinion after going out of the fanbase, so take it with a grain of salt).

Of course, this doesn't cover everything, but it hits all the main things I could think of right off the bat. I definitely do recommend this game and I think it's worth the price."

Undertale, such a young classic. It have the biggest community i've ever seen. To this day, there are some people who create fangames, remixes, alternative universes, animations, and they will create even more. But not that it surprises me, I know why it is that way. It's just awesome. Toby Fox put here iconic characters, tons of secrects, great gameplay, perfect balance between silliness and seriousness, and beautiful story. I personally beaten this game thrice, but every time with this same ending, because in the end of this game, you feel that you helped them, and even they are just a game characters, you can feel the bond with them. Maybe thats a reason why it have that strong community too. This game helped to change gaming industry and in many todays games we can see inspiration or easter eggs from undertale.

If you want to see why this game become so popular, and check if you agree with my opinion, buy it, I reccomend it, with all of the community, especially XTALE."

If you're looking for that next great game to play, you've found it.

Undertale is a game that at first i did not enjoy. In fact I quit playing for a while because I simply could not understand what this game was trying to be. The graphics looked terrible compared to the triple A titles I was used to. However I got past that and gave the game more time and eventually I had beaten one of the endings. Months passed and I got back in on a whim. I decided to play without killing anybody despite my attitude of kill or be killed.
I wont spoil anything, but what I can say is that this game made me laugh and I had a good time sure! but more than that, it made me think. Undertale made me level up as a person.

If you're looking at this game and think it just isnt the kind of thing i'm into, I urge you to reconsider and experience this gem of a game. It will give back what you put into it.

At first I doubted the game would be fun, lacking, and boring, but I was wrong. The game grew bigger in me as I progress deeper, and what inspired me to play more, is not the gameplay, not the mechanics, not the graphics, but the feelings and emotions on the people you meet, this may sound cheezy, but the story will want to make you care about almost everyone. Beautiful and fun game, still hoping for a sequel."

To be honest when i started to play Undertale i had zero expectations, and was sceptical for its hype. Friends whom played the game were like ''Zomg when you're gonna play Undertale? You MUST DO IT!!!!!!1!!!11!'' and when i replied ''Dunno if i even want to..'' oh man, that was almost cardinal crime in their eyes.

However i never judging games before playing them hence adventure started. And after beating (probably) all endings....daaaamn...i haven't been so impressed for ages.

But first things first. Let's analyze the game.
Undertale is Indie RPG (more or less) made just by one guy, which is really impressive. Story isn't linear, it changes by your playing. Decisions you made ACTUALLY MATTERS. For every action there's consequences and that's why i love it.

Battles are interesting. Basically it's bullet hell where you try to survive. But worry not, it's not so hard as it sounds...well.. there are few exceptions but after learning pattern and with dose of determination you can do it.

The characters are so well written and have strong, unique personalities. Makes you questioning moral principes not just in the game but in real life as well.

The best thing (atleast in my opinion) is soundtrack. It's perfect for every situation which you encounter.

Summary: Pros-story, decisions, characters, soundtrack, battles, morals within story
Cons- only found one SPOILERS!- ,also wish it could be a little longer...

My final verdict is 10/10! Legendary game! (Explenation: There's no thing such as 'perfect' game. However this is closest thing what i found. The story worthy of replaying it,brutally changing by your action so you feel like you're playing totally different game and i love this concept.)

So yea....i finally understand why my friends were so obsessed.

Thanks for checking the review. Stay determined."

I've ignored Undertale for longest time. Its fandom was already running rampart, and ignoring their overexaggeration, I thought Undertale was some underwhelming and generic RPG with dull graphics. But... Not until I tried it myself. I thought I would not struggle. I thought I would not shed a single tear to a game. I thought I won't be impressed. I was all wrong... So wrong... Undertale is truly a great indie title, like nothing seen before. There needs to be more games like it.
Now let's go to PROS and CONS, shall we?

PROS:
-Fighting is (mostly) optimal. There will be many parts where its focused on alternative ways of defeating your foe without killing it. It's what makes the game unique. It requires you to be creative and think freely in decision making.
-RPG - RNG = Undertale; Fighting and dodging mechanics are fair and fun.
-Although visuals look simplistic and pixelated, they are not as limited as seen. Prepare to see impressive stuff.
-Interesting puzzles to solve. Even in fights, you have to figure out what is required to spare characters.
-Quite entertaining humor. Sometimes well-thought out, sometimes just small comedy things that makes us smile.
-Loveable characters whose biographies and backstories are scattered around the world.
-Replayability and different endings.

(Small) CONS:
-Although the game bases on choices, some can feel really lack-luster. For example, killing some characters won't affect too much to the game. Killing or sparing everyone you encounter, however, makes big differences.
-Hard-to-come-by choices. Some choices can't be uncovered without trial-and-error. Completely new players won't be able to take every tinniest detail in consideration that it will affect the fate of characters, and it can lead to fatal mistakes and unwanted choices. On brighter side, it adds up as a bonus to replayability.
-Sparing random encounters are very unrewarding and difficult. It's much easier to slay them, as its only way to gain EXP and increase max HP, which will be extremely helpful when wanting to spare major characters by tanking their attacks.
-Healing items have no limitations. Stacking on healing items will make fights easy, even better, when you can dodge majority of attacks. Even if you run out of healing items, the fights will be almost at end anyway.
-Bad currency balance and shops. Most of objects in shops can be found for free by exploring, and the OP healing items are really cheap, while the amount of gold you earn is rather big. Then, there are places that ask for way too much gold. I get that it's supposed to be a joke, but its been done more than once, it's not necessary.
-Useless items. Not counting the jokey ones, many items are just waste of gold and you can complete the game just fine without them. Some do have interesting concept (e.g. similar to in-battle stat buff items and berries from Pokemon), but, I never really seen a reason to buy and use them. Their upsides and downsides are all unbalanced. It's best to just stick to healing items.

Although seem like CONS are much bigger than PROS, but that's because constructive PROS might spoil fun. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND you try this game if you got money to spare, it can last +10 hours depending on how much you explore and/or replay, and it will turn your night into an unforgeable adventure. One more last thing: Don't let the game frighten you with its 4th wall breaking. Stay determined."

Undertale is a game where you, a fusion between Dora the Explorer and the -_- emoticon, fall into a vast cavern that a race of monsters have been trapped in since long ago, and can choose to do tasks, a few of which follow:

-Petting dogs
-Flirting with skeletons/airplanes/your own mom
-Lying on the floor and feeling like utter garbage after a meal
-Striking poses on TV
-Bullying Mike Wazowski
-Accidentally going on a date with a bisexual lizard scientist who is a weaboo
-Hugging goats
-Hugging a volcano
-Petting dogs
-Decaminating the underground area in a bloody massacre
-Getting possessed by a demon
-Petting dogs
-Eating food literally made of spiders
-Determining the realism of anime
-Petting dogs

And that's just a few of the heavy morally weighted you'll have to make in Undertale.
In this world, it's kill or be killed. 10/10"
