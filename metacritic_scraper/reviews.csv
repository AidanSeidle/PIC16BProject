stardew-valley,95,"What do you do when your beloved game series – in this case Harvest Moon – keeps disappointing you? You make your own game, better in every aspect. Every moment spent with Stardew Valley is magical. It’s the Harvest Moon I’ve been waiting for my whole life. [06/2016, p.62]",critic-reviews
stardew-valley,92,"Stardew Valley is without a doubt the best game in the Harvest Moon genre in many years. It has a subtle message about what it means to live a good life and to flourish through a combination of hard work and human connection. The Harvest Moon games all basically boil down to managing a mix of time, tasks, and metrics, and recent entries in the series have relied heavily on exploiting a new gameplay gimmick with each iteration: in one it's crafting structures for the town, in another it's trading with foreign economies. The problem with this approach is that once these gimmicks are exhausted — all the houses built or all the goods traded — the games feel hollow. Stardew Valley succeeds by delivering a robust experience that does not merely rely on watching a meter go up. It has something to say and says it well, while never abandoning the core gameplay that attracted players in the first place.",critic-reviews

You have to plan ahead – farming doesn’t even occur in winter – and your jobs remain engrossing day-in, day-out.

stardew-valley,88,"With so many interconnected systems, from the farm simulation to simple combat and cooking to crafting, and each driving the others forward in some way, it’s a deeper and more complex game than you’d expect after the first day on the farm. There’s plenty to do while I wait to uncover more of the Valley’s secrets, and the prospect of filling my days with new adventures or just a better harvest is too enticing to pass up.",critic-reviews

stardew-valley,7,"Overall this game is a very comfy RPG. There is no real time limit on completing the game but it does have a time system that keeps things moving and keeps me trying to optimize my farm wasting as little time as possible. Which for me is engaging and enjoyable. Mostly you'll be doing the following 1. Farming, 2. Fishing, 3. Mining/Dungeon Crawling 4. Forestry/Foraging 5. Giving gifts and chatting up the townsfolk The more you do steps 1-4 the more money you make or resources you acquire to grow your new farm. Becoming friendly with the townfolk allows some romance options as well as unlocking additional content that they will often send you as recipes in the mail. Each NPC has a birthday so it's good to check your calendar in the morning so you don't miss out on those bonus friendship gifts. Sadly I have to deduct points for the inclusion of Junimo Kart. This mini game is just full of horrible design choices. Really the entire thing is just bad. It's optional for the most part; except some end game quests which are still optional but for such a polished game to include this borderline broken inclusion just bothers me. Here's a list of issues with the minigame: randomly generated levels, unnatural level design, you can jump above the screen and the camera is locked so it's very easy to lose your position, platforms also spawn at the very top of the level (if you jump on them you're blind). I get the dev probably just wanted to include something simple to spice things up but seriously this is worse then flash game platformers from 20 years ago. It's really just a waste of time sadly. If there are any junimo kart enjoyers out there I would honestly be surprised. Journey of the Prairie King (the other minigame) isn't good either, but I would at least consider it playable.",user-reviews

stardew-valley,8,"**** valley is the best farming sim I've ever played, while passage of time feels rushed which takes away from the relaxation the game has a thriving modding community that is usually able to fix your problems and enhance your game. This makes **** a product replayable on the levels of things like Skyrim, always leaving you new ways to play.",user-reviews
stardew-valley,9,"**** Valley is a joy to play. Each in game day takes about 15 minutes to complete and I constantly found myself saying 'just one more day' late into the night. At this point I have had 2 singleplayer playthroughs and played 3 different multiplayer playthroughs. The game is super relaxing, though at the beginning it can feel a bit overwhelming. There is so much to do and not enough energy! Soon enough you'll have cleaned up your farm and get lost fishing an entire day away. You'll soon find yourself planning your next days activity well in advanced. Is it going to rain? How many crops do I want to plant? Man that is going to be a lot of watering if I do that... The main downside to **** Valley is that you really have to give yourself goals. The game is open ended as far as 'beating' the game. I wouldn't say it's hard to 'beat' the game or anything, which really boils down to can you complete a set of different turn-ins the game sets out for you. It can be a bit of a collectathon in someways, but its definitely not egregious. The romance options can seem a bit limiting, but largely this is due to the fact that it took a lot of inspiration from the Harvest Moon series. Of course that really setup the general set of gameplay, but I believe it perfected the art/genre for Harvest Moon style games. I feel its worth mentioning that this game was fully developed by one person, which in itself is a marvel. They did all the programing, music creation, art asset design, and story writing. Everything all molded by one person really is inspiring. If I were to temper my review with this fact alone I would have a hard time not giving it a 10, but I feel like that then no other game could really compare to it, so when comparing it as a whole I'd say it's easily an 85-90.",user-reviews

stardew-valley,9,"(Reseña sacada de mi cuenta de Steam: APolChrome) 80 horas (lo que me ha valido para jugar los 3 primeros años de la granja) de **** Valley y siento que no he visto ni la mitad del contenido. **** Valley es un juego excelente que busca dar una experiencia de calma en la industria. Y es necesario tener juegos como este. En una época que todos los juegos son mundos abiertos masivos con gráficos mejores que la vida real, con un montón de mecánicas, vienen bien juegos así, simples pero que por su premisa sacan prácticamente horas infinitas de entretenimiento. Tengo muchas cosas que decir, así que empezamos. **** Valley ha establecido unos estándares para un género tan de nicho como el de gestión de granja que casi ningún juego va a poder cumplirlos. Recordemos que está desarrollado por 1 persona y el curro que lleva detrás es una locura. El gameplay es increíble. No quiero centrarme en controles (porque no hace falta), pero si en las actividades y el ""loop"" de juego. Este juego nos proporciona 5 maneras principales de conseguir dinero: agricultura, ganadería, recolección, minería y pesca. Cada una tiene distintas mecánicas y herramientas, pero da igual cuál hagas. Eso es lo mejor. El juego nunca te obliga a hacer algo. De hecho, por hacer puedes solo recoger los objetos que hay por Pueblo Pelícano y ya. Pero las mecánicas que rodean a las formas son tan buenas, que vas a hacer todas. Voy a explicarlas un poco. -Agricultura: azada para arar la tierra y semillas para plantar. cada estación tiene ciertos cultivos que se venden a muy buenos precios y que requieren de ciertos días regándolos (cuanto más ****, más dinero valen). Con esto, ya tenemos algo para hacer en el comienzo del día. -Ganadería: criar animales para conseguir objetos. Aunque suene simple, puedes hacerte amigo de tus animales y pueden enfadarse si no les das comida (no ten dan nada). Cuanta más amistad tengan, mejores productos te darán. Otra cosa para complementar al inicio del día con la agricultura -Minería: en mi opinión la mejor. Hay una mina principal (otra está en el desierto de Calico) en la que tienes que ir descendiendo poco a poco, y cada cinco pisos hay ascensor. Es una manera fácil y a la vez arriesgada de conseguir dinero, por los monstruos que hay en la mina. Esta actividad suele ocupar mucho del día. -Recolección: recoger cosas del mapa. Ya está -Pesca: el mejor sistema de pesca que he visto. No se basa en machacar tu dedo contra un botón, sino que tienes que seguir al pez con una barrita verde mientras sube y baja. También genera bastante, aunque depende mucho de la hora del día y la estación. Solo estas 5 mecánicas, hacen que cada día salgas y tengas algo con lo que llenar el día. Ya fuera de esto, la cantidad de cosas por hacer es inmensa. El centro cívico es increíble y aporta al juego una vida útil muy alta, teniendo que jugar todas las estaciones y conocerlas, además de que ayuda a restaurar el pueblo. Esto sumado al museo, que me queda bastante y que se centra en la mina sobre todo, aportando más valor a la minería. La manera de socializar con los vecinos es real. No es como en otros que le regalas cualquier cosa y le gusta. Aquí cada uno tiene sus gustos y te pueden decir a la cara odio tu regalo. Además de que la progresión de todo es muy natural y no se sienten avances ni muy rápidos ni muy lentos. Puedes casarte y formar una familia, ir a un desierto para conseguir más materiales. Los eventos del juego están muy logrados y aunque se repitan en los años, se sienten distintos de cierta manera. La sensación de comunidad es increíble... Me dejo un millón de cosas, pero **** Valley tiene un gameplay perfecto. Audiovisualmente, está bastante bien, sobre todo si tenemos en cuenta que lo ha hecho una sola persona. Los gráficos son buenos, y el estilo artístico muy bonito (con una paleta de colores claros muy bonita) y la OST está bien, no destaca excesivamente pero es aceptable. La narrativa es buena para dar contexto, aunque no tiene mucho peso en el juego. Si que tiene muchas cosas pero no se siente muy completa la narrativa. Resumiendo, **** Valley es tan bueno que ya no podremos jugar a otro juego de granjas sin pensar en él. Hace todo tan bien, que se hace una calma de jugar. Obra maestra y recomendadísimo (pero juégalo por favor no me dejes aquí con la reseña y tú sin el juego)",user-reviews

Se nota que Eric Barone (Creador de ****) le dio mucho amor y cariño a este juego y que aunque este desarrollando su nuevo juego ""Haunted Chocolatier"" que con los avances que nos muestra, se lo ve muy prometedor, no a dejado completamente de lado a ****, por el contrario, sigue actualizando y arreglando pequeños detalles del mismo. No voy a contar nada sobre el juego porque es muy gratificante explorarlo por uno mismo y sorprenderse con cada detalle que nos dejo el creador. Simplemente agradecer a Eric Barone por darnos este mimo al alma llamado ""**** Valley"" y a esperar con ansias su nuevo titulo que se lo ve incluso más adictivo que nuestro juego de granja! The translation of the text into English: I can only define this masterpiece in one simple word: AMAZING. If you're hesitating whether to buy it or not, beyond the fact that the game's price is a steal, especially when it's on sale, I can vouch blindly, with my more than 63 hours spent in this game, that it's worth buying without a doubt. It's incredibly entertaining, with a beautiful aesthetic and a soundtrack that's an absolute gem, very relaxing, but that doesn't mean it won't give you some good battles and challenges. You can tell that Eric Barone (Creator of ****) poured a lot of love and care into this game, and even though he's working on his new game ""Haunted Chocolatier,"" which looks very promising based on the previews, he hasn't completely abandoned ****. On the contrary, he continues to update and fix small details in the game. I won't spoil anything about the game because it's so rewarding to explore it yourself and be amazed by every detail the creator has left for us. I just want to express my gratitude to Eric Barone for giving us this soulful delight called ""**** Valley,"" and I eagerly await his new title, which seems even more addictive than our beloved farming game!",user-reviews

A gameplay do jogo tem um rítmo lento, assim como uma pequena horta em casa requer dedicação, tempo e uma pitada de amor, o jogo possui um sistema de calendário simples de 28 dias (cada dia passa em alguns minutos) em que cada um representa uma estação do ano. A cada dia e a cada estação sua fazenda vai evoluindo e seu relacionamento com os integrantes daquele vilarejo vai se intensificando. Um jogo muito relaxante, gostoso de se jogar, com historia e personagens cativantes, e uma gameplay de simulador/rpg divertida e gostosa. A história apesar de muito simples é fofa e cativante e cada personagem tem seu brilho, trilha sonora e gostosa e a direção de arte é baseada nos jogos antigos.

stardew-valley,8,"There's a lot to like here. Okay, it's not going to give you god rays, superfantastic hyperrealistic graphics, but if you've looked at even one screenshot, none of this is going to come as a surprise. I've taken to playing more indie games these days, as AAA developers have worn me out with the bloat, the tired plots, the microtransactions, and just all-round general greed. It's funny. I'm usually the sort of person who goes for the most realistic (preferably flight and battle simulations), the most hard-hitting, the atmosphere of dread and panic. My idea of fun is being bogged down by Monolith and mutants in the STALKER Anomaly mod just as the damn gun I forgot to maintain jams on me and I leg it in terror. Often straight into an unseen anomaly. Foom. Well, this is the opposite of that. And I really like it. It's gentle, or at least as gentle as you want it to be. I think I ignored most of my farm initially and went on dungeoneering quests to Fight All The Things! Now, I relax, and farm. I say hi to my friendly chickens, rabbits, cows and goats. I grow trees. I get some nice food going. I visit the special holidays where I get to show off my nifty produce. I do a little fishing. I give people presents and hang out. It's nice. It's actually got a fair bit of complexity to it as well, but dammit, I have a good time, and I feel relaxed for it. Took me a while to learn that you can put hats on horses. Mine has a sailor's cap on, and it's adorable. You see what I mean? It's jolly. It's pleasant. It's quite immersive once you get into it. It's also very cute. But cute isn't *all* it is. It's got a lot going for it. If all that sounds bad to you, maybe you won't like it. Though you might. It's a small download, doesn't take up much space on your hard drive, won't work your CPU to boiling point and it's pretty easy to get into, but has more going on than just what is on the surface. If all that sounds good to you, then have at it. You'll most likely have a good time. I had a good time. I still have a good time with it. No one is more surprised than me.",user-reviews

Lo primero es que cualquier dispositivo lo puede correr ya que no necesita mucho RAM, además de eso los gráficos son preciosos y la música simple pero al mismo tiempo especial habiendo momentos en lo que te toca la patata. La historia es muy buena, se preocupa por la historia personal de cada uno de los personajes, cinemáticas especiales con cada uno y más cosas que hacen que descubramos como son los personajes en realidad, además de la posibilidad de poder casarte con un hombre o una mujer sin asumir tu sexualidad, poder tener o adoptar hijos y lo mejor de todo en mi opinión que crecen, no son una cosa para entretenerte o para completar el juego al completo, si no que es otra parte totalmente distinta, de pasar de cuidar animales y una granja, ahora a hijos, un desafío que no es difícil pero aún así engancha y hace que pillemos cariño. El juego se centra en la granja y el cultivar para ganar dinero, pero eso no es todo, puedes cultivar, puede tener animales, puedes dedicarte a ayudar a la gente, a caerles mejor en a la gente, en las minas, en recolectar, en saber la historia de todos, eso es uno de los puntos más fuertes de **** valley, que siempre vas a tener un objetivo que hacer y todos los días van a ser distintos, pudiendo tener una granja de 5 años y seguir sin completar el juego, pero estando avanzado.

stardew-valley,10,"**** Valley has been out for some time. And it's jus something that is so remarkably well done that I'm not even sure a simple review would do it justice. It's a typical farm management sim game with added in RPG elements. Usually, when a game likes this crops up, it's called a Harvest Moon clone, since HM was the game franchise that birthed the love of the farmers life games. But I rarely actually hear **** Valley called a Harvest Moon clone because everything it has, everything it does, it's all HM to the point, but at the same time, it's its own. Eric Barone, the sole guy who made the game from start to finish, made everything from scratch. Art, animations, characters, story, music, scenes. Everything. He was literally a one man team working o what many would consider to be a far too big of a task. He took on a challenge, and over several years, birthed what would become the greatest farmers life sim game that likely will ever exist. Now, let's talk about that exact game itself. What this game is, is pretty much in the most simple of terms a Harvest Moon, Rune Factory or Animal Crossing fans perfect game. It holds a perfect combination of elements from all types of these games rolled into one neat package that presents itself perfectly. (A total of 99%. The 1% difference being the save system.) The game is a time cruncher, it will take you some number of hours to even get through into the second year. The mixture of RPG and farm construction is brilliant. The social element of the game is spot on, not too strong but neither too weak. You're not forced to do a single thing. You're only suggested things to do, and once you're through the intro (which you can skip), you're free to do as you please. I have played so many hours of this game, which is unsurprising after I waited so long for it to release. In just the first hour alone, I felt the £10.99 I paid for it was more than worth it and more. I usually go for more in depth review writing formats, but in this case, everything about **** Valley is so simple yet so wonderful, I'll just use an easy to follow part by part description. Pros- 1. Game world is large and open. Certain areas are locked off and require time to pass by or effort to gain access, making it so there's near enough always soemthing undicovered. 2. Character Customization lets you feel like you've got a rather lovely personal connection to the game and the characters. Be it you want to play as man or woman. Have green hair, green skin or anything that's regular or not so regular. 3. RPG Elements such as fighting and searching through the mines against a variety of monsters is a brillant addition to a traditonal farm sim type of game. (Definitely has one up on Rune Factory.) 4. Character Relationships are progressive, take time and are very believable. Such as you won't gain access to someone's private space (I.E, their room) if you're not a good friend of theirs. 5. Town Feels alive. NPC's will greet one another as they pass by in the town. Something similar past games have always lacked. 6.Build your own farm. Quite literally you can build it how you like. Place wells for water, plant new trees, grow crops where you please. Don't quite like the placement of a certain construct? Just move it with the option to do so being added in for free in a past patch. It's complete free choice. 7. Pets. A dog or a cat. Seriously, who doesn't love pets in a game. 8. Interesting Story with different possible outcomes. There are two in total. 9. Get yourself a family. Woo one of the local 12 single NPC's. Six guys and six girls. Get married, have kids (maximum of 2) and have a happy farm life. Same sex marriage is also a possibility, which is wonderful inclusion. Any potential marriage partner will be happy to go with either gender of male or female. Some elements are even change to reflect this, such as the character Leah. If you romance her as a male, her ex partner will be an old boyfriend, while if you romance her as a female, her ex will be an old girlfriend. 10. Brilliant crafting system that unlocks more things to build as your skill grows in various areas. I.E, farming, fishing, etc. 11. Mini Games can be located in the towns pub, the **** Saloon. These arcade machine works and is impressively well done. 12. Multiplayer for up to four friends to have fun together. 13. The whole game is a gentle, easy, relaxing experience that is perfect to play in order to take it easy and chill. Cons- 1. Awkward save system that could of used a little re-thinking, but it still works just fine. Overall, **** Valley is one of the rare games that deserves the 10/10 score. It's by far one of the best farm management RPG games available and should be in anyone's game collection, as there's something for any gamer to love in **** Valley.",user-reviews

stardew-valley,10,"A beautiful, unforgettable slice-of-life experience, **** Valley is basically everything good about the Harvest Moon formula distilled and then sweetened with its own touch of unique personality. There are catchy, memorable tunes for every season and festival, you get special interactions with basically every villager as your relationships develop, and there's a wild variety of customization options for your farm. You can make a fortune as a cattle ranch, convert your entire property into a bee sanctuary or have large crop rotations managed with automated sprinklers and magical sprites. You're free to take this as a game to relax, enjoying the idyllic fantasy of living in a small, friendly community while managing a steadily improving farm, or you can focus on the relationships you build with the people and get a surprisingly deep level of connection and characterization out of the NPCs. There are literally moments and interactions I still reminisce about years after my first playthrough, and whenever I fire the game up I know I'll end up playing it for dozens of hours.",user-reviews

stardew-valley,10,"**** Valley may look like a simple farming simulator with colorful graphics, but it is much more than that. In fact, it is the best game I have played in quite a while. You are a white-collar worker who one day chooses to walk away and move to your farmhouse left by your grandpa. You start farming, fishing, woodchopping. Seasons last 28 days and each season has its unique dynamics as to what you can plant. For your combat needs, there is a mine you can explore. You can cook, tailor… But most importantly, you interact with your fellow villagers. The game encourages you to talk to them frequently, and at times to give present, do a favor. As seasons pass, you will get to explore different personalities, become friends with people who may not appear nice at first impression. Character development is excellent, thanks to the one-man dev team Eric Barone, a.k.a. ConcernedApe. It’s hard to understand from gameplay videos why **** Valley is perfect at what it’s trying to do. **** Valley is the perfect game for escapism. It educates you with small details and there is a good possibility you may end up becoming a better person, just for having played it.",user-reviews

The game is meant to be played at the player's own pace: you can rush everything and complete any quest that is given to you right after you get it or you can just take your time with it, and get to it when you get to it. It's completely up to you. I have over 300 hours of gameplay and still haven't finished the game because I took my time. Not many games have kept me entertained for over 300 hours of gameplay, but this is definitely an exception to the rule. The story is amazing, the art style is soothing and the gameplay is excellent. It's like a perfect combination of so many of my favorite games packed into one. Would recommend for everybody to play this game :)",user-reviews

Even the joy to be able to watch your farm grow. It pays to invest hours and hours in it, and you will not regret it, much less get tired, because the possibilities are endless.",user-reviews
stardew-valley,10,"**** Valley might appear as a basic farming sim but underneath there is a hidden gem ****. Developed by only one person, this game is made with soul and love and you can see and feel it while you play. Pros: - Atmosphere is calming and relaxing. - Gameplay has a fine line between grind and progress. - Friendship system and romance. The residents of **** Valley have a lot of personality and have heart events which promotes character development. - Variety of things to do, farming, fishing, mining, combat. - Multiple options for replayability, new farm layouts, etc. - Has multiplayer options and in depth option for it. - Soundtrack is lovely and fits for the game. - Bundles, which makes you plan ahead and creates self goals. - Seasons which spice up things with special holidays and events. - The developer has been pushing free updates and is usually available if help is needed. - The game is dirt cheap if you compare it to the hours you would put into the game. Cons - Can be a bit hard to get into the game at first. The game doesn't tell you what to do and you are on your own. You do get some mini quests that push you into the right direction but I've seen people quit before getting into the game. This can be a con or a pro for people. Overall, I can't stress enough how much value this game offers. It has so much soul in it and I recommend it for everyone. Verdict - 10/10.",user-reviews

Ici, le grand-père nous laisse sa ferme et son (immense) terrain en piteux état, ainsi il faut rénover, cultiver et gagner de l’argent pour développer le tout. Si le gameplay est agréable, j’ai quand même l’impression d’avoir fait le tour des choses à découvrir/faire après un peu plus de dix heures de jeu, surtout après avoir atteint le niveau le plus profond de la mine. Je regrette notamment que le plus gros des quêtes consiste a récupérer des objets perdus (je me demande encore pourquoi le short du maire était chez ma voisine !), ou encore de donner des œufs, ou autres… ça finit par perdre de l’intérêt. **** Valley est une belle petite aventure à vivre mais manque en mon sens de quelques éléments supplémentaires pour m’attirer plus qu’il ne l’a fait.

You can play it on pretty much any PC, and it's well worth playing, trust me. Eric Barone, the developer, is also one man whom you can feel confident in supporting by buying his products. He always delivers. Every update is a huge expansion of the gameplay and mechanics, and often times the map, and they are always free.

There's also foraging and fishing (Honestly not a big fan of how fishing works on this game since it has slippery controls that the fish ai ens up abusing it once you find a good catch.) theres several replayable events and a game filled with quest. Honestly this game deserves the high rating it has since it has amazing soundtrack, characters that stand out with allot of dialogues and they also have different interactions depending on how close you are to them with the heart system. The game is allot of grinding but in my opinion it's one of those few games where I actually enjoyed putting hours into, when i first bought **** I literally played for 11 hours in a single day which is unusual for me.

This is a game where you can sink hours into going for just one more (in game) day like you do just one more turn in a Civ style game. Now on 1.4 much of the rougher edges have been smoothed out. Multiplayer works (mostly) and things hum along. You can mix/max it or plant whatever and just have fun, everything is up to you. It feels very short. There isn't much point playing beyond the third year in a regular game and really relies on the very active and supportive modding community to produce DLC level content which breathes new life into the game.

It hangs a little bit too much on randomness but we must remember that most of the game was made by one person. Just one. Really detailed, with a good soundtrack, a really relaxing game. Even if the site says it doesn't have online multiplayer, it actually does now, it's a coop mode that can be used once a player builds a cabin to house another player, which is very cheap and then your friend will live there and share money. It's a experience to be sure.",user-reviews

stardew-valley,7,"A fun and extremely charming game that’s great when you just want to relax and have a good time. It takes the concept of harvest moon and not only makes everything better but it also incorporates new ideas and gameplay mechanics in a brilliant way. Everything from the farming to the combat to the character interactions are great considering the type of game it’s trying to be. Though the game is not without its flaws. After playing it for a while things start to get repetitive and things like farming feels more like real lives chores instead of fun gameplay. The game also loses the sense of meaningful progression after a while and after that it loses traction in trying to push me forward in the game. Though these flaws are only based on my personal opinion and these feelings might not apply to everyone. Overall it’s just what I wanted from this kind of game and I loved playing it. Though it is not one of the most memorable games that I’ve played, it’s defiantly one of the most charming. If the game had clearer and bigger goals to accomplish it would have hooked me for a lot longer but the magic of the game wore of quicker than I would have hoped. But in the end it’s a good game and I would recommend it to everyone that want to play a charming and relaxing game.",user-reviews
stardew-valley,5,"The game starts off with a will from your dead grandpa, who has left you a property in the country that was dear to him. So that you can get away from your desk job (where you use a monitor larger than yourself) and get back to nature and enjoy the simple things in life. Once you arrive at the property you find it in a unkempt state, strange that place grandpa love so much was so run downed. And you begin rebuilding it by doing various tasks and jobs, while getting to know the towns people. The game tries to give off an atmosphere of relaxing and getting back to nature and the simple parts of life, but the mechanics make this a number cruncher were you're trying to maximize your efficacy with each in game day. The in game time moves so fast, that you'll always feel like you need to rush everything in order to get things done in time. To find out what you need to do, you need to go the bulletin board in town, which wastes time getting to and information like characters birthdays are not saved in your journal. So you have to go back to town to keep track of things, which gets repetitive. One of the most time consuming things is socializing with NPCs, so you can get gifts in the mail and progress their story. You increase your friendship with them by giving them gifts, you need to find them first, which can be a challenge as they move around following a schedule that you can only find out about through trail and error. Then you go through more trail and error trying to find out what gifts they like. And character interaction only gives you a single line that repeats until you increase your friendship. Your characters skill progression is really slow, and doesn't show progress to the next level. The skills feel like they should be split up as the foraging skill unlocks the lightning rod and magic totems, while the mining skill lets you transmute metals and unlock cooking recipes. Feels like there should be more skills magic, building, cooking Etc. The game only saves when you sleep, the menu only exits to the desktop and not the main menu, and the map is poorly detailed. The crafting menu is cluttered as it uses the in world sprites for the items. The game uses a grabs every item in range if you have inventory room system, that can be a pain to manage. Doing precise things can be a problem as you interact with items, which either relies on what direction you are facing or where the cursor is. Miss clicks can happen when you use items causing you to waste resources. The game always asks to confirm you eat something. The Fishing mini game is just poorly made and is not fun to play. Mining is can be annoying, as enemies will continue to respawn. A notable bug is, when multiple exit ladders can spawn in a single level but go to the same place. The torches are awkward to use. The art of the game ranges from ok to bad. This game has no focus, it tries to be a relaxing game with its tone and dialog, but its pacing and mechanics make you rush through stuff to avoid wasting resource and chances to progress. I would like to a more focused game from the developer.",user-reviews

stardew-valley,7,"I'm going to be frank here; I don't see where all the hype is for this game. I played and loved Harvest Moon on the GBA and NGC, and thoroughly played Animal Crossing, Minecraft and Terraria. Unfortunately, this game failed to meet the expectations I had after hearing all the hype that it was supposedly an amazing spiritual successor to Harvest Moon. The game is really slow and nothing much happens for long periods of time besides repetitive farming, and not out of volition but out of necessity in order to make the game gradually less grindy. The game doesn't really introduce anything new to the casual farming simulator formula, and I don't see how it is as good as people claim it is. How should I say it? It's like the game doesn't feel satisfying to play. It's as if I'm just pushing on in order to see what happens further on in the game, which isn't much. The only part that's kind of fun to play is the mining because of the battling and exploration, but if that's all I'm playing the game for, I might as well play Terraria instead. I've tried multiplayer as well as installing some mods, which significantly improved my gameplay experience, but I'm still struggling to justify playing the game further. If you want my advice, stick to Harvest Moon or Terraria. You'll enjoy (re)playing those instead of this.",user-reviews
stardew-valley,9,"The **** Farming Sim Out there! Hats off to Eric Barone, the sole creator of **** Valley for creating the **** Farming Simulator out there. For years I longed for a Harvest Moon game with same sex marriage. Year after year, I’d visit the Natsume booth at E3 and ask, “Can i bang a dude yet”? So thank you Mr Barone for letting me be my authentic true self in a farming simulator where also, I have no bills. There also has to be thanks given to Chucklefish for publishing this one-man game. If you don’t know about Eric Barone and the massive undertaking **** Valley took, there are tons of books (Like Blood, Sweat, and Pixels) and articles that include his story and I suggest reading them, but the majority of my review will focus on why I recommend **** Valley. Simple Art for the Simple Heart **** Valley uses simple 2D graphics and is coded in C++. Each sprite is easily recognizable: from the growable vegetables and fruits, to the lovable Pelican Town’s residents (Minus Hailey, not that she’s not recognizable, she’s just not lovable). **** Valley has almost no issue running on any device, which is great for gamers who don’t have tons of resources to build a state-of-the-art PC. In fact **** runs better on PCs better than Minecraft, which is probably why it’s a bestseller. Farm, Fish, Friend, Forage, Find, Forge, FUN If you played games like World of Warcraft and said to yourself “Golly gee I do wish this here fishing profession had a much more substantial role in the economic progression of gameplay” well look no further! In the valley, you’ll be able to get your fishing on, and make an actual impact on your virtual wallet. There are tons of other systems in the game; Farmers can go mining in the caves or even fight enemies with the Zelda-like combat system. You can even ferment wine! What’s really great, is that none of these mechanics are forced on you! If you want to play the game like your real life, you don’t HAVE to court someone into marriage (but like I mentioned, if you want to, you can get it on with a guy like Alex my dream daddy). To top off all these awesome systems, you can manage your farm easily al from a game controller (in my case, a Steam controller). It’s clear the game was designed with using a controller in mind. In fact, the game was designed to be a very customizable experience with both gameplay and hardwear reliance in mind. tl;dr GO BUY **** I like to keep my reviews short and simple with the busy millennial in mind who doesn’t have time to read a giant essay on why the game is good because they’re too preoccupied working their ass off to pay their school debt. Speaking of finances, did I mention **** Valley is only $15?! As I write this, multiplayer has entered into beta, which is highly anticipated. The new FREE patch will be implementing even MORE features, so yes. BUY THIS GAME Recommendations to developer Add a LGBT character that isn’t romanceable. Creating your own story is great, but adding a story that exists for all players is important for inclusion. Add more Horse customization.",user-reviews

stardew-valley,7,"This game has so much love and wisdom. The critics of a modern life are so true. The atmosphere is all about the beauty of a landlife in a village with being committed to other villagers and nature instead of a unnatural live in a city as an employer for a corporation. So, yes this game is about more than just farming simulation. In addition you can fish, explore dungeons, build up your farm, help to build up the village, making friends and even marry. Later on you start to think, what you will do in the day, because there is so much to do and the day time is restricted. Anyway, after few weeks the game becomes repetitive and you feel the need to grind. Another weakness is the bad overview of all the items. There are so many and you need to search, where you need an item you have found. It is not only that you need to look ingame, but also in wiki, to know what to do with it -> Fun killer. This all should be ingame and easier to manage. Graphics looks really too old and simple. The good thing is, it is looking sweet and fits to the whole atmosphere of the game: not modern graphic.

stardew-valley,5,"This is an excercise in reuse of coding, with RNG as the main gameplay mechanic to fill in some (very limited) sense of unexpectedness. Most of the artifical game mechanics are hidden, forcing you to be yet another wiki-warrior, wading through countless pages of information that shows how little logic or balancing is in **** Valley. When you realize the lone developer designed this to allow you to easily maximize profits if you already know what you are doing, most of the crops can be skipped as they are only useful for in-game achievements which have not actual gameplay value except as the freemium gold star which is what this should be most famous for. Basically, **** Valley is a freemium-like game that pats you on the head repeatedly for doing very little, which seems to be exactly what many people apprectiate (or do not realize what is happening to them). When examined as a whole it does not really qualify as a game since there is no way to win, or to lose. Once you realize that, you can skip days at a time which quickly robs this of any meaning at all. If you have endless hours (50+) and OCD, then this piece of software is for you. If you actually want a game, a sim, or some combination thereof, look somewhere else (as of Jan. 2018).",user-reviews

In **** Valley, not only they are gone, but here we have a lot of improvements, like ability to move everything around (furniture in your house, items you place on field like sprinklers). I love the idea of sprinklers.

I had been interested in this game since launch, and I finally got my hands on it in the Steam Summer Sale. To my surprise, this little indie gem managed to far outreach my expectations. I can easily describe the feeling of playing this game with a single word: pleasant. In a medium where the are violent, bloody, action-packed games, this was a nice game where you could wind down and just have fun. That's not to say that they don't have a place in gaming, The Last of Us, Skyrim, and Uncharted 2 are some of my favorite games of all time. It's just that this was different and it was different in a good way. Anything you do in **** Valley is optional. Want to go mining to advance you skill with the sword and pickaxe? Well, you don't have too. Want to fish to gain friendship with the local sailor and deliver them to the townsfolk? You don't have to. This is a tranquil, peaceful, beautifully designed world where, if you wish, you can just sit on your porch and listen to the soft, atmospheric music. Luckily, the fact that nothing is really pushing you to do anything does not make mining, fishing, fighting, or questing any less enjoyable. The singular, lone developer has put in so much content and has created a world that **** you in as soon as you see the title screen. Almost everything I have to say about this game is positive except for one excusable, tiny thing. The only problem is that when you marry a townsperson, the dialogue is replaced with less interesting lines. I think that it shows how good a game is when the only real problem aside from random bugs and glitches (which really only do things like showing light a night when there are no fireflies).

A Farmville with actual gameplay if you will. By its slow-paced nature, **** Valley constantly seeks to teach the life lesson to take your time and not worry so much about what must be achieved. While the long-term goals may be present for you, you cannot achieve them all in one day or sitting - the game has no intention of you doing so. If you're tired of other games offering you the dopamine drip or are feeling a need to slow yourself down in general, I highly recommend **** Valley.",user-reviews
stardew-valley,9,"This game has a depth to it that I was not expecting when I first purchased it as a time-killer. **** Valley is a fantastic game that successfully brings back the nostalgia of the SNES-era Harvest Moon title while infusing it with new concepts and depth to bring it into the current era of gaming. The game is simple enough to learn and play and makes an excellent game for couples to play alongside each other as the game was easily picked up and played by my non-gamer girlfriend with minimal problems. The player starts as a farmer with basic tools and an overgrown farm in a small run-down house. From the beginning, the player is tasked with restoring the farm to its former glory, but how the player accomplishes this is up to them. They can clear land and plant crops to sell at a profit, build barns and coops to raise animals to sell their eggs and milk for a profit. They can fish. They can mine. They can adventure. **** Valley empowers the player to go at their own pace and do what interests them. There is no real ""correct"" way to play the game. There is a simple fun in experiencing milestones, whether that is leveling up a skill to earn a perk, upgrading a tool for increased inefficiency, or watching as the villagers become more friendly with you. Players can become friends with townsfolk, learn their backgrounds (Some of which are incredibly well-written emotional stories), and even date and marry the man/woman they desire. You can decorate your home. You can become a mainstay in the village by repairing the community center, and many other nuanced things. I found myself becoming invested in the little village and its characters and particularly enjoyed the routines of the villagers to be an interesting addition. (""Oh, oops, of course the store is closed on Tuesdays, she's over at the Fitness Group!"") The graphics are clean, and the music/sound effects are enjoyable to listen to. All of this is even more impressive when you consider that the entire game was made by a single individual. **** Valley is a fantastic game for folks who are looking for a different type of game - especially those who enjoy experiencing growth and progress. There's a great satisfaction from delivering a good harvest and spending your money. I really recommend this game - it was an absolute joy to play and holds a great charm.",user-reviews
stardew-valley,8,"Charming, but lacks the ability to keep me playing in the long term. Granted, I've put in about 60 hours at this point, which is more than a lot of games but I don't feel like there is anything left for me to get out of it. I think the true power of this game is its ""grindy"" addictive nature. It's like farmville on steroids without **** micro-transactions. It's not really a new or groundbreaking thing, but harvesting, mining, and fishing in this game somehow scratch this indescribable itch I never knew I had. A good game to be sure, and well worth the money, but I don't know if I will ever go back to it.",user-reviews
stardew-valley,9,"**** Valley is another farming simulator that is reminiscent of the old 2D Harvest Moon games. What it does better than the Harvest Moon games is that it does not gate its content behind time limits. From the very beginning, you're able to complete any of the objectives presented to you in game provided that it is the right season. After playing the frustration that was the latest Story of Seasons that required you to sit through 4 years of game time to unlock everything, this was a nice refreshing change. The story is fairly plain and there's not much that develops it, but it doesn't matter in the long run. My only complaint is the rather small inventory size, especially when a single item has at least three item qualities meaning that it can take up three item slots.",user-reviews
stardew-valley,9,"This is an excellent game overall. There are not many issues with it, other than there is no endgame. I enjoyed this game a lot, but it could use some improvement. That being said, the amount of content in this game, despite it only having one person working on it is impressive.",user-reviews
stardew-valley,10,"You can tell this game was crafted with passion. The core gameplay is similar to cookie clicker - grow A to sell for $100 so you can buy seeds for B to grow and sell for $500 and so on, but what really impressed me was how well the game conveys the feeling of living in Pleasantville USA. The townspeople are friendly with a bunch of different personalities and secret problems. I'm usually a very ""get the OP weapon and beat the game as fast as possible"" type of player, but **** Valley is one of the very few games where I enjoyed messing around as much as I enjoyed trying to best my own high scores.",user-reviews
stardew-valley,10,"I've been delaying writing a review of this game because I wanted to give it the full attention that it deserves. So that's delayed me from writing anything because to truly explain how impressed with this game I've been and how enjoyable it's been would take forever... to sum it up; before this game came out, I hadn't been so excited for a games release since I was a kid and I found out about the release of Harvest Moon SNES in the Nintendo Magazine. The hype slowly dwindled with each predecessor with a few occasional gems - but more recently all the new farming sim games have been shells of the past great games. **** Valley promised a lot, and it delivered a lot. Its pre-release hype, for me, matched the level of satisfaction that I got out of playing the game. Pros: Graphics - reminiscent of the HM for SNES but blended perfectly with the new indie style used in similar games. Music - great sound track Storyline - enough to make sense, quiet enough to let you do what you want Farming – Brilliant execution, diversity of crops, diversity of livestock Crafting – amazing idea to include an HM style game and executed very well Side Stories – Really great moments that bring life to the town Same-Sex Marriage – Long time HM fans of the LGBTQ variety (and allies) have literally been begging Natsume to include this and our voices never heard Misc. – Fishing, Mining, Questing, plenty to keep you busy and keep you creating your own adventures Cons (though despite existing I should still point out I find the game near-perfect): Tutorial – For me this wasn’t an issue but for friends that I got into the game, they found the game a bit difficult to get into and came to me occasionally for help. Festivals – I like the festivals (concerned ape I swear I do you did great overall!) but I felt that they were lacking a little bit of depth – maybe varying the prizes from year to year or something, not sure what the solution would have been. Random Events – would have liked more random events, but not a huge deal. Crafting – I love the crafting system, but by the end of the second year, I wanted more new recipes to pop up Overall this game is a 10/10 for me. I recommend it to anyone that loves this genre and anyone that loves a good indie game. It’s for the die-hard fans and it’s for the new entries. Concerned Ape is amazing and I’d drink any koolaid he told me to drink. This game, and CA’s attention to rapid updates at the initial release, is a testament to what a dedicated developer who cares about the genre and the community can do. So hats off to Concerned Ape and a huge congratulations, you’re amazing, this game is amazing, never change.",user-reviews

I'm so used to these being Japanese games, but this game definitely feels more western, it is hard to pin down exactly why. It is kind of refreshing! The game looks fantastic, sounds fantastic!

stardew-valley,3,"I think a lot of people must hold some kind of nostalgic view with this game. I couldn't play it more than 30 minutes. If you are into Harvest Moon (I was not) you will probably like this game. For me, the gameplay is boring, the story is not engaging, and the crafting system is clunky and confusing. It is incredibly frustrating trying to get into a game only to need to use a wiki article to figure something out like 5 minutes in. I wouldn't spend more than a couple of bucks on this game, and even then it wouldn't be worth it for me.",user-reviews
stardew-valley,9,"I absolutely love this game. I became interested in the game when I heard about it on all of the usual video game websites. I've never played a game like this before, but my girlfriend loved Harvest Moon back in the day and we are both are in love with this game. It is one of the first games we've ever played where we can both play. Are growing farm has 1 of each animal, all given nicknames very personal. A goat that has a combination of my in-laws names for his own. A pig named Porkins in honor of the Star Wars character, because why not!?!? Being able to give personal names to these animals, your child, your farm, etc. Make the property and assets you own in the game feel like your own, you're more invested. The gameplay loop is satisfyingly addictive, and there's a lot of flexibility in how you can play the game. My first play through was mostly focused on a moderate amount of farming, lots and lots of foraging, mining, and fishing to make a little extra income so I could gradually level up my tools. My second play through was noticeably different. Focusing heavily on crops and saving up to buy next season's crops in bulk, I was usually so tired after watering all of the crops, I usually didn't have enough energy to fish, mine, or cut down trees. My time was then spent putting more focus into befriending people (because it doesn't use energy, the game's version of stamina.) and I have the excess crops to afford that kind of generosity. It pays off though. The recipes and perks of being good friends with your neighbors allows you to learn new recipes for food that can restore that crucial energy meter, or they can send you the odd gift like useful supplies for the farm. Those are two different play-throughs with two very different consequences. Want to do nothing while your farm makes it's own money? Craft 3 dozen bee boxes and let them generate $100 (or even more if you place them near flowers) per bee box every 4 hours. Want to be the country's largest producer of pumpkins? Use every square inch of your farm to plant 2600 pumpkins... Have fun watering them every day. Or you can become a spelunker and dig down into the mines and try and collect as many minerals and resources as you can get. There are many ways to make money in this game. That freedom is yours to decide. Controls are a mixed bag with a gamepad, I've had a few head slapping moments where seeds, walls, floors, fertilizer were placed somewhere they shouldn't have been. Does it affect the gameplay much? No, it doesn't. But when it does happen, 1 or twice every few hours of gameplay, it reminds me that a keyboard and mouse is the best way to play this game. But if you're a gamepad gamer like myself, don't be dissuaded to ignore this game. The game mostly functions well, I have come across a few glitches in the game, but most of those have been resolved by a dedicated 1-man developer who's interacted with the booming fanbase **** that he passionately made on his own within 4. He's constantly releasing patches, there have even been occasions where he has personally helped repair save files of people who have lost progress on their game. This is a very personal game that should not be overlooked. Play the game the way you want, get **** into the gameplay loop of ""One more day"" while your eyes are red and you're staring at the computer screen at midnight when you have work tomorrow.",user-reviews

stardew-valley,10,"I was pleasantly surprised by this game, having never played something even remotely similar I was a little skeptical when I bought it, but I am so glad I did. The graphics are lovely and charming and really sets the tone for the game, and the game play while relatively simple has yet to become boring and lack luster. But what really made me love this game was how quickly I came attached to the characters, the town, etc. Starting off as the new guy in town and slowly integrating yourself into the community has been something that I have found so rewarding. If you are even remotely interested in this game, please give it a try, an easy 10 and one of the most engaging and addictive games I have every played.",user-reviews

I love that I cracked open a notepad and have it open on my other screen with the calendar events written on it and a few other notes for quick reference. So far every time I think I may have hit a dry spot for grinding something else gets thrown in the mix. You don't have to do anything, if you don't want to farm that's ok, and it seems like a lot of people skip out on fishing, but I do think I'm going to be trying my best to 100% this. It's so calming after a day of errands or work and is just a very nice way to unwind.",user-reviews

stardew-valley,9,"**** Valley was presented to me as ""a farming game"". What an understatement that does not do it justice. It offers roleplaying elements, exploration, progression, crafting and building - all in a good 16 bit look. At first the game seems to ask the player for basic chores - and the days seem to be too long for the few things to do - but very soon there is such a huge list of things you want to do that the days seem way too short ... and the actual farming seems to take away too much from what might be considered ""spare time activities or hobbies"". Balance of time management, rewards and progression seem fine to me. There is a lot of freedom to act and choose. Do you want to perfect profit? Do you want to socialize with the townsfolk? Do you by chance become a dungeon crawling adventurer? - or a lot of other things. **** Valley is one of those games that i believed to be rubbish when i heard of it first.... a pixel farming game (yea - like that is fun... ) - but it turned out to be not only fun, but utterly amazing. Now - at that point i cannot make a judgement about its long term/end game state. I reckon that - once the player has established a near perfect income basis and befriended most of the town or found out most locations backstory and lore - there won t be too much to do anymore. But up to that point - there is plenty of fun to be had ... especially for the price.",user-reviews

Right away the general ambiance and feel of the game grabbed me, the layout of the area, in game sounds and music, character progression and the way time and seasons are handled are all done well. There are no linear game play limits you find in so many other games, you are free at the outset to explore, farm, fish, gather, attend events or not.

I can't suggest this any higher to anyone that liked Harvest Moon, Animal Crossing, or just any relaxing game to play.",user-reviews
stardew-valley,0,"I'm shocked. - Graphics are pre-historic and the 2D sprites are ""ok"" at best. - Sounds and music are very basic and have MIDI quality. - Characters are bland and lack personality. - The gameplay mechanics are boring and repetitive. The combat mechanics is ridiculously uncreative. I felt insulted. The gameplay in general, lack any depth. Everything is a chore, and due poor time management mechanics, it's impossible to not be stressed by this game, And if you want to gift those bland NPCs, be prepared for more stressful time trying to catch them. And about the story, well, I'm afraid I can't really complete a review because after the first year I stopped playing and deleted this game. Only the thought of going trough all this again was too much for me. I can't think of anything but give this game a solid 0.",user-reviews
stardew-valley,10,"I never played Harvest Moon so I do not have much basis for comparison. Yet, what I can say is that this game seems masterfully made and is addicting as all hell. It took me a couple of in-game days to get into it and understand it, but everything was simple and self-explanatory enough that I was able to jump right in. It was really an inspiration to learn that it was just one guy that made this game and what a job he did. The art is great, the music is great and all of the characters have such specific backstories and behaviors that you'd think a whole team made it. I noticed a couple of glitches, but nothing game breaking. My biggest issue with the game though is in the lack of settings and options. I would like to be able to play at work, but I cannot make the screen small enough to do so. Additionally, volume control is limited to music on or off. I also would like to be able to save other than at the end of a day, but I can see where that's ultimately problematic from a design perspective. ConcernedApe, you da real MVP.",user-reviews

BUT BAM! **** Valley came out and though trepidatious I was I took the plunge and boy do I have no regrets. It's difficult to point out just what **** Valley does that is so much better but I would gander that it has something to do with the interminable list of upgrades, collections, and quests that keep you playing. I am nearly 30 hours in and I want to get married, get the bus to start working so I can mine in the desert, get a bigger barn, get a bigger coop, upgrade my house so I can have a child, donate my rare finds to the museum so they give me sweet gifts, collect all the rare scarecrows **** much other stuff.

I won't write a giant review, simply because I agree 100% with IGN's. I'd suggest going there and reading it. It's a game with a lot of diversity, from growing crops and raising livestock, to fishing, to exploring the mines, to developing relationships with the townsfolk, to customization of your farm, to completing quests, etc. It mixes Harvest Moon and Minecraft, and it's a marriage made in heaven! Usually I do appreciate good graphics. But for this type of game you don't need it and I don't even notice now. There is one negative I can see in the game: the social aspect. It lacks depth. I think VG developers have improved in this area a lot in the last decade, so I may be spoiled in that regard. I just felt it was lacking in **** Valley. Villagers don't have a whole lot to say, and unique events are limited. I would have loved to see this part fleshed out a lot more. Regardless, it's an amazing game.

stardew-valley,9,"Alright if you're like me and you read the negative parts first, go further down, but if you want to hear what I love about this game first then read on. First of all I really love Harvest Moon type games ever since I played Animal Crossing on the Gamecube, when I saw **** Valley on Steam, I initially thought it would be a small Indie game that'd keep me interested for maybe 20 minutes or so. 35 hours later I finally realized that this game is not perfect, it's not even the game of the year, but what it is, is good. As of right now I'm in the winter of the first year. It's fun, it's simple, it's cute, it's casual, it's nostalgic. Things I like about this game: 1. It's basically Harvest Moon 2. It's easy to get into and doesn't have much of a learning curve. 3. There's always something to do. 4. There's story to it which I'll explain soon (No spoilers!) 5. It teaches you to hate big industries that step on small businesses. Things I don't like about this game: 1. I have half an hour, I'll play **** for a bit (Two hours later)> Winter is Coming, I'd better stockpile this hay. 2. One.. more.. day.. 3. It takes X days for Y vegetable and you want it tomorrow? 4. My Dog is useless. 5. I spent the entire day looking for you.. and you don't like my gift? 6. To hell with fishing (The Next Day)> I'll give it a go again. 7. What do you mean the shops close at 4PM? 8. Slimes. The Story: Okay the general story is, you're a city-slicker, your Grandpappy said to you ""Kid, one day you're going to get sick of City life and when you do you're going to open this envelope I give you that you take with you to work"" So that happens and you get the deed to your Grandpa's farm, you spend the next year (And more years) fixing up the place, starting your own farm whilst participating in festivals the town holds and helping the villagers. The gameplay: The gameplay is casual, it's simple, it's fun. Controller compatible, there's complex parts of it and it can take some planning, like you'll wake up and watch the weather channel, find out it's raining the next day and you'll maybe take the time that rain saved you from watering your crops and maybe use it going in the mines or fishing or even giving gifts to villagers that you can't bloody find where they're hiding at so you spend the entire day looking for Abigail because she's not helping her Father at the shop. Fishing is difficult, not negatively, it's a challenge and I enjoy it, but I dread everytime I get an errand that says ""Catch X fish and deliver to Y Person"". It's repetitive in the sense you'll live like a farmer, you get up every day water the crops (except in winter) and when you have them you'll nurture animals (So far I only have chickens) the average day (except in winter) has me doing this until about 10 AM and then I'll either: Forage for wild plants, tend to my land (Chop trees, break rocks, cut weeds), go fishing, go mining or on very rare days I'll just go to sleep and do it all again. The one thing this game has that drives me mental is a poor sense of direction sometimes. Like I'll be trying to till a spot of earth, but because I'm partially stood on it, it'll do the next one over (I have the slow placement grid option on which helps) and the amount of times I've accidentally killed a crop or broke a fence because of this is too damn high. It's a small complaint but if it were removed the game would be perfect to me. My final verdict: If you have a lot of time to burn, whether it's twenty minutes before bed or six hours before you go out clubbing, just remember to set an alarm and inform the people you love to come looking for you, or you may wake up infront of the Pearly Gates trying to think of what to tell the Gatekeeper when he asks what you're doing there because you starved yourself playing for too long. Seriously, the game is 11 Sterlings (£) it's so cheap and if you like -anything- I mentioned above it's worth it, honestly the cons of this game are insignificant and the pros are plentiful. Oh and it's moddable, yeah. Happy Farming!",user-reviews

I Am a huge Harvest Moon fan and the two are definitely similar. However, you can tell that there was so much more heart and soul put into this game than that of Harvest Moon. For those of you that don't like the fishing...I felt that way at first but I gradually got the hang of it and found it to be quite fun. Awesome job ConcernedApe. This is quite an accomplishment!",user-reviews

This is a game with so much character and truly dedicated attention to detail, I wish I could give it a hug, and tell it how special it is. It's an ode to that marvelous old farming game which sings with a delightful glee that reminds you so much of why you pine for the founding era of game design. A one-man developer has produced what feels like it could have been done with an army of artists and designers. Bravo, ConcernedApe.",user-reviews

stardew-valley,9,"Having never played Harvest Moon or Animal Crossing, this primarily reminded me of Chocobo's Dungeon 2, with a greatly expanded out-of-dungeon playset - which is fantastic. This game's **** me in for three days straight, which hasn't happened to me in years. Things are subtle and deep - not overplayed and always obvious (stay away from the Wikia except maybe to look up where fish are, btw!). It does require a pretty insane amount of time (luckily[?!], I just burned off most of my right hand so am out of work for a couple weeks) - so this might not be for someone who doesn't have time for anything but bite-sized chunks (you can't save at will, unfortunately, unless you go to sleep early). I'm having trouble praising it because I instinctively want to balance it but don't have many bad things to say about it. The run speed is dreadfully slow, but there are plenty of ways around it (I went with ""**** Injector"" and set runspeed to 2). There're also two games here -- there's stuff that doesn't work (grinding; watching the TV every morning for recipes, chopping TONS of wood, gifting [this should probably be redone from scratch...], farming), and stuff that carries the game to a 8-10 rating (surprise unlocks and lots of RNG tables, cool stuff to craft to make your already-cool unlocks become even better items, way more content than I think anyone would anticipate even after playing a full 10+ hours). I struggle to make cheese in real life - and love the stuff, so when I first got to milk a cow and saw cheese in the community center bundle, I knew all my milk was going in the fridge until I unlocked something to transform to cheese, and I really can't explain why it was so thrilling to finally make my first batch, but it was, so great on ConcernedApe for getting me giddy as a schoolgirl about making virtual cheese. -And now I save my cheese because I know one day, I'll unlock some awesome recipe and I'll be using cheese power to blast through the crystal mines down to level 50+ without breaking a sweat. It's such an enjoyable time investment that even as someone who looks down on losers who invest boatloads of time for a string of data in a program, I get **** right in to the same thing, and I don't even feel dirty about it. -So congratulations on discovering this game. Go out and buy it, now!",user-reviews
stardew-valley,10,"TL:DR - Buy the game. Now. Seriously. No... just do it. The best $15 you will ever spend. I loved Harvest Moon as a young teen, and when I saw this on GOG, I nearly fell out of my chair. Then I fired up the game... it was a lot more than Harvest Moon. It was amazing. Lots of depth, plenty of things to do, lots of secrets, and plenty of surprises hit me dead in the face.",user-reviews
stardew-valley,6,"I bought and spent most of my time playing **** Valley this weekend. I wish STEAM had a better system then simply to recommend it or not, because a lot of times, that isn't the best or easiest answer. **** Valley is a 'Harvest Moon' inspired farming/realtionship simulator with a dash of dungeon crawling and crafting thrown in. The graphics are appealing and the music is well done. Unfortunately if you are already familiar with this kind of game play and mechanics, **** Valley really isn't all that creative, unique or innovative. The biggest problem with this game is, there has been many, many games, like this before it, that has done a significantly better job at what **** Valley is trying to achive. It's a farming simulator, but anyone aware of Harvest Moon can tell you it does a better job. It's a dungeon crawler, but only in the lightest of senses. And even then, Rune Factory not only did it better, but offered a huge selection of spells, skills, abilities, weapons, varying dungeons and even bosses. It's a crafting game, but the fact is, it offers much less then more traditional crafting games such as MineCraft or Terraria. It suffers from classic issues such as vague quests, plots and more. It can be a massive grind at times and can end up being incredibly tedious, to the point some people may become frustrated. And while multiplayer was initially announced, it's been pushed back for a later date (if we ever see it). Is it just me or is that completely disappointing? The one thing it could have done to really set itself apart from it's predecessors and it doesn't do it. And now that the game has been fully released, how can we expect to see that feature? 'Don't Starve' had to do a completely separate release to account for multiplayer aspects. What it boils down is, **** Valley isn't a bad game. I enjoyed the time I spent so far with the game, but, it doesn't really do anything new or innovative for a genre that has been around since the 90's. **** Valley is really very mediocre. Hopefully, in time, with a few updates pushed out, they'll prove me wrong.",user-reviews
stardew-valley,2,"I don't get it. It has graphics from the 1980s (which isn't cute, it's just **** It involves a large amount of formulaic grinding to water plants, mine bits of rock and collect other random crap (much like what I imagine farmville is like).",user-reviews

stardew-valley,10,"In recent years, the Harvest Moon series has died down some over the course of several new games, where the next one does not really add anything new to the last. Until now, the only alternative to the series has mostly been Rune Factory, which is also a very good series. This game, however takes the good from both series and breathes new life into the formula. It has many elements that any player of either series would be more than familiar with: farming crops, raising livestock, fishing, and mining. And everything is timed with the daily clock and monthly calendar dates, with special events happening every so often. These categories work the same way as their inspirations for the most part, however there are some key differences. A big over-arching change is that your farmland is almost completely customizable. Other than your house, there is nothing that is pre-placed, and your land area is gigantic. This allows for a fully customized farm that is unique to you. Fishing has a minigame instead of automatically catching whatever you hook; at first, the minigame is extremely difficult, but it does not take long to get used to. Farming also comes with conveniences that never existed before, such as upgradable sprinklers that water tiles of your crops for you (the amount depends on the level of sprinkler) as well as several kinds of fertilizers that have different effects on your crop. Raising animals is mostly the same, however the range of animals that you can care for is vast, including chickens, ducks, goats, pigs, and cows. All of these areas of the game work well, and as one would expect, with there being plenty of variety in all three. Any of these elements can be completely ignored if desired and the player can still make a profit. There is no rush to get to anything at a certain time (for the most part) and the game can be played at your own pace. Mining can be best described as a combination of Rune Factory's combat and Harvest Moon's cave systems. Each floor has a ladder that needs to be found to move on to the next floor, with there being better ore, minerals, gems, etc to mine the deeper you go. Inside the mine are various monsters that can be killed, sometimes even required to kill. The combat is simple, where LMB swings your melee weapon, holding LMB charges up a slingshot, and RMB does various special actions depending on the weapon. However, the simplicity works for the game, as you are always on the clock, and if it were too complex there'd be too much time spent fighting. There is something special at the very bottom of the mine, giving even more reason to explore it. Of course, a Harvest Moon inspired game would not be complete without interactions with the townsfolk. The system is the same as it is in Harvest Moon, where you can talk with villagers and give them gifts to get them to like you more. Unlike Harvest Moon, you can only give two gifts per week, meaning the progression of affection is a lot slower unless you complete quests or special interactions with each villager. So long as you give the right gifts and complete the special tasks, it still will not take too long before your chosen bachelor or bachelorette can be married. Despite everything the game does right, there are some issues with it. The running speed is atrociously slow, especially with diagonal movement. You do eventually unlock a horse, but the horse only speeds up diagonal movement; the vertical and horizontal run speeds remain the same. In addition, the bachelors and bachelorettes vary from each other with personality, however they are fairly two dimensional with their personalities. The developer also apparently had a stroke at one point because if you look at the progression of their appearances, there is a point where they gradually become worse and more same-faced, losing some uniqueness to them. There is also a very unfitting anti-corporation message in the game that could have been left out. The overall graphics style is up to personal preference, but I personally like it and think it does a good job creating the comfy atmosphere these games are known for. Lastly, the game is capable of being fully modified due to how simple the engine is made. Every pixel can be changed, and mod tools are in the process of being created to add extra content. There is already a mod that changes the appearances of the bachelorettes to an earlier time, as a result of many individuals wanting them altered. So who knows what the developer and modders will add to the game in the future. In conclusion, this game has just as much if not more content than any of the more modern Harvest Moon games yet is half the price. There are some aspects that I did not even mention such as the sewer dungeon and what is basically the Harvest Sprite tasks because I am 18 hours in and still haven't finished either of those things, nor have I seen everything the game has to offer yet. I highly recommend it.",user-reviews

stardew-valley,10,"I dont usually write reviews and even less review games on steam, but this is totally an exception. As i progress further into the game i'll update, but i got pretty much information to give on you guys for now. Im a big Harvest moon fan, actually not that much, in fact the only ones i played was Friends of Mineral Town and Back to Nature, and ow boy, Back to Nature... i've spent easily 500+ hours on that game, it is just so good to start something with barely nothing and turn it into a big thing (That's why i love games like Tropico 5,XCOM, Total War ETC). I know its boring but i'll need to make a lot of comparisons with Harvest moon Back to Nature (because it was the only one i REALLY played and enjoyed) First off by the story, you are the grandson of a farmer which lives in a small town called **** valley, its not explained if you lived with him or not (probably not), one day, he leaves you a letter, and asks you to open it when you grow tired of the City life. Twenty years have passed and you are working for a company called Joja which is somewhat a parody or critic of the today's companies, ""enslaving"" his workers. One day at work, you grow tired of being exploited and decides to open the letter, only to find out you grandfather has left his farm all to you, to start a new life. Well its pretty much back to nature, but there you live in the city and visit your grandfather in vacations, people already knew you basically but from what i remember he stopped visiting and got somewhat forggoten. his grandpa dies and he gets the farm. So my point is, this is not a ripoff, i was so glad to see such familiar storyline, but from now on things really change so don't be mad. So you are introduced to your new, devasted, overgrown land, 500 moneys and 15 seeds as a gift from the mayor, so with hard work you need to transform a terrible once forgotten farm, 500 bucks and 15 seeds into a money-maker machine, restore the town's economy and bring the people together again. (i'll explain) So, Joja gets in the city, everything is different, people likes TV more than hanging out, the once high populated city hall is destroyed and the economy is really bad, so it's up to you to maybe kick joja out (i don't know yet if this is a possibility) So let's go to some things you can do and have: -You have some basic tools, which is used to: chop trees down,mine ores and rocks,watering crops,prepare the soil, fishing and foraging. -There's plenty of ways to make money in the game, including your primary crop plantation in your farm (beside animals like chickens giving you eggs), Mining, Fishing and even fighting and looting monsters!!!! -Socialize with other people and even marry and (maybe) have children -Participate in festivals held by the locals -Have a pet like a cat or a dog So now i'll list somethings different than BtN. -There are monters, yes! you can actually fight them and loot them, they are pretty though tho, but you can upgrade yours weapons and equipment in the guild hall. -Bigger Map -Bigger and more beatiful farm land -You can craft and build items like chests, scarecrows, sprinklers, furnacers etc (Im missing things for sure so don't hesitate to comment and correct me) Overall its pretty much the same mechanics about farming and etc and i completely love it! Although there is somethings i didn't liked -Females are not cute like the Harvest moon ones (I really preferer those japanese stylish art for women) -The guys are really cool and the girls not so much, there is one that has a band and rides a skate sometimes! -The energy system really needs an overhaul, its frustating in the start but becomes too much underpowered on the early to mid game!! -The TV could use some more work The soundtrack is simply amazing, it really gives you this ""farm"" feel! This is a great game, and it was made by one guy only (which has worked on StarBound) buy it now if you love Harvest moon like me or if you like micro management games like Tropico 5,Sim City etc, its really worth its price, i've been playing this for 5 hours straight, no recent games has done this to me, so this is a GREAT sign! Really, JUST BUY IT!!!!",user-reviews
stardew-valley,9,"'**** Valley' doesn't just breathe new life into a dying concept; '**** Valley' gets on it's bare knees, leans over in tears, passionately breathes into it over and over even though the Doctor already said ""it's dead, stop trying"", pumps the chest liberally, and doesn't give up until something good happens. And that something good is this game. The 'Harvest Moon' franchise has been a mixed bag over the last decade, and the same can be said for the spinoff series 'Rune Factory'. Fans took the good with the bad and went with it because they were holding onto something special. Today, the Harvest Moon series barely exists on it's own. 'Story of Seasons' and other life sim titles have come along to replace it with mixed success. Well, if you loved those series then '**** Valley' is what you want to play. An indie dev has revived the concept...with an obvious passion for 'Harvest Moon' and an insane attention to detail. I know, right? I didn't see it coming, either.",user-reviews
