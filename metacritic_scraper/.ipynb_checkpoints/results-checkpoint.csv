minecraft,"4J has turned in an accomplished port, boasting crisp, high-resolution visuals and a reorganised inventory...In terms of console sims, nothing touches it. Minecraft's world is one that everybody should experience. ",100,Critic
minecraft,"Minecraft is an excellent port of the famous PC game. At a glance you'll have a hard time noticing the differences. The Xbox 360 version is way more accessible though thanks to a way clearer crafting system. Veterans should skip this version, because the PC-version boasts many more options.",90,Critic
minecraft,Minecraft is just as addictive on the Xbox 360 as it was on the PC. Too bad the world is only a small fragment of that of the original game. [June 2012]   ,86,Critic
minecraft,"This version is somewhat limited compared to the original, but overall it is a decent adaptation and absolutely obligatory for anyone who has never experienced the game on PC.",80,Critic
minecraft,"Minecraft for Xbox 360 is a solid conversion and much more user-friendly than the PC version. The new split-screen mode is a great way to experience Minecraft with others. There are some issues, though, and the main problem is the small environments which removes a lot of the exploration that was so fun on the PC.",80,Critic
minecraft,"If you don't need mods and prefer to play on your Xbox 360, Minecraft: Xbox 360 Edition is much better built than its PC partner. Long time fans will no doubt find some of the differences disappointing - for instance the world is limited to 1024x1024 - and while this is small compared to the PC version, with an 8 player multiplayer limit it's still massive. If you are looking to finally see what the fuss is about, Minecraft: Xbox 360 Edition is an excellent purchase. ",75,Critic
minecraft,"If Minecraft on the PC is the video game equivelent of LEGO, then Minecraft on XBLA is Duplo. It's a perfect introduction to the game and its experience-but it won't take long for you to outgrow it and want the real thing.",55,Critic

minecraft,"I have spent soo many hours in this game, I don't really know if would want to know the number. There are so many different aspects to explore in this game: creative building, vanilla survival, technical red stone, exploring worlds, online game modes, just to name a few. It's fun to play on your own, but it can even be more fun to play with friends. There are so many memories that were made while playing minecraft, thank you for existing.",10,User

minecraft,Good but can get a bit boring to play. Their is no way to download mod packs or anything to spice up the game.,7,User
minecraft,Minecraft is overall a good game with lots to do. Its really fun with a friends in co-op. It has many ports but I feel any console version of Minecraft is great as it feels better with a controller. Its far from perfect but it can offer a great experience. Try it out.,7,User

minecraft,If you are going to be new just don't even get Minecraft. It was way better back in the day and isn't worth a buy now unless you get it under 5 bucks they are trying to add too many stupid stuff.,4,User
stardew-valley,"Far more than just a farming game, this one-man labor of love is filled with seemingly endless content and heart.",100,Critic
stardew-valley,"Stardew Valley is without a doubt the best game in the Harvest Moon genre in many years. It has a subtle message about what it means to live a good life and to flourish through a combination of hard work and human connection. The Harvest Moon games all basically boil down to managing a mix of time, tasks, and metrics, and recent entries in the series have relied heavily on exploiting a new gameplay gimmick with each iteration: in one it's crafting structures for the town, in another it's trading with foreign economies. The problem with this approach is that once these gimmicks are exhausted — all the houses built or all the goods traded — the games feel hollow. Stardew Valley succeeds by delivering a robust experience that does not merely rely on watching a meter go up. It has something to say and says it well, while never abandoning the core gameplay that attracted players in the first place. ",92,Critic
stardew-valley,"Stardew Valley is the best and most entertaining farming RPG to come along in years, and it's filled with such sheer charm and sincerity that it'll instantly win you over.",90,Critic
stardew-valley,Stardew Valley is an absolutely charming little gem about forgetting all your worries and relaxing on a farm.,90,Critic
stardew-valley,"Though some quirks might unnecessarily keep players at arm’s length, those willing to grapple with the more arcane aspects of Stardew Valley are in for a world of delight.",88,Critic
stardew-valley,"Stardew Valley is like Harvest Moon, but with a lot more content.",85,Critic
stardew-valley,"Despite all odds, it seems Stardew Valley is a different game than the one it mimics. And a pretty fun, different game at that.",73,Critic

stardew-valley,"Overall this game is a very comfy RPG. There is no real time limit on completing the game but it does have a time system that keeps things moving and keeps me trying to optimize my farm wasting as little time as possible. Which for me is engaging and enjoyable.  

Mostly you'll be doing the following
1. Farming, 
2. Fishing,
3. Mining/Dungeon Crawling
4. Forestry/Foraging 
5. Giving gifts and chatting up the townsfolk

The more you do steps 1-4 the more money you make or resources you acquire to grow your new farm. 

Becoming friendly with the townfolk allows some romance options as well as unlocking additional content that they will often send you as recipes in the mail. Each NPC has a birthday so it's good to check your  calendar in the morning so you don't miss out on those bonus friendship gifts. 

Sadly I have to deduct points for the inclusion of Junimo Kart. This mini game is just full of horrible design choices. Really the entire thing is just bad. It's optional for the most part; except some end game quests which are still optional but for such a polished game to include this borderline broken inclusion just bothers me. Here's a list of issues with the minigame: randomly generated levels, unnatural level design, you can jump above the screen and the camera is locked so it's very easy to lose your position, platforms also spawn at the very top of the level (if you jump on them you're blind). I get the dev probably just wanted to include something simple to spice things up but seriously this is worse then flash game platformers from 20 years ago. It's really just a waste of time sadly. If there are any junimo kart enjoyers out there I would honestly be surprised.

Journey of the Prairie King (the other minigame) isn't good either, but I would at least consider it playable.",7,User
stardew-valley,"É um bom jogo. No começo você vai ficando lotado de coisas para fazer e a medida que passa se torna mais algo repetitivo e lento.  No entanto, é um jogo com uma boa ambientação, trilha sonora e personagens. Bom para jogar com os amigos, anima muito mais o jogo.",7,User
stardew-valley,It's an extremely overrated game. It is boring and has a lot of control issues.,4,User
stardew-valley,"Really boooring, not fun at least for me. It has some fun things but after 40 hours it doesn't get better than that. Soundtrack is awful too and sound effects-",4,User
